SCOPUS DATABASE CREATOR - BEGINNER-FRIENDLY SCRIPT
==================================================

This script converts Scopus CSV files into optimized SQLite databases for research.
It's designed to be easy to use, even if you're new to programming!

WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
- Takes Scopus CSV files (exported from Scopus.com) as input
- Converts them into organized SQLite database files
- Automatically filters out low-quality data (always enabled for best results)
- Can handle single files OR entire directories with multiple CSV files

HOW TO USE:
  python create_database.py <scopus.csv>        # For a single CSV file
  python create_database.py <directory>         # For a folder with multiple CSV files

EXAMPLES:
  python create_database.py my_scopus_data.csv
  python create_database.py data/scopus_exports/
"""

# Import required Python modules
# sys: Lets us access command-line arguments (what the user types after the script name)
# Path: Makes it easier to work with file and folder paths
