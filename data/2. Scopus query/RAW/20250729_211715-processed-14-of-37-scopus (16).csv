Extensive work has been performed by the research community to develop these correlations for the numerous designs. However, with the new technology of metal additive manufacturing and the resultant surface roughness, the traditional correlations and design considerations related to performance need to be adjusted. As a result, two metal additively manufactured offset strip fin heat exchanger geometries with different fin spacing are studied for heat transfer and pressure drop performance and compared with traditional correlations. Deviations between the additively manufactured geometries and previous correlations for smooth fins are found and are further amplified as the surface roughness-to-hydraulic diameter ratio is increased. Furthermore, the surface roughness from the additive process results in a constant friction factor behavior at high Reynolds numbers, which is unlike behavior observed for conventionally manufactured fins. Considerations for both the laminar and turbulent flow regimes are needed for correct performance prediction. A final offset strip fin geometry with a change in the fin spacing every third of the way through the flow path is tested. This study found that the orientation of fin spacing, wider spaced to tightly spaced or tightly spaced to wider spaced, did not have a significant effect on pressure drop or heat transfer. However, the study found a method for predicting the performance which will become important as additive manufacturing increases the complexity of heat exchanger designs.

The proposed energy-harvesting system consists of a dual-band circular monopole antenna (CMA) array, an impedance transformer, and a RF rectifier. The CMA array is printed on the circular substrate having a radius of 0.007λ g2 to achieve a compact size. The single-stage Villard rectifier converts the RF signal to dc voltage and the impedance transformer matches the impedance between the antenna and the rectifier. The proposed rectenna is 3-D printed on a biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) substrate using fused deposition modeling (FDM) of 3-D printing. The experimental verification is carried out in RF ambient environment using a horn antenna and RF signal generator. The fabricated configuration offers conversion efficiencies of 72.2% and 51.21% at 2.4 and 5.2 GHz, respectively. The simulation and test results of the proposed configurations are in good agreement.

The process parameters of FDM could influence the mechanical properties and quality of a product. FDM process parameters are optimized using an evolutionary strategy algorithm. Pareto optimal solution was used for investigating the effect of process parameters. Dynamic mechanical testing was performed on the predicted optimal FDM process parameters obtained from the Pareto optimal solutions. Further, the impact of additives on 3D printed PC/ABS (polycarbonate/acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene) composite blend was investigated. The proposed optimization technique maximizes the storage modulus and minimizes the loss modulus. Experimental results also show that dynamic characteristics such as storage and loss modulus of material satisfy the optimization technique solutions. An increase in storage modulus from 13.6 to 43.7 GPa and a decrease of loss modulus from 7.92 to 1.92 Gpa was noticed with varying tetrabromobiphenol-A (TBBA) and microcrystalline cellulose contents in PC/ABS composite. Also, the results of the damping factor of the material are lower and resulted in the best viscoelastic property of the additive-based PC/ABS composite. Therefore, the developed 3D printed composites are potential applications in the manufacturing industry. © 2022, ASM International.","dynamic mechanical analysis; evolutionary strategy algorithm; fused deposition modeling; microcrystalline-cellulose; optimization; tetrabromobiphenol-A","Additives; Cellulose; Deposition; Dynamics; Polycarbonates; Viscoelasticity; 3D printers; Additives; Cellulose; Crystalline materials; Dynamics; Elastic moduli; Evolutionary algorithms; Layered manufacturing; Mechanical testing; Polycarbonates; Viscoelasticity; A cellulose; Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene; Deposition modeling; Evolutionary strategies algorithms; Manufacturing industries; Micro-crystalline cellulose; Modeling process; Optimisations; Process parameters; Tetrabromobiphenol A; Deposition","","","","","","","Popescu D., Zapciu A., Amza C., Baciu F., Marinescu R., FDM Process Parameters Influence Over the Mechanical Properties of Polymer Specimens: A review, Polym.

However, the mechanical properties of sheet lattice structures with rotating orientation should be further investigated to utilize the unique properties of lattice structure fully. In this paper, the structure with a graded rotation angle from 0° to 45° (DGRS) is designed and manufactured by selective laser melting (SLM). Then, the mechanical properties of DGRS are compared with that of other lattice samples, namely, non-rotating structure (DNS) and the structure with a uniform rotation angle of 45° along the x-axis (DRS). The experimental results demonstrate that DGRS has the highest plateau stress and more stable stress variation at the post-yield stage than other samples. The numerical simulation exhibits dispersive equivalent stress distribution in DGRS, which could alleviate the local stress concentration in the joint area of the lattice structure. Additionally, DGRS shows superior energy absorption capability. © 2022","Energy absorption; Finite element analysis; Lattice structure; Mechanical properties improvement; Selective laser melting","Energy absorption; Melting; Selective laser melting; Stress concentration; Structural properties; Yield stress; Finite element analyse; Functionally graded; Laser melting process; Lattice structures; Mechanical property improvement; Rotation angles; Selective laser melting; Sheet structure; Surface-based; Triply periodic minimal surfaces; Finite element method","","","","","China Scholarship Council, CSC, (202006050041)","This research was financially supported by the China Scholarship Council (CSC) and grant ID is 202006050041 .","Lee N., Horstemeyer M.F., Rhee H., Nabors B., Liao J., Williams L.N., Hierarchical multiscale structure-property relationships of the red-bellied woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus) beak, J.

The acquired data are beneficial for understanding the influence of the microstructure on mechanical properties. During the alloy’s selective laser melting (SLM), the melt pool boundary was almost parallel with the scanning direction, and the grains grew along the building direction. When the load-bearing face was perpendicular to the melt pool boundary, the crack propagation path deflected towards coarse melt pool of the melt pool boundary, reducing the probability of directly crossing the fine melt pool. Otherwise, the cracks would mainly propagate along the melt pool boundary. In the tensile deformation process, coarse melt pool (CMP) was subjected to higher local strain than fine melt pool (FMP) and heat-affected zone (HAZ), and the crack propagated or deflected along the CMP in the melt pool boundary. Therefore, the anisotropy of mechanical properties in SLM AlSi10Mg was mainly ascribed to the CMP density on the load-bearing face. As a weak area, the high proportion of CMP significantly reduced the strength and plasticity of the alloy. Graphical abstract: In order to investigate the anisotropy of mechanicalproperties of SLM AlSi10Mg, the damage mechanism andfracture behavior of transverse and longitudinal specimens werestudied. CMP of the melt pool boundary is the weak zone. Thenthe schematic illustration for the crack propagation was madeaccording to experiment results. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Korean Institute of Metals and Materials.","AlSi10Mg alloy; Anisotropy; Damage characteristic; Fracture path; Melt pool boundary; Selective laser melting","Anisotropy; Bearings (machine parts); Crack propagation; Cracks; Density (specific gravity); Fracture; Heat affected zone; Lakes; Melting; Selective laser melting; Tensile strength; Alsi10mg alloy; Boundary orientation; Crack propagation path; Damage characteristic; Fracture path; Grain grow; Load-bearing; Melt pool; Melt pool boundary; Selective laser melting; Alloys","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51761003, 52161019); Guizhou Science and Technology Department, ([2019] 4011, [2020]6006); Natural Science Foundation of Guizhou Province, ([2017]5788)","This work was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.52161019 and 51761003), Natural Science Foundation of Guizhou Province, China(No. [2017]5788), One Hundred Person Project of Guizhou Province, China (No. [2020]6006), and the central government guides local science and technology development (Grant NO.

Though powder bed density is considered one of the most critical factors to control and predict green density, their difference has not been fully understood. In this work, experiments and simulations were employed to investigate their difference for a free-flowing powder in a counter-rotating roller powder spreading system. Using an alumina powder with excellent flowability, both experiments and simulations show that powder bed density is higher than green density. Furthermore, simulations provide an in-depth understanding of the density difference. Specifically, in the powder bed density scenario where particles are able to move across different powder layers, a slower powder flow with a smooth velocity transition is observed. In the green density scenario where powder is spread on a printed powder layer, the confined layer space generates a powder flow with higher velocity and more turbulence. As a result, the powder packing structure in the green density scenario has more void space near layer interface than that in the powder bed density scenario. This paper reports a reason for the difference between powder bed density and green density for the first time. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Binder jetting; Green density; Powder bed density","Additives;

As the RS can be deleterious to the fatigue resistance of engineering components, great efforts are focused on understanding their generation and evolution after post-process heat treatments. In this study, one of the few of its kind, the RS relaxation induced in an as-built PBF-LB/M AlSi10Mg material by a low-temperature heat treatment (265 °C for 1 h) is studied by means of X-ray and neutron diffraction. Since the specimens are manufactured using a baseplate heated up to 200 °C, low RS are found in the as-built condition. After heat treatment a redistribution of the RS is observed, while their magnitude remains constant. It is proposed that the redistribution is induced by a repartition of stresses between the α-aluminium matrix and the silicon phase, as the morphology of the silicon phase is affected by the heat treatment. A considerable scatter is observed in the neutron diffraction RS profiles, which is principally correlated to the presence (or absence) of pockets of porosity developed at the borders of the chessboard pattern. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Heat resistance; Heat treatment; Neutron diffraction; Temperature; C: heat treatments; Engineering components; Fatigue-resistance; Laser powders; Post process; Powder bed; Process heat; Residual stress relaxation; Residual stress state; Silicon phase; Residual stresses","","","","","Institute Laue-Langevin; Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie, HZB; Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung, (MIT1-2019-40); UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (51147); UK Research and Innovation, UKRI","Funding text 1: This work is supported by internal Bundesanstalt f\u00FCr Materialforschung und\u00A0-pr\u00FCfung (BAM) funding (MIT1-2019-40).

Mechanical properties of the SLM 316 L SS with different volumetric energy densities (VED) were obtained at high-velocity deformation by using a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB). With strain rate increased, compressive strength of the SLM 316 L SS peaked at the strain rates of 1200 s−1 - 1450 s−1. Analyzed molten pool and mechanical properties of SLM 316 L SS at the strain rate of 1200 s−1 - 1450 s−1, the SLM 316 L SS with volumetric energy density of 145.83 J/mm3 had a combination of minimum overlap ratio of molten pool and maximum single pass molten pool width, which brought maximum pool size and exhibited excellent impact energy and compressive strengths, reaching 1185 MPa and 125.4 MJ/m3, respectively. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were used to characterize molten pools of the SLM 316 L SS. Microcracks appear along molten pool boundaries of the failed specimens was found and poor deformation coordination ability due to the misorientation of grains on both sides of molten pool boundaries makes the molten pool boundary as the weak region. Overlap ratio of the molten pool and theoretical width of the single pass molten pool are considered to be main factors in determining the molten pool size, which in turn determines mechanical properties of the SLM 316 L SS at high-velocity deformation. Further, in the process of dynamic compression deformation, microcracks were formed at the molten pool boundary, which lead to failure of the SLM 316 L SS. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Mechanical property; Microstructure; Selective laser melting; Stainless steel","Austenitic stainless steel; Compressive strength; Deformation; Density (specific gravity); Melting; Microcracks; Scanning electron microscopy; Selective laser melting; Transmission electron microscopy; Velocity; 316 L stainless steel; High velocity; Microstructural modification; Molten pool; Overlap ratios; Selective laser melting; Single pass; Strain-rates; Velocity deformation; Volumetric energy densities; Strain rate","","","","","Anhui Polytechnic University of China; Central South University of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52020105013); State Key Laboratory of Powder Metallurgy, SKLPM, (202262102172)","Funding text 1: The present work was financially supported by the National Natural Science of China (No. 52020105013), and by the State Key Laboratory of Powder Metallurgy (No. 202262102172).

However, the presence of fiber such as kenaf in polymer filament could cause mechanical properties degradation with regard to the fiber loading owing to low compatibility between natural fiber and polymer matrix. Therefore, this study aims to study the mechanical properties of three-dimensional (3D)-printed structures of composites specimens with varying volume percentages of kenaf fiber. From the tensile and flexural testings, the findings revealed decrements in the tensile strength and modulus of kenaf fiber-reinforced ABS (KRABS) composites from 0 to 5% contents of kenaf fiber which were 23.20 to 11.48 MPa and 328.17 to 184.48 MPa, respectively. The raising amount of kenaf fiber at 5 to 10% raised the tensile strength and modulus from 11.48 to 18.59 MPa and 184.48 to 275.58 MPa, respectively. Flexural strength and modulus of KRABS composites were decreased at to 5% from 40.56 to 26.48 MPa and 113.05 to 60 MPa, respectively. With further kenaf fiber addition from 5 to 10%, the flexural strength and modulus were increased from 26.48 to 32.64 MPa and 60 to 88.46 MPa, respectively. These results were supported by the finding from the morphological analysis, where the presence of porosity and fiber pull out implied the poor interfacial bonding between kenaf fiber and ABS matrix. This study has successfully demonstrated the tensile and flexural performances of different volume percentages of KRABS composites filament for FDM through experimental research. © 2022, The Author(s).","ABS composite; Flexural properties; Fused deposition modeling; Kenaf fiber composite; Tensile properties","Bending strength; Deposition; Hemp; Kenaf fibers; Layered manufacturing; Reinforcement; Styrene; Tensile strength; ABS composite; Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene; Fibre composites; Fibre-reinforced; Flexural properties; Kenaf fiber composite; Polymer filaments; Property degradation; Tensile and flexural properties; Volume percentage; Fused Deposition Modeling","","","","","Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka, UTeM, (FRGS/1/2020/FTKMP-CARE/F00456); Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka, UTeM; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia and Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka for the financial support provided through the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS/1/2020/FTKMP-CARE/F00456).

Because of that, a post-process is needed to improve the surface quality. Drag Finish (DF) is a surface enhancing operation based on removing small amounts of sawdust from the workpiece that is in contact with abrasive media. This study presents the effect of the drag finish post-processing parameters on wear and surface features of additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V samples. Processing parameters considered are abrasive media, processing duration, and speed. This study reveals that the surface roughness of as-built specimens can be reduced up to 94% by implementing appropriate process parameters during post-processing operations. Drag finish also results in work hardening on the surface of the specimen and hence increased hardness of the treated surface by 6%. This eventually helps to improve the wear resistance of additively fabricated specimens. © 2022, ASM International.","additive manufacturing; drag finishing; laser powder bed fusion; post process; Ti-6Al-4V","3D printers; Additives; Drag; Fabrication; Strain hardening; Surface properties; Surface roughness; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Wear of materials; Wear resistance; Abrasive media; Drag finishing; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Post process; Post-processing; Powder bed; Processing parameters; Surface integrity; Ti-6al-4v; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Marmara Üniversitesi, (FEN-C-YLP-250919-0271); Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, UTM, (00P07, 08G37)","This work was also supported by the Research Project Program of Marmara University (BAPKO, Project FEN-C-YLP-250919-0271).

Herein, we overcame the insufficient strength of Ti-10 Nb alloy used in orthopedic implants by introducing an Ar + N2 reactive atmosphere during selective laser melting. The mechanical properties, phase compositions, microstructures, and biocompatibility of the Ti-10 Nb alloys formed under the reactive atmospheres containing 3 vol% and 5 vol% N2 were investigated. Scanning electron microscope, electron backscatter diffraction, and transmission electron microscope were employed to investigate the mechanism of N on the mechanical property evolution of Ti-10 Nb. The biocompatibility of the Ti-10 Nb alloys fabricated under different N2 concentrations was investigated using in vitro cell proliferation and adhesion assays, with pure Ti used as a reference. The Ti-10 Nb alloy displayed a tensile strength of 855 MPa, yield strength of 763 MPa, an elongation of 21.6%, and elastic modulus of 72 GPa when the N2 fraction was 3 vol%. The as-printed Ti-10 Nb alloy exhibited good biocompatibility, and the introduction of N promoted the proliferation of MG-63 cells. This study paves the way for the synthesis of high-strength and low modulus biomedical Ti alloys by reactive additive manufacturing. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Biocompatibility; Mechanical properties; Near-β-type titanium; Selective laser melting","Additives; Argon lasers; Biomechanics; Cell proliferation; Elastic moduli; High strength alloys; Melting; Niobium alloys; Scanning electron microscopy; Selective laser melting; Tensile strength; Titanium alloys; Transmission electron microscopy; High-low; High-strength; Low-modulus; Nb alloys; Near-β-type titania; Reactive atmospheres; Selective laser melting; Strength modulus; Titania; β'' type; Biocompatibility","","","","","Construction of Regional Innovation System; Cross Regional R & D Cooperation project, (20221ZDH04054); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51971108, 52171036); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, (JCYJ20180504165824643); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality; Southern University of Science and Technology, SUSTech; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2020B1515120013); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","This research is supported by Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (No. 2020B1515120013 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51971108 and 52171036 ), Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission ( JCYJ20180504165824643 ) and the Central Guidance on Local: Construction of Regional Innovation System - Cross Regional R & D Cooperation project ( 20221ZDH04054 ).

However, even when we adopt a reduced model with simplified physics, the complex geometries of parts usually produced by the LPBF AM processes make this kind of analysis computationally expensive. In fact, small geometrical features—which might be generated when the part is designed following the principle of the so-called design for AM, for instance, by means of topology optimization procedures—often require complex conformal meshes. Immersed boundary methods offer an alternative to deal with this kind of complexity, without requiring complicated meshing strategies. The two-level method lies within this family of numerical methods and presents a flexible tool to deal with multi-scale problems. In this contribution, we apply a modified version of the recently introduced two-level method to part-scale thermal analysis of LPBF manufactured components. We first validate the proposed part-scale model with respect to experimental measurements from the literature. Then, we apply the presented numerical framework to simulate a complete LPBF process of a topologically optimized structure, showing the capability of the method to easily deal with complex geometrical features. © 2022, The Author(s).","Immersed boundary method; Laser powder bed fusion; Multi-scale analysis; Part-scale thermal model; SS-316L; Two-level method","3D printers; Additives; Geometry; Numerical methods; Topology; Turbulent flow; Additive manufacturing process; Immersed boundary methods; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Multi scale analysis; Part-scale thermal model; Powder bed; SS 316L; Thermal model; Two level methods; Thermoanalysis","","","","","Italian Minister of University and Research; Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR, (20173C478N, 2017L7X3CS)","This work was partially supported by the Italian Minister of University and Research through the MIUR-PRIN projects “A BRIDGE TO THE FUTURE” (No. 2017L7X3CS) and “XFAST-SIMS” (no. 20173C478N).

In this work, irregular SLM lattice structures made of titanium (cp-Ti) with an average beam thickness of 300 μm and an average porous size of 600 μm were investigated. Optimal processing conditions of SLM for obtaining irregular open-cell cp-Ti lattice structures with mechanical and porous geometry close to human cancellous bone were developed. It was observed that the main parameter of SLM affected on beam thickness is volumetric energy density. Influence of orientation of cubic samples on the construction platform (on the plane, on the edge or on the corner) on properties of lattice structures was investigated. The corner orientation was found to be optimal. It was shown that chemical etching is effective post-treatment method for obtaining required beam thickness and removing the attached powder particles. Optimal chemical etching conditions are the following: etching solution contains 30 mL HNO3 + 45 mL HF + 120 mL water, etching time is 10 s. The elastic modulus and the elastic limit of etched lattice samples are 1.4–1.9 GPa and 44–51 MPa, respectively, which correlates with characteristics of human cancellous bone. Compression of samples during mechanical tests occurred without beams destruction. Corrosion characteristics of obtained etched and non-etched lattice structures in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) have been improved compared with cp-Ti bulk samples. The biological and medical tests of the obtained samples will be carrying out to determine biocompatibility, influence on the growth of bone tissue, permeability, etc. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Biomedical application; Cancellous bone; Lattice structure; Mechanical properties; Selective laser melting; Titanium","","","","","","Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka, (K2-2019-012, К2A-2019-034)","The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation in the framework of Increase Competitiveness Program of NUST «MISIS», contract № K2-2019-012, К2A-2019-034.

Methods: We utilized 3D printing (3DP) technology to rapidly prototype and test critical components for a novel ventilator multiplexer system, Vent-Lock, to split one ventilator or anesthesia gas machine between two patients. FloRest, a novel 3DP flow restrictor, provides clinicians control of tidal volumes and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), using the 3DP manometer adaptor to monitor pressures. We tested the ventilator splitter circuit in simulation centers between artificial lungs and used an anesthesia gas machine to successfully ventilate two swine. Results: As one of the first studies to demonstrate splitting one anesthesia gas machine between two swine, we present proof-of-concept of a de novo, closed, multiplexing system, with flow restriction for potential individualized patient therapy. Conclusions: While possible, due to the complexity, need for experienced operators, and associated risks, ventilator multiplexing should only be reserved for urgent situations with no other alternatives. Our report underscores the initial design and engineering considerations required for rapid medical device prototyping via 3D printing in limited resource environments, including considerations for design, material selection, production, and distribution. We note that optimization of engineering may minimize 3D printing production risks but may not address the inherent risks of the device or change its indications. Thus, our case report provides insights to inform future rapid prototyping of medical devices. © 2022, The Author(s).","3D printing; Austere medicine; Covid-19; De novo system; In vivo study; Limited resources;

The diamond lattice cylindrical shell (D-LCS) was designed using the proposed method and fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM). The experimental tests were conducted to investigate the energy absorption performance of these structures under quasi-static axial compression loading. The finite element (FE) models were established and validated using experimental results. Furthermore, the influence of the design parameters on the deformation modes and energy absorption performances of the D-LCSs were studied by parametric studies. The results showed that the D-LCS exhibited superior energy absorption performances compared with its counterparts. The relative density, cell size, radial variation coefficient, and mapping angle had significant effects on the deformed modes and energy absorption performances of the D-LCS structures. The findings of this study were expected to facilitate the design of the D-LCS structures for energy absorption applications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3D printing; Energy absorption; Lattice cylindrical shell (LCS); Triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS)","Axial compression; Crystal lattices; Cylinders (shapes); Mapping; Selective laser melting; Shells (structures); Structural design; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Absorption performance; Compression loading; Cylindrical shell; Diamond lattices; Lattice cylindrical shell; Shell structure; Triply periodic minimal surface; Triply periodic minimal surfaces; Energy absorption","","","","","WUST national defence pre-research foundation, (GF202010)","We acknowledge funding from the WUST national defence pre-research foundation ( GF202010 ).

The Achilles’ heel of additive manufacturing mould is the cooling channels close to the surface which generate high stress concentration and are not machined; as a result, they create weaknesses in the part and are likely to reduce the lifespan of the mould. It is necessary to study the impact of such channels on properties (fatigue, residual stresses, microstructure) and determine optimized laser strategies to reduce porosity that may occur near a contour. Residual stresses were first estimated above an internal channel after different heat treatments, and fatigue specimens were printed with a 3-mm diameter channel on an EOS M270 printer using different strategies such as several contours with a concentric offset. The impact of these strategies on fatigue properties was analysed through microstructural observations. Here, it was found that a double contour with an offset improved the fatigue life of the part by more than 10 times compared to the standard single contour strategy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Additive manufacturing; Conformal cooling; Laser powder bed fusion; Tools","3D printers; Additives; Cooling; Fatigue of materials; Maraging steel; Molds; Achilles' heel; Conformal cooling; Conformal cooling channels; Cooling rates; Cycling time; Fatigue properties; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Mold inserts; Powder bed; Residual stresses","","","","","UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (60300); UK Research and Innovation, UKRI","","Kang J., Shangguan H., Deng C., Hu Y., Yi J., Wang X., Huang T., Additive manufacturing-driven mold design for castings, Addit Manuf, 22, pp. 472-478, (2018); Kuo C.C., Jiang Z.F., Lee J.H., Effects of cooling time of molded parts on rapid injection molds with different layouts and surface roughness of conformal cooling channels, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 103, 5, pp. 2169-2182, (2019); Kuo C.C., Jiang Z.F., Yang M.X., You B.J., Zhong W.C., Effects of cooling channel layout on the cooling performance of rapid injection mold, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 114, 9, pp. 2697-2710, (2021); Shakerin S., Hadadzadeh A., Amirkhiz B.S., Shamsdini S., Li J., Mohammadi M., Additive manufacturing of maraging steel-H13 bimetals using laser powder bed fusion technique, Addit Manuf, 29, (2019); Torres-Alba A., Mercado-Colmenero J.M., Caballero-Garcia J.D.D., Martin-Donate C., A hybrid cooling model based on the use of newly designed fluted conformal cooling channels and fastcool inserts for green molds, Polymers, 13, 18, (2021); Torres-Alba A., Mercado-Colmenero J.M., Caballero-Garcia J.D.D., Martin-Donate C., Application of new triple hook-shaped conformal cooling channels for cores and sliders in injection molding to reduce residual stress and warping in complex plastic optical parts, Polymers, 13, 17, (2021); Godec D.M.M., .

A wide variety of current additive manufacturing techniques allow rapid prototyping and industrial production of different-sized products from various structural and functional materials. The structure and physical-mechanical properties of the metal products fabricated by electron-beam additive manufacturing (EBAM) within nonstationary metallurgy in a local molten pool often differ from those of the products fabricated by conventional metallurgy due to different crystallization mechanisms, sequence and completeness of phase transformations, and heterogeneous/homogeneous chemical composition of the resulting material. The possibility to control local metallurgical processes in the molten pool is the key advantage of the EBAM technology. It allows one to control the structure, composition, and properties of mono- and polymetallic, graded, composite and heat-resistant materials in order to obtain products with the desired chemical composition, macroscopic architecture, and microscopic structural parameters. As any new industrial technology, the EBAM method requires the development of scientifically based approaches to the choice of materials and production conditions. Here we provide an overview of the scientific approaches developed for electron-beam additive manufacturing of products from metals and alloys using wire or rods as a feedstock. The range of the studied materials includes additive materials based on copper, bronze, aluminum, nickel, titanium alloys, and different steels, as well as aluminum-based functionally graded materials and copper-based graded materials. The most important research findings are summarized. © 2022, The Author(s).","alloys; functionally graded materials; metals; polymetallic components; steels; wire-feed additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum; Copper; Electron beams; Electrons; Functional materials; Functionally graded materials; Nickel alloys; Titanium alloys; Chemical compositions; Electron-beam; Feed additives; Material-based; Metallics; Metals materials; Molten pool; Polymetallic; Polymetallic component; Wire-feed additive manufacturing; Wire","","","","","","","Ding D., Pan Z., Cuiuri D., Li H., Int.

In this work, experiments were carried out to study the effects of SLM on the microstructure and mechanical properties of 18Ni300 martensitic steel. With the increase in laser power, the grain size of the cladding layer decreases and the microstructure becomes dense. The side hardness is higher than upper surface hardness, and the tensile strength and elongation both increase first and then decrease. When the laser power is 300 W and the scanning speed is 1,000 mm/s, the comprehensive mechanical properties are the best, as the tensile strength, microhardness, elongation at break, and elongation after fracture are 1,217 MPa, 37.5%, 37.6%, and 8.93%, respectively. EBSD (Electron Backscatter Diffraction) shows that columnar crystals grow along the growth direction (z direction) in XOZ and YOZ planes, and the grains show weak texture. There are many small-angle grain boundaries, and the grain sizes are <10 μm.  © 2022 Yan Liang et al., published by Sciendo.","18Ni300; grain size; selective laser melting; temperature field","Elongation;

In this study, we designed four gradient lattice structures (GLSs) using the topology optimization method, including the unidirectional GLS, the bi-directional increasing GLS, the bi-directional decreasing GLS and the none-GLS. All GLSs were manufactureed by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). The uniaxial compression tests and finite element analysis were conducted to investigate the influence of gradient distribution features on deformation modes and energy absorption performance of GLSs. The results showed that, compared with the 45° shear fracture characteristic of the none-GLS, the unidirectional GLS, the bi-directional increasing GLS and the bi-directional decreasing GLS had the characteristics of the layer-by-layer fracture, showing considerably improved energy absorption capacity. The bi-directional increasing GLS showed a unique combination of shear fracture and layer-by-layer fracture, having the optimal energy absorption performance with energy absorption and specific energy absorption of 235.6 J and 9.5 J g−1 at 0.5 strain, respectively. Combined with the shape memory effect of NiTi alloy, multiple compression-heat recovery experiments were carried out to verify the shape memory function of LPBF-processed NiTi GLSs. These findings have potential value for the future design of GLSs and the realization of shape memory function of NiTi components through laser AM. © 2022 The Author(s).

This work aims, for the first time in the literature, to extend and enhance the performance of a commercial medical-grade resin for the VPP process, with the development of nanocomposites, using Copper (Cu) nanoparticles as the additive at two different concentrations. The addition of the Cu nanoparticles was expected to enhance the mechanical properties of the resin and to enable biocidal properties on the nanocomposites since Cu is known for its antibacterial performance. The effect of the Cu concentration was investigated. The nanocomposites were prepared with high-shear stirring. Specimens were 3D printed following international standards for mechanical testing. Their thermal and spectroscopic response was also investigated. The morphological characteristics were examined. The antibacterial performance was evaluated with an agar well diffusion screening process. The experimental results were analyzed with statistical modeling tools with two control parameters (three levels each) and eleven response parameters. Cu enhanced the mechanical properties in all cases studied. 0.5 wt.% Cu nanocomposite showed the highest improvement (approximately 11% in tensile and 10% in flexural strength). The antibacterial performance was sufficient against S. aureus and marginal against E. coli. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing (AM); amicrobial; copper (Cu); Escherichia coli (E. coli); medical grade; resin; Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus); vat photopolymerization","copper nanoparticle; drug additive; nanocomposite; resin; agar diffusion; agar dilution; antibacterial activity; Article; controlled study; disk diffusion; drug manufacture; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Escherichia coli; flexural strength; mechanical test; morphological trait; nonhuman; photoluminescence; polymerization; Raman spectrometry; response surface method; scanning electron microscopy; tensile strength; thermal analysis; thermogravimetry; three dimensional printing; zone of inhibition","","","JSM-IT700HR, Jeol, Japan; LabRAM HR, Horiba, Japan; OZR5","Horiba, Japan; Jeol, Japan","","","Saini J.S., Dowling L., Kennedy J., Trimble D., Investigations of the mechanical properties on different print orientations in SLA 3D printed resin, Proc.

Despite continued advances, MAM processes still face huge uncertainty, resulting in variable part quality. Real-time sensing for MAM processing helps quantify uncertainty by detecting build failure and process anomalies. While the high volume of multidimensional sensor data—such as melt-pool geometries and temperature gradients—is beginning to be explored, sensor selection does not yet effectively link sensor data to part quality. To begin investigating such connections, we propose network-based models that capture in real-time (1) sensor data’s association with process variables and (2) as-built part qualities’ association with related physical phenomena. These sensor models and networks lay the foundation for a comprehensive framework to monitor and manage the quality of MAM process outcomes. © 2022 ASME.","artificial intelligence; big data and analytics; computational foundations for additive manufacturing; cyber manufacturing; data-driven engineering; engineering informatics; knowledge engineering; process modeling for engineering applications; qualification; validation of computational models; verification","3D printers; Additives; Information management; Knowledge engineering; Quality management; Big data and analytic; Computational foundation for additive manufacturing; Computational modelling; Cybe manufacturing; Data driven; Data-driven engineering; Engineering applications; Engineering informatics; Process modeling for engineering application; Process-models; Qualification; Validation of computational model; Big data","","","","","","","Seifi M., Salem A., Beuth J., Harrysson O., Lewandowski J.

The AlCoCrFeNi2.1 EHEA printed by SLM has face-centered cubic (FCC) and body-centered cubic (BCC)/B2 phases, and the FCC phase accumulates at the boundary of the molten pool. With the increase in volumetric energy density (VED), the content of the FCC phase parallel to the surface in the direction of the building increases from 30.9% to 41%. The X–Z plane mainly produces columnar crystals along the temperature gradient, while a large number of equiaxed crystals are produced in the X–Y direction. When the volume energy density is 157 kJ/mol (VED 157), the average grain size is 1.33 µm for BCC and 1.14 µm for FCC, which is significantly smaller than other preparation methods. Due to defect distribution and size, the microhardness of the X–Y plane is generally higher than that of the X–Z plane, with maximum hardnesses of 660 HV and 655 HV, respectively, which is much higher than those of traditionally manufactured counterparts. The compression performance of SLM process AlCoCrFeNi2.1 EHEAs shows maximum yield strength of 1567 MPa, and the ultimate compressive strength can reach 3276 MPa. © 2022","Anisotropy; High-entropy alloys; Metallurgical defects; Microstructure evolution; Selective laser melting","Aluminum alloys; Anisotropy; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Compressive strength; Entropy; Eutectics; Iron alloys; Melting; Selective laser melting; Textures; Body-centred cubic; Face-centered cubic phasis; Face-centred cubic; High entropy alloys; Metallurgical defects; Microstructure and properties; Microstructure evolutions; Microstructure performance; Selective laser melting; Volumetric energy densities; High-entropy alloys","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51775366, 52075360, 52105389); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was financially supported by theNational Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51775366, 52075360, and 52105389).","Yeh J.W., Chen S.K., Lin S.J., Gan J.Y., Chin T.S., Shun T.T., Tsau C.H., Chang S.Y., Adv.

A common notion in this field is “complexity for free”, which acknowledges both the reduced cost per part in extremely challenging designs and the possibility of manufacturing geometries that would be impossible to obtain via conventional means. However, even for Laser Powder Bed Fusion or LPBF, the most widely used technology for metals, several limits still remain to what can be printed, such as downfacing surfaces which usually have increased surface roughness and reduced dimensional accuracy due to local overheating and warpage. In this work, a new type of support that does not touch the printed part was developed and validated. This contactless support creates a thin powder gap that provides thermal conduction and stabilizes the liquid melt pool. To prove the benefits of this new technique an impeller case was printed both with conventional and contactless supports while the processing time and surface roughness of the two were compared, confirming the significant increase in productivity and better quality due to the new strategy. © 2022","Contactless supports; Laser Powder Bed Fusion; Metals; Productivity; Surface quality","","","","","","","","Xiang Z., Wang L., Yang C., Yin M., Yin G., Analysis of the quality of slope surface in selective laser melting process by simulation and experiments, Optik, 176, pp. 68-77, (2019); Fox J.C., Moylan S.P., Lane B.M., Effect of process parameters on the surface roughness of overhanging structures in Laser Powder Bed Fusion additive manufacturing, Procedia CIRP, 45, pp. 131-134, (2016); Snyder J.C., Stimpson C.K., Thole K.A., Mongillo D.J., Build direction effects on microchannel tolerance and surface roughness, J.

Two methodologies were followed: at 35 and 45 °C, under temperature control alone (ASTM F1980), and under controlled cycles of temperature, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and humidity (ASTM G154). Weathered samples were characterized by color visual analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). For weathering tests at 35 °C, and simultaneous control of temperature, radiation, and humidity (T-R-H), the degradation seemed to predominantly affect amorphous parts of the PLA scaffolds. For weathering at 45 °C, the degradation was prevalent on amorphous parts for initial exposure and, subsequently, also affected crystalline parts of the polymer. The accelerated weathering tests produced changes in the FTIR spectra, indicating intensified chain scissions by photolysis and hydrolysis, with more pronounced effects for the T-R-H test, followed by the tests under 45 °C and 35 °C. Noticeable surface defects appeared only on PLA samples subjected to the T-R-H test (336 h exposure), as a result of the more severe degradation generated by the combined variables of this accelerated weathering. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3D printing; Accelerated weathering; PLA; Scaffold","3D printers; Crystalline materials; Differential scanning calorimetry; Humidity control; Photolysis; Scaffolds; Scaffolds (biology); Scanning electron microscopy; Surface defects; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Accelerated weathering; Humidity tests; PLA; Property; Radiation tests; Temperature radiation; Temperature test; Temperature/ humidities; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy","","","","","LabMat; Materials Laboratory; SENAI Technology Institute of Criciúma; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa e Inovação do Estado de Santa Catarina, FAPESC; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, UFSC","This work was supported by the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) and the Foundation for Research and Innovation of the State of Santa Catarina (FAPESC).

Then the Ni@Al2O3 reinforced CoCrMo alloy were manufactured by selective laser melting (SLM) process. The microstructure, mechanical property and wear resistance performance of the CoCrMo alloy were characterized. By increasing the content of Ni@Al2O3 particles from 0 wt% to 1.0 wt%, the CoCrMo alloy kept flawless with the highest hardness of 435 HV1 and best abrasion performance, which could be attributed to the pinning dislocation slip effect of Al2O3 phase and the metallurgical bonding of Ni phase with CoCrMo alloy during the SLM process. When the content of Ni@Al2O3 increased to 2 wt%, the inconsistent fluidity between Ni@Al2O3 and CoCrMo powders has led to the uneven distribution of mixed particles during the powder spreading process, which resulted in the lowest compressive strength and wear resistance. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","CoCrMo alloy; Electroless plating; Ni@Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>; SLM; Wear resistance","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Compressive strength; Electroless plating; Melting; Nickel alloys; Selective laser melting; Ternary alloys; Wear of materials; Alloy powder; Ball-milled; CoCrMo alloy; Laser melting process; Microstructure mechanical properties; Ni@al2O3; Nickel coated; Performance; Property; Selective laser melting; Wear resistance","","","","","Graduate Education Innovation Program of Shanxi Province, (2020SY353); Opening Project of Shanxi Key Laboratory of Controlled Metal Solidification and Precision Manufacturing; Special Project for Scientific and Technology Cooperation and Exchange of Shanxi Province, (202104041101010); Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province, (201901D111168); Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province; North University of China, NUC, (MSPM201903); North University of China, NUC","Our research work presented in this article is supported by Special Project for Scientific and Technology Cooperation and Exchange of Shanxi Province (No. 202104041101010 ), Graduate Education Innovation Program of Shanxi Province (No. 2020SY353 ), Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province (No. 201901D111168 ) and Opening Project of Shanxi Key Laboratory of Controlled Metal Solidification and Precision Manufacturing, North University of China (No. MSPM201903 ).

It is used to form complex components of Ti, Fe, or Ni alloys. However, for nonferrous alloys—aluminum, magnesium, copper—additive technologies are not used because of rapid melting during laser, electron beam, and/or arc treatment. Cold spraying is widely used as an effective technology for applying high quality coatings in the mass production of metal and alloy products and/or metal matrix composite coatings. In addition, cold spraying is a serious and effective tool for the additive manufacturing of metals, and research in this area is currently becoming intense. It is shown in the work that the use of cold spraying technology makes it possible to obtain composite materials based on aluminum and titanium reinforced with boron carbide. Zirconium dioxide chosen as the reinforcing component could not be introduced into the composite based on aluminum and nickel, which is most likely due to the large particle size. During thermal treatment of materials obtained by cold spraying, new chemical compounds are formed—both intermetallic compounds and hardening ceramic inclusions that increase the microhardness. At the same time, the microhardness increases by about 7 times, but the linear dimensions decrease, which is not observed in the system based on nickel aluminide. However, as a result of a change in the structure during chemical transformations, a change in the geometry of the product and the formation of pores can be observed. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","additive technology; cold gas-dynamic spraying; intermetallic compounds; microhardness; X-ray phase analysis","3D printers; Additives; Gas dynamics; Industrial research; Metallic matrix composites; Metals; Microhardness; Nickel alloys; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Powder metals; Titanium alloys; Titanium carbide; Zirconia; Additive technology; Cold gas dynamic spraying; Cold spraying; Intermetallics compounds; Material-based; Metal additives; Nickel aluminides; Nickel-Titanium; Titanium aluminides; X-ray phase analysis; Intermetallics","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (21-73-30019)","This work was carried out within the framework of the Russian Science Foundation (RSF), project no. 21-73-30019.

For this study, a dual-phase (DP) steel was chosen because of its combination of high strength and ductility. Its microstructure typically consists of two phases: islands of hard martensite and a soft ferrite matrix. Currently, DP steels are used in various automotive components that are pro-duced by conventional manufacturing methods. The mechanical properties of laser-beam powder-bed-fusion (PBF-LB) test speci-mens have been evaluated including their heat-treated properties, to show the range of properties that can be developed with a single alloy system. This approach provides greater flexibility to the end user by allowing one material to be utilized in a range of applications. Microstructures and porosity are evaluated for gas-atom-ized powder and discussed in relation to the build parameters and the mechanical properties. © 2022, American Powder Metallurgy Institute.

Under different process conditions, the melting modes in LPBF are different, which induces the difference in laser absorptivity. An empirical model of absorptivity was used to calculate the laser absorptivity under various process conditions. An analytical point-moving heat source model was employed to calculate the temperature distribution of the build-in LPBF, with absorptivity, material properties, and process conditions as inputs. The molten pool width, length, and depth were determined by comparing the predicted temperature profile with the melting temperature of the material. To validate the proposed method, the predicted molten pool width, and depth of Ti6Al4V were compared with the reported experimental measurements under various process conditions. The predicted molten pool widths were very close to the measured results, and the predictions of molten pool depth were also acceptable. The computational time of the presented model is less than 200s, which shows better computational efficiency than most methods based on numerical iterations, such as the finite element method (FEM). The sensitivity of molten pool width and depth to normalized enthalpy w also discussed. The presented analytical method can be a potential tool for the research of molten pool size and related defects in LPBF. © 2022 by the authors.","analytical thermal model; high computational efficiency; laser absorptivity; molten pool dimensions; powder bed fusion","","","","","","","","Cunningham R., Zhao C., Parab N., Kantzos C., Pauza J., Fezzaa K., Sun T., Rollett A.D., Keyhole threshold and morphology in laser melting revealed by ultrahigh-speed x-ray imaging, Science, 363, pp. 849-852, (2019); Jandaghi M.R., Saboori A., Iuliano L., Pavese M., On the effect of rapid annealing on the microstructure and mechanical behavior of additively manufactured stainless steel by Laser Powder Bed Fusion, Mater.

In addition, additive manufacturing (AM) is an effective manufacturing process for a high degree of control over geometry. Microstructure evolution during additive manufacturing should be importantly considered because it is closely related to the formation of defects, mechanical properties, and conditions of post-heat treatments. This study investigated the microstructure evolution of carbon-bearing martensitic steel during laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) to identify the effect of rapid solidification, solid-state transformation, and in-situ heat treatments on the formation of the as-built microstructure. As a result of investigation of a reconstructed prior austenite map by the Kurdjumov-Sachs orientation relationship, it was confirmed that the austenite is generated mainly at the columnar, martensite block, and lath boundaries. A Scheil-Gulliver model represented that carbon and molybdenum are segregated to the columnar boundary, and this could be the main reason why austenite showed high fraction at room temperature. The carbon concentration in the austenite is much higher than that of the martensite interior, which is significantly caused by carbon partitioning derived by repeated laser scanning. A constrained carbon equilibrium model was used to estimate the final fraction of austenite, and the results showed that the characteristics of the as-built microstructure can be reasonably estimated. The microstructural evolution mechanism introduced here is expected to allow successful LPBF of carbon-bearing martensitic steels. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon-bearing martensitic steel; In-situ quenching-partitioning; Laser powder bed fusion; Microstructure evolution; Segregation","3D printers; Additives; Austenite; Bearings (machine parts); Martensite; Martensitic transformations; Microstructure; Quenching; Rapid solidification; Austenite formation; Carbon bearing; Carbon-bearing martensitic steel; In-situ quenching-partitioning; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Laser scanning; Microstructure evolutions; Powder bed; Segregation; Martensitic stainless steel","","","","","Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE, (P0002007); Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology, KIAT","This study was supported by Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology (KIAT) grant funded by the Korea Government ( MOTIE ) ( P0002007 , The Competency Development Program for Industry Specialist).

However, research on continuous fibre-reinforced composites produced by Vat photopolymerisation is severely lacking. This paper proposed a new 3D printing process, called continuous fibre reinforced Vat photopolymerisation (CONFIB-VAT). Plain and fibre-reinforced tensile specimens were produced and systematically tested. The results showed that the mechanical properties were not affected by the printing direction. The influence of fibre volume fraction on CONFIB-VAT composites was also studied. A 10 % fibre volume content embedment resulted in more than a 500 % increase in ultimate tensile strength. For the first time, this study studied the effects of fibre angle placement and the shadow under fibre shielding during UV curing, resulting in incomplete curing. The use of post-curing to overcome the shadow problem was investigated and considerably improved mechanical property. Additionally, simultaneous fibre embedding in the XY and Z planes was achieved, which allowed for greater flexibility in fibre arrangement and composite design. Overall, this research establishes a robust platform for Vat photopolymerisation based composite printing with virtually no restrictions on the materials and fibres printed. CONFIB-VAT significantly expands the material palette for emerging technologies and provides guidance for the design of structural 3D printed composite components and will aid in the development of commercial Vat photopolymerisation composite 3D printing machines. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive Manufacturing; Continuous fibre-reinforced composites; Vat photopolymerisation","Additives; Curing; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Photopolymerization; Tensile strength; 3D printing process; Additive manufacture; Continuous fiber-reinforced composite; Continuous fibers; Fibre-reinforced; Fibre-reinforced composite; Photo polymerization; Technological advancement; Tensile specimens; Vat photopolymerization; 3D printers","","","","","Innovative Platform and Talents Program of Hunan Province, (2019RS1019)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the Innovative Platform and Talents Program of Hunan Province ( 2019RS1019 ).","Rajesh P., Delaroa C., Gagne M., Klemberg-Sapieha J., Sirois F., Therriault D., Continuous and selective-area coating of silver on fiber-reinforced polymer composites for aerospace applications, Mater.

In this study, we demonstrated that adding aluminum (Al) powder by as little as 0.75, 1.5, and 3 wt.% substantially enhances Cu processability, leading to denser (up to 98%) and smoother (Ra = 3.3 μm) Cu-Al parts as compared to 95% and 18 μm, respectively, for the parts printed using pure Cu. In addition, this method reduces the ED required by a factor of two for the additive manufacturing of the Cu-based parts while maintaining a significant heat dissipation. These improvements are achieved due to the coexistence of solid Cu particles with liquid Al at the vicinity of the molten pool, accomodating the predensification of the powder mixture. The development of the semi-liquid 3D printing approach opens up a new path to easily manufacture materials difficult to be printed for broadening their applications. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Aluminum; Copper; Selective laser melting","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1826392, 1542182)","","Pal S., Drstvensek I., Physical behaviors of materials in selective laser melting process, DAAAM International Scientific Book, pp. 239-256, (2018); Prashanth K.G., Selective laser melting: materials and applications, J.

Today’s scientists or engineers look to nature for an optimal, economically viable, long-term solution. Similarly, a proposal is made in this current work to use seven different bio-inspired structures for automotive impact resistance. All seven of these structures are derived from plant and animal species and are intended to be tested for compressive loading to achieve load-bearing capacity. The work may even cater to optimisation techniques to solve the real-time problem using algorithm-based generative shape designs built using CATIA V6 in unit dimension. The samples were optimised with Rhino 7 software and then simulated with ANSYS workbench. To carry out the comparative study, an experimental work of bioprinting in fused deposition modelling (3D printing) was carried out. The goal is to compare the results across all formats and choose the best-performing concept. The results were obtained for compressive load, flexural load, and fatigue load conditions, particularly the number of life cycles, safety factor, damage tolerance, and bi-axiality indicator. When compared to previous research, the results are in good agreement. Because of their multifunctional properties combining soft and high stiffness and lightweight properties of novel materials, novel materials have many potential applications in the medical, aerospace, and automotive sectors. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; mechanical property improvements; nature-inspired architectures; Rhino 7","","","","","","Dassault Systèmes La Fondation; Dassault System Foundation, (IN-2021-2-02); UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (105893); UK Research and Innovation, UKRI","Funding text 1: This research received external funding from La Fondation Dassault Syst\u00E8mes.

To the best knowledge of the authors, studies on the torsional behavior of 3D-printed polymers are limited. Fifteen different materials were 3D-printed using the fused deposition modeling (FDM) approach in a flat orientation. For each series, two raster angles i.e., ±45° and 0°/90° degrees were considered. Circular specimens with a diameter of 10 mm were subjected to a torsional moment with a rate of 0.2 mm/min. Results showed superior performance of specimens with a raster angle of ±45° in comparison to their 0°/ 90° counterparts. Besides, shear moduli and linear energy absorption per unit volume of the specimens were compared and discussed. Specimen PAHT-CF (polyamide high temperature; CF: carbon fiber) (average shear stress: 49.3 MPa) had the overall best performance in all the investigated parameters; failure of specimens except for polypropylene (PPJET), and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) was brittle and sudden and initiated between layers rather than inside layers (i.e., filament fracture); incorporation of carbon fiber didn't necessarily contribute to improved torsional capacity or ductility. Finally, idealized multi-linear curves were proposed which can aid in the numerical simulation of various 3D-printed polymers. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D-printed polymer; Fracture; Fused deposition modeling (FDM); Monotonic torsion; Raster angle","Deposition; Fracture; Fused Deposition Modeling; Layered manufacturing; Polypropylenes; Shear stress; Torsional stress; 3d-printed polymer; Fused deposition modeling; Linear energy; Modeling approach; Monotonic torsion; Per unit volume; Performance; Raster angle; Torsional behaviors; Torsional moment; Carbon fibers","","","","","","","Kaushik V., Kumar B.N., Kumar S.S., Vignesh M., Magnesium role in additive manufacturing of biomedical implants–challenges and opportunities, Addit.

Material and methods: PMMA CAD/CAM provisional material (Vita Temp/Vita) served as Control. Four 3DRs (Cosmos-SLA/Yller, Cosmos-DLP/Yller, PriZma-Bioprov/Makertech, Nanolab/Wilcos) were used in three printing orientations (0°, 45°, and 90°). Printed samples were cleaned with isopropyl alcohol prior to post-curing in specific post-curing units. For each group, 20 bar-shaped samples (25 × 2x2 mm) and ten disc-shaped samples (15-mm diameter, 2.5-mm thick) were obtained. The dimensions of bar samples were measured and the mean percent errors were compared to the reference (digital) values to obtain “accuracy” (n = 20). Samples were then aged in distilled water at 37 °C and half were submitted to a three-point bend test in a universal testing machine after 24 h and the other half after 1 year (n = 10). Disc samples were polished prior to microhardness evaluation (n = 10). Microstructure and elemental composition of filler particles in the 3DRs were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (n = 3). Accuracy and microhardness were submitted to two way-, and FM and FS to three way-ANOVA, followed by Tukey's tests. Results of experimental groups were compared to a milled PMMA Control using Dunnett's tests, and Student's t-tests compared FM and FS to Control at different aging periods (α = 0.05). Results: Except for Cosmos-DLP, the 90° orientation demonstrated the best overall accuracy in all dimensions evaluated. The overall accuracy of Cosmos-SLA was not significantly different from Control and higher than other 3DRs. The FM of all 3DRs was lower than Control, regardless of orientation and aging period. After 1 year of aging, FS of 45°-Cosmos-SLA and all orientations of PriZma were not different from Control, while 90°-Cosmos-SLA was higher. Build orientation had no influence on microhardness of the 3DRs: Nanolab was the only resin harder than Control. Very few nanometric spherical filler particles were found in Cosmos-SLA, Cosmos-DLP, and PriZma, while Nanolab presented higher number of particles having irregular shapes and sizes. Conclusions: In general, although build orientation did not influence microhardness results, the 90° -orientation resulted in the best overall accuracy for most 3DRs. After 1-year water storage, Cosmos-SLA printed vertically showed the highest FS, while the PMMA Control obtained the highest FM for both aging periods. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Dimensional measurement accuracy; Flexural strength; Hardness; Interim dental prostheses; Three-dimensional printing","Flexural Strength; Materials Testing; Polymethyl Methacrylate; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Surface Properties; Water; 3D printers; Bending strength; Computer aided design; Curing; Dental composites; Dental prostheses; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Filling; Frequency modulation; Microhardness; Scanning electron microscopy; Testing; filler; poly(methyl methacrylate); resin; poly(methyl methacrylate); water; Build orientation; Dimensional measurement accuracy; Dimensional measurements; Filler particles; Flexural modulus; Interim dental prosthesis; Measurement accuracy; Overall accuracies; Post-curing; Three-dimensional-printing; Article; biomechanics; computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing; controlled study; dental restoration; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; flexural strength; measurement accuracy; measurement error; microhardness; particle size; scanning electron microscopy; three dimensional printing; materials testing; surface property; three dimensional printing; Resins","","poly(methyl methacrylate), 39320-98-4, 9008-29-1; water, 7732-18-5; Polymethyl Methacrylate, ; Water, ","CAD-Temp shade 1M2T, VITA Zahnfabrik, Germany; CAM 5-S1; Cosmos Temp-DLP shade A1; Cosmos Temp-SLA shade B1; Flash Forge Hunter; FormLabs 2, Formlabs, United States; Nanolab 3D shade A1; Otoflash G171; P30, Straumann, Switzerland; Photo Flash Maxx; PriZma BioProv shade A1; Vision Beta Vario, 3M, United States; W3D; Wash and Cure","3M, United States; Formlabs, United States; Straumann, Switzerland; VITA Zahnfabrik, Germany","College of Agriculture; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2020/05610-5); Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP; Universidade de São Paulo, USP","Funding text 1: We would like to thank Fábio M.

It has been used to model powder melting, rapid solidification, and grain structure evolution in metal additive manufacturing (AM). However, traditional direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the PF method is computationally expensive due to sufficiently small mesh size. Here, a physics-embedded graph network (PEGN) is proposed to leverage an elegant graph representation of the grain structure and embed the classic PF theory into the graph network. By reformulating the classic PF problem as an unsupervised machine learning task on a graph network, PEGN efficiently solves temperature field, liquid/solid phase fraction, and grain orientation variables to minimize a physics-based loss/energy function. The approach is at least 50 times faster than DNS in both CPU and GPU implementation while still capturing key physical features. Hence, PEGN allows to simulate large-scale multi-layer and multi-track AM build effectively. © 2022, The Author(s).","","3D printers; Additives; Computation theory; Grain size and shape; Morphology; Rapid solidification; Topology; Computational approach; Direct-numerical-simulation; Embedded graphs; Graph networks; Interfacial morphologies; Microstructure evolutions; Phase field methods; Phase-field simulation; Physics-based; Powder melting; Numerical methods","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1934367, 1934367); Department of Defense Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, (N00014-19-1-2642); Center for Hierarchical Materials Design, CHiMaD, (70NANB19H005)","This work was funded by the Department of Defense Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, USA N00014-19-1-2642, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) - Center for Hierarchical Material Design (CHiMaD) under grant No. 70NANB19H005, and National Science Foundation (NSF) through grants CMMI-1934367.

The microstructures indicated that an alternately fine and coarse grain could be found in the Top plane and Side plane. The Top plane was mostly dominated by fine grains, while the microstructure in the Side plane primarily consisted of columnar grains. The XRD and TEM results suggested a great deal of nano-size Al3(Sc, Zr) precipitations were formed in the Top and Side plane. Moreover, the results from the EBSD demonstrated that the texture of the Top plane was closed to {001}〈100〉 but very weak, while the Side plane orientated slightly {011}〈122〉 texture. The electrochemical tests showed that the Top plane exhibited a better corrosion resistance compared with the Side plane. The lower corrosion susceptibility of the Top was mainly attributed to the better grain distribution and weaker texture relative to the Side plane. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","AlMgScZr alloy;

Thus, the determination of melt pool dimensions and resulting printability, given a set of process parameters, is crucial to understanding the performance of AM parts. Unfortunately, experiments relating process parameters to the melt pool have a high execution and data collection cost. On the other hand, simulations do not suffer this cost penalty but can never be as good as the ground truth experiments. A number of capabilities exist to predict melt pool geometry from process parameters that range from highly accurate codes with long simulation times to less accurate analytical solutions that are nearly instantaneous. This work leverages multifidelity Gaussian process (GP) surrogates to examine how the fusion of information from different fidelities, including experiments, influences the resulting predictive model. Both a multifidelity GP regression and a novel multifidelity GP classification are examined. The multifidelity models are compared to standard GPs and a withheld set of test data. The results show good predictive accuracy for the melt pool width and depth, but suggest multifidelity models may not significantly improve classification of printability. © 2022, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Melt pool prediction; Metal additive manufacturing; Printability; Surrogate modeling","3D printers; Additives; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Lakes; Gaussian Processes; Melt pool; Melt pool prediction; Metal additive manufacturing; Metal additives; Multi fidelities; Multi-fidelity models; Printability; Process parameters; Surrogate modeling; Forecasting","","","","","NRL Edison Graduate Memorial Training Program; Office of Naval Research, ONR; U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, NRL","RS, AR, AB, AI, and JM acknowledge partial support for this work by the Office of Naval Research through the Naval Research Laboratory’s (NRL) core funding.

In this paper, multi-rotation structure(MRS) and single rotation structure (SRS) are designed based on the microstructure of grass stem cross-section. Selective laser melting (SLM) is used to fabricate the structural model. The mechanical properties of two structures are investigated by numerical simulations and experiments. Results show that the specific absorption energy (SEA) of MRS is 33% higher than SRS. In addition, MRS is tested with cyclic compression and shape recovery experiments, which show the deformation recovery rate of MRS is 96%. Based on the superiority of MRS in mechanical and recovery performance, this paper also analyzes the influence of cell thickness t and cell angleθ on the performance. It is found that the sample with t = 0.45 mm, θ = 60° has the best comprehensive performance. Compared to SRS and initial design structure of MRS, its SEA is improved by 129% and 72.2%, and mean crushing force (MCF) is increased by 330% and 74%. This provides a theoretical basis for the development of new bionic protective structures. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Bionic protective structures; NiTi alloy; Numerical simulation; Parameter influence; Quasi-static compression","Additives; Binary alloys; Biomechanics; Bionics; Numerical models; Recovery; Selective laser melting; Shape optimization; Titanium alloys; Bionic protective structure; Bionic structures; Mechanical analysis; NiTi alloys; Parameter influences; Protective structures; Quasi-static compression; Single rotations; Specific absorption; Structure-based; Molecular biology","","","","","Interdisciplinary Cultivation Project for Young Teachers and Students, (415010300078); Interdisciplinary Research Fund for Doctoral Postgraduates of Jilin University, (101832020DJX052); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51975246); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Changchun University of Science and Technology, CUST, (CMNM-KF202109); Changchun University of Science and Technology, CUST; Jilin Scientific and Technological Development Program, (202013, YDZJ202101ZYTS134); Jilin Scientific and Technological Development Program; Program for Jilin University Science and Technology Innovative Research Team, (2019TD-34); Program for Jilin University Science and Technology Innovative Research Team","This research is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51975246 ), Science and Technology Development Program of Jilin Province ( YDZJ202101ZYTS134 ), the Ascl-zytsxm ( 202013 ), the Open Project Program of Key Laboratory for Cross-Scale Micro and Nano Manufacturing, Minstry of Education, Changchun University of Science and Technology ( CMNM-KF202109 ), the Program for JLU Science and Technology Innovative Research Team (No. 2019TD-34 ), the Interdisciplinary Research Fund for Doctoral Postgraduates of Jilin University (No. 101832020DJX052 ) and the Interdisciplinary Cultivation Project for Young Teachers and Students (No. 415010300078 ).

Single-tracks experiment indicated that when significant depth (dint) of the molten pool overlap area was greater than 68.49 μm and a high-quality morphology of the molten pool was formed, fully dense SLM-ed samples can be obtained. The tensile strength and elongation of SLM-ed samples fabricated at different process parameters were in the range of 940–985 MPa and 9.5–17.3%, respectively. When the laser beam power, scan speed and hatch spacing were 175 W, 600 mm/s, and 0.09 mm, respectively, the samples exhibited the highest mechanical properties with a tensile strength of 985.4 MPa and an elongation of 17.3%, which exceeded the ASTM B265-15 Ti-6Al-4V alloy level. The outcomes of this work have facilitated in developing titanium parts using low-cost modified HDH-Ti powder, and have also opened many dimensions for future investigations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Ball milling; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Near-spherical powders; Single-tracks","Aluminum alloys; Fabrication; Laser beams; Melting; Morphology; Powders; Selective laser melting; Tensile strength; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Ball-milled; Milled powders; Molten pool; Near-spherical powder; Physical and mechanical properties; Process parameters; Processing parameters; Selective laser melting; Single-tracks; Spherical powders; Ball milling","","","","","Postdoctor Research Foundation of Shunde Graduate School of University of Science and Technology Beijing, (2022BH001); State Key Lab of Advanced Metals and Materials; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51874037, 51922004); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2021M700377); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (2212035); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality; University of Science and Technology Beijing, USTB, (2020Z-04, 2021Z-03, 2022Z-12, FRF-IDRY-20-023); University of Science and Technology Beijing, USTB; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (06500236, FRF-TP-19005C1Z); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2021A1515110548); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","This research work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51922004, 51874037), State Key Lab of Advanced Metals and Materials, University of Science and Technology Beijing (2020Z-04, 2021Z-03, 2022Z-12), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (FRF-TP-19005C1Z, 06500236), Interdisciplinary Research Project for Young Teachers of USTB (Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, FRF-IDRY-20-023), Postdoctor Research Foundation of Shunde Graduate School of University of Science and Technology Beijing (2022BH001), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2021M700377), Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2021A1515110548) and the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (2212035).","Fang Z.Z., Paramore J.D., Sun P., Chandran K.S.R., Zhang Y., Xia Y., Cao F., Koopman M., Free M., Powder metallurgy of titanium-past, present, and future, Int.

This work proposes a thermal process to enhance the strength of the interlayer adhesion of 3D printed PEI thermoplastic materials. The annealing process was determined as a suitable post-processing procedure and was the focus of this work. Annealing was carried out in an oven at temperatures of 220, 225, 230, and 235 °C; it was determined that annealing performed at 225 °C in particular was highly desirable in terms of enhancing interlayer adhesion strength. In this work, characterization (FTIR, XRD, and SEM) and mechanical (tensile, bending, and hardness) analyses of 3D printed PEI were performed to better understand the strength of interlayer adhesion and overcome a mechanical performance limitation of this material. According to the tensile, bending, and hardness test results, the greatest improvements were found as increase of 10, 5, and 12%, respectively. © 2022, ASM International.","3D printing; annealing; crystallinity; interlayer tensile strength; PEI; rheology","3D printers; Adhesion; Annealing; Bond strength (materials); Crystallinity; Hardness; Melt spinning; Reinforced plastics; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Cristallinity; Interlayer adhesion; Interlayer tensile strength; Mechanical; Mechanical performance; Rheology; Thermal-annealing; Thermoplastic materials; Tensile strength","","","","","Ulug Bey High Technology Application and Research Centre; ULUTEM; Scientific Research Projects Unit; Gaziantep Üniversitesi, (RM.16.01); Gaziantep Üniversitesi","This work was supported by the Scientific Research Projects Unit (BAPYB) of Gaziantep University (Project numbers: RM.16.01).

This could be utilized in, e.g., the design of new types of heat exchangers in ferritic stainless steels often used for high-temperature applications. Ferritic stainless steels are, however, difficult to weld and could therefore imply obstacles when produced by AM. When establishing the AM-produced alloy in new applications, it is therefore important to increase the understanding of the mechanical properties and high-temperature creep resistance in relation to the unique microstructure and printability. In this study, we have investigated the microstructure of Cr-rich SS446 ferritic stainless steel produced by L-PBF by microscopical and crystallographic techniques. The properties were compared to the conventionally produced tubes. The rapid cooling and reheating during the application of the subsequent powder layers during L-PBF introduces an intriguing microstructure consisting of a ferritic matrix with precipitation of austenite showing a Kurdjumov–Sachs orientation relationship. Characteristic dislocation networks were observed in the L-PBF samples and contributed to the good mechanical properties in the as-built state (more than twice the yield strength of the conventionally produced tube). Furthermore, the creep resistance at 800 °C was superior to the conventionally produced component, suggesting that L-PBF-produced SS446 possesses many advantages regarding production as compared to the conventional route. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; ferritic stainless steel; laser powder bed fusion; solidification; SS446; thermodynamic calculations","","","","","","Stiftelsen för Strategisk Forskning, SSF, (GMT14-0048); Stiftelsen för Strategisk Forskning, SSF; Vetenskapsrådet, VR, (2019-00645); Vetenskapsrådet, VR","Funding text 1: Financial support from the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research, project \u201CSSF-Development of processes and Materials in AM\u201D, reference No. GMT14-0048, is greatly acknowledged.

This research utilises a systematic experimental approach to develop and optimise an L-PBF process for manufacturing Ni-Mn-Ga lattices. Experiments were conducted in two distinctive stages: firstly, to characterise the selective Mn evaporation in bulk samples built; secondly, to investigate the influence of the applied process parameters on the relative density and geometrical integrity of the lattice struts. The lattices manufactured using optimised parameters had a high internal density of ∼99% and were heat-treated for chemical homogenisation, grain growth, and atomic ordering. The heat-treated lattices exhibited a seven-layered modulated (14 M) martensite structure at ambient temperature with the phase transformation temperatures and magnetic properties corresponding to the chemical composition. Primarily, the results demonstrate that the beneficial ‘bamboo-grained’ structure can be obtained in individual lattice struts via post-process heat treatment. Plus, they also confirm that the use of thinned-down structures, such as lattices, can effectively prevent the cracking previously observed in bulk samples. Although there remains plenty of room for further research on this topic, these results highlight the high potential of L-PBF for the manufacture of a new generation of MSM-based actuating devices. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","4D printing; Additive manufacturing; Laser powder bed fusion; Lattice structures; Magnetic shape memory materials","Additives; Gallium alloys; Grain growth; Industrial research; Magnetism; Manganese alloys; Nickel alloys; Polycrystalline materials; Shape-memory alloy; Struts; Ternary alloys; 4d printing; Bulk samples; Fusion process; High potential; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Lattice structures; Magnetic shape memory materials; Ni-Mn-Ga; Powder bed; 3D printers","","","","","AMBI; Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT; Strategic Research Council of Finland, (313349); Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Dstl; Academy of Finland, AKA, (325910); Academy of Finland, AKA","This work was financially supported by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), the Strategic Research Council of Finland (grant number 313349 ), the Academy of Finland (grant number 325910 ), and the AMBI (Analytics-based Management for Business and Manufacturing Industry) research platform of Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT .","Ullakko K., Huang J.K., Kantner C., O'Handley R.C., Kokorin V.V., Large magnetic-field-induced strains in Ni2MnGa single crystals, Appl.

Prof. Francisco Degni, SP, Araraquara, 14800-900, Brazil","Process modeling is an important tool in additive manufacturing (AM) because it elucidates the relationship between processing parameters and material properties. Ultraviolet laser scanning vat-photopolymerization (VPP-UVL) is a common additive manufacturing technique, with a strong physical modeling based on the Jacobs work curve framework. The work curve model was developed for continuous UV exposure (CE) systems, however most VPP-UVL systems to date operate under intermittent exposure (IE) conditions due to the wide adoption of solid-state pulsed-laser sources. Despite their fundamental differences, the Jacobs work curve model is still successfully employed in IE systems under high overlap conditions between pulses, however there are few investigations regarding the limiting conditions for the applicability of the Jacobs work curve model to describe the total exposure profile in intermittent exposure (IE) setups. To address this issue, a model describing a VPP-UVL-IE process was developed. The VPP-UVL-IE model presented here has the same logarithmic dependence as the Jacobs work curve model, but with the addition of a multiplying factor carrying information on the spatial distribution of energy, that is, the overlap of individual pulses. The model is adaptable for non-gaussian beam profiles and can be solved for bidimensional analysis representing layer fabrication. To test the model, a custom-built VPP-UVL-IE additive manufacturing system was used, and structures were printed and characterized using SEM and stylus profilometry. The model`s reliability was investigated under constant overlap and exposure conditions. The model is very robust under constant overlap conditions, with good agreement between experimental data and simulation. For constant exposure, there is good qualitative agreement, but discrepancies occur due to insufficient modeling of the spatial distribution of energy. The 3D printing of complex structures is demonstrated, and the model indicates that VPP-UVL-IE can offer, theoretically, faster printing compared to VPP-UVL-CE for large beam radius (>275 µm), under the assumption of Gaussian beam profile, constant irradiance during the pulses, and dwell time longer than beam travel time. Conversely, same levels of exposure can be achieved at higher scan speed using CW laser sources instead of pulsed sources for small beam radius (<275 µm). © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Intermittent exposure; Process modelling; Pulsed laser; Stereolithography; Work curve","3D printers; Additives; Gaussian beams; Photopolymerization; Spatial distribution; Surface analysis; Travel time; Condition; Curve modeling; Exposure conditions; Exposure system; Intermittent exposures; Laser scanning; Photo polymerization; Process-models; UV exposure; Work curves; Pulsed lasers","","","","","Canada Foundation for Innovation, CFI; ; Fonds Québécois de la Recherche sur la Nature et les Technologies, FQRNT; Canada Excellence Research Chairs, Government of Canada, CERC; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2018/06426-3, 2019/24367-7, 2015/ 22828-6, 18/24735-3)","This research was supported by the Canadian Excellence Research Chair Program (CERC) in Photonics Innovations.

Follow-up was conducted on this group over a period of 21 months. To investigate the failure of some of the FFF-printed transtibial sockets, further strength investigation is desired. Methods: A finite element (FE) analysis provided an extensive overview of the strength of the socket. Using follow-up data and FE analyses, weak spots were identified, and the required optimization/reinforcement of the socket wall was determined. Results: Five sockets with a 4 mm wall thickness were tested by five participants. The strength of the 4 mm prosthetic socket seemed to be sufficient for people with limited activity. The 4 mm sockets used by active participants failed at the patella tendon or popliteal area. One socket with a wall thickness of 6 mm was used by an active user and remained intact after one year of use. An FE analysis of the socket showed high stresses in the patella tendon area. An increased wall thickness of 7 mm leads to a decrease of 26% in the stress corresponding to the observed failure in the patella tendon area, compared to the 4 mm socket. Conclusions: Follow-up in combination with an FE analysis can provide insight into the strength of the transtibial socket. In future designs, both the patella tendon and popliteal area will be reinforced by a thickened trim line of 7 mm. A design with a thickened trimline of 7 mm is expected to be sufficiently strong for active users. Another follow-up study will be performed to confirm this. © 2022 by the authors.","design; FEM; FFF-printed; finite element analysis; follow-up; sockets; transtibial prosthesis","","","","","","","","WHO Standards for Prosthetics and Orthotics, (2017); Van der Stelt M., Verhamme L., Slump C.H., Brouwers L., Maal T.J.J., Strength testing of low-cost 3D-printed transtibial prosthetic socket, Proc.

Due to the shortcomings of low precision and difficulty in forming thermal conductive composites with complex structures in traditional technologies, it is necessary to explore a new forming process. Selective laser sintering (SLS) is an important 3D printing technology, which can manufacture diverse parts with complex shapes and be used in various fields. In this study, TPU/AlN/h-BN/MWCNTs composites were successfully developed by selecting three different dimensions of thermally conductive fillers and combining them with the SLS process. The research shows that the thermal conductivity of TPU composites can reach up to 1.13 W/mK with 20 wt% AlN, 15 wt% h-BN, and 1 wt% MWCNTs hybrid fillers, which is 491 % higher than that of pure TPU, ascribed to the synergistic effect of multi-dimensional fillers. In addition, the tensile strength and elongation at break of TPU/AlN/h-BN/MWCNTs composites maintain 16.5 MPa and 294 %, which still has excellent mechanical properties. This work also investigated the influence of fillers on the SLS process, thermal stability, melting, and crystallization behavior of composites. It reveals an effective, feasible strategy for TPU composites with excellent thermal conductive and complex shapes. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Composites; Multi-dimensional fillers; Selective laser sintering; Thermal conductivity; Thermal management materials","Additives; Boron nitride; Crystallization; Fillers; III-V semiconductors; Laser heating; Selective laser sintering; Sintering; Temperature control; Tensile strength; Thermal conductivity; Complex shapes; Electronics devices; Electronics fields; Enhanced thermal conductivity; Lower precision; Multi dimensional; Multi-dimensional filler; MWCNT's; Sintering process; Thermal management material; Aluminum nitride","","","","","Chinese German Centre for the Promotion of Science; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (GZ1448); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","The work was funded by the Chinese German Centre for the Promotion of Science via the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under grant number GZ1448 .

However, creep testing of these alloys at high temperatures shows that void coalescence and failure initiation occurs along the melt pool boundaries in the microstructure. Hence it is crucial to understand how the local mechanical behavior of the melt pool boundaries would influence the global properties of the AM produced alloy. In this study, in situ nanoindentation conducted at room temperature and 300 °C revealed a reduced hardness at the melt pool boundaries. Similarly, micro-pillar compression showed a slight decline in yield strength at these boundaries, indicating that they are the weak spots in the microstructure. Such multimodal local mechanical property studies are necessary for understanding the influence of melt pool boundaries on the bulk response of fusion-based AM alloys. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Aluminum alloys; Melt pool boundaries; Micro-pillar compression; Nanoindentation","","","","","","","","Kusoglu I.M., Gokce B., Barcikowski S., Research trends in laser powder bed fusion of Al alloys within the last decade, Addit.

However, these structures have limitations in energy absorption and reusability. Therefore, this study aimed to design, simulate, fabricate, and perform experimental tests on novel designed negative stiffness (NS) structures and improve the performances of negative stiffness structures in terms of energy absorption and keeping their original configuration under cyclic loading. First, the finite element method (FEM) and parametric study of the geometrical dimensions of NS members were considered to investigate the activation/non-activation snap-through mechanisms in the designed structures under quasi-static compression loading. Subsequently, two designed structures were manufactured via the Fused deposition modeling (FDM) printing method and one cyclic loading with a quasi-static state was carried out. The results of the FE simulation and experimental tests were compared, and good agreements were found between them. Afterward, the dissipated energy values and loss factor values of the designed structures under two cyclic loading (two loading/unloading processes) were investigated. Considering both the parameters of the energy absorption values and the remaining members in the elastic region, the proposed NSS was presented for energy absorber structures. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Cyclic loading; Energy absorption; Finite element method; Negative stiffness structures; Snap-through mechanism","Cyclic loads; Energy dissipation; Finite element method; Machine design; Mechanisms; Reusability; Stiffness; Cyclic loading; Design and analysis; Energy; Experimental test; Mechanical; Negative stiffness; Negative stiffness structure; Performance; Snap-through; Snap-through mechanism; Energy absorption","","","","","Iran National Science Foundation, INSF, (4012807); Iran National Science Foundation, INSF","This paper was supported by the Iran National Science Foundation : INSF under the research Grant No. 4012807 .

The required conditions, comparable to those prevalent in nature, can be provided by microfluidic dynamic cell cultures. Microfluidics can be used to fabricate and test the functionality and biocompatibility of newly developed nanosystems or to apply micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems embedded in a microfluidic system. However, the use of microfluidic systems is often hampered by their accessibility, acquisition cost, or customization, especially for scientists whose primary research focus is not microfluidics. Results: Here we present a method for 3D printing that can be applied without special prior knowledge and sophisticated equipment to produce various ready-to-use microfluidic components with a size of 100 µm. Compared to other available methods, 3D printing using fused deposition modeling (FDM) offers several advantages, such as time-reduction and avoidance of sophisticated equipment (e.g., photolithography), as well as excellent biocompatibility and avoidance of toxic, leaching chemicals or post-processing (e.g., stereolithography). We further demonstrate the ease of use of the method for two relevant applications: a cytotoxicity screening system and an osteoblastic differentiation assay. To our knowledge, this is the first time an application including treatment, long-term cell culture and analysis on one chip has been demonstrated in a directly 3D-printed microfluidic chip. Conclusion: The direct 3D printing method is tested and validated for various microfluidic components that can be combined on a chip depending on the specific requirements of the experiment. The ease of use and production opens up the potential of microfluidics to a wide range of users, especially in biomedical research. Our demonstration of its use as a cytotoxicity screening system and as an assay for osteoblastic differentiation shows the methods potential in the development of novel biomedical applications. With the presented method, we aim to disseminate microfluidics as a standard method in biomedical research, thus improving the reproducibility and transferability of results to clinical applications.

Such alloys must be devoid of cracks and large pores while exhibiting excellent mechanical performance. In this study, we demonstrated that the addition of 1 wt% titania (TiO2) nanoparticles to a 2219 Al alloy could substantially prevent hot-crack formation during L-PBF by significantly refining grains, which resulted in the formation of a nearly fully dense alloy with a high relative density (99.97%). This pronounced grain refinement was due to the solute effect of the Ti element with a high grain growth restriction factor (Q value) instead of the in-situ formation of lattice-matched L12-ordered Al3Ti particles. The processed alloy displayed an excellent combination of high ultimate tensile strength and elongation at both room and elevated temperatures, with these properties being comparable to those of its wrought counterpart and greater than those of 2219 Al alloys fabricated via other AM techniques. This low-cost pathway can also be applied to the AM of other Al alloys, which demonstrates its commercial significance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","2219 aluminium alloy; Additive manufacturing; Grain refinement; Laser powder bed fusion; Mechanical properties; TiO<sub>2</sub>","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Cost effectiveness; Cracks; Grain growth; Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; Tensile strength; TiO2 nanoparticles; Titanium alloys; 2219 aluminum alloys; Cost-effective approach; Elevated temperature; Grains refinement; High mechanical properties; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Nanotitanium; Powder bed; Strong demand; Titanium dioxide","","","","","International and Regional Science and Technology Cooperation Program of Changsha Science and Technology Project, (kh2201029); Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Additive Manufacturing of High-Performance Materials, (ZDSYS201703031748354); Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone Shenzhen Park Project, (HZQB-KCZYB-2020030); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51801096, 52074157); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Southern University of Science and Technology, SUSTech; Science and Technology Planning Project of Shenzhen Municipality, (JCYJ20180305123432756, KQTD20170328154443162); Science and Technology Planning Project of Shenzhen Municipality; Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2020B09092300); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2021A1313110348); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","Funding text 1: The authors are grateful to the Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province (grant number 2020B09092300 ), Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone Shenzhen Park Project (grant number HZQB-KCZYB-2020030 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 51801096 and 52074157 ), Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (grant number 2021A1313110348 ), International and Regional Science and Technology Cooperation Program of Changsha Science and Technology Project (grant number kh2201029 ), Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Additive Manufacturing of High-Performance Materials (grant number ZDSYS201703031748354 ) and Shenzhen Science and Technology Project (grant numbers JCYJ20180305123432756 and KQTD20170328154443162 ).

Herein, a photosensitive hydroxysiloxane HPMS-KH570 was employed as the resin matrix, which not only prevented the fiber agglomeration and improved the rheological properties of the slurries but also acted as a high-temperature binder to fix the fiber cross points after sintering and consequently improved the structural stability of the 3D-Muf-based porous ceramics. The effects of mullite fiber (Muf) aspect ratio and content on the performance of Muf slurries, microstructure and physical properties of the 3D-Muf-based porous ceramics were investigated. When the fiber aspect ratio was 45 and the fiber content was 6.67 vol%, the Muf slurry exhibited the most suitable properties for vat photopolymerization 3D printing, and the corresponding 3D-Muf-based porous ceramics exhibited a well-defined 3D printed lattice structure with struts consisting of randomly crisscrossing Muf. This unique 3D skeleton structure endowed the 3D-Muf-based porous ceramics with low density (0.47 g/cm3) and low room temperature thermal conductivity (0.11 W/(m·K)), enabling it a promising candidate for high-temperature (1000–1400 ℃) insulation materials. Furthermore, this printing strategy provided references for vat photopolymerization 3D printing of other fiber-based materials. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Mullite fiber; Porous ceramics; Rheological property; Thermal insulation property; Vat photopolymerization","3D printers; Fibers; Mullite; Photopolymerization; Rheology; Sintering; Thermal conductivity; Thermal insulation; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Fiber aspect ratio; Highest temperature; Mullite fibers; Photo polymerization; Porous ceramics; Rheological property; Thermal insulation properties; Vat photopolymerization; Aspect ratio","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52172072, 52172079); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 52172072 and 52172079 ).

Therefore, we propose an approach to improve the feature resolution without sacrificing the part size. It is achieved by changing the projection distance and then adjusting the projection resolution and format, which is different from the previous printing principle of fixed resolution. To achieve this process, the tripteron 3-Degree-of-Freedom (3-DoF) parallel mechanism is innovatively applied to the DLP 3D printing structure, which simplifies the control process. Since the projection is fixed on the motion platform, the projection distance changes as the platform moves in space. Then the PLC-based program is developed according to the motion process, which successfully runs on the established prototype. Finally, the experiments are designed through the orthogonal method to optimize the molding process parameters. The effectiveness of the approach is verified by the feature forming comparison experiment. The results show that it can reduce the size of features by about 1.3 times through adjusting the projection resolution under the same size parts. Our method provides a new way for solving the contradiction, but more research needs to be done. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing resolution; adjustable resolution; DLP 3D printing; kinematic analysis; orthogonal method; parallel mechanism","","","","","","Fundamental Research Funds for the Universities of Henan Province, (NSFRF210339); Henan Province Scientific and Technological Research Plan, (212102210045, 222102220008); Key Discipline of Mechanical Engineering in Henan Polytechnic University; University Doctoral Fund, (B2016-24)","This research was funded by Henan Province Scientific and Technological Research Plan (Grant Nos. 222102220008, 212102210045), Fundamental Research Funds for the Universities of Henan Province (Grant No. NSFRF210339) and Key Discipline of Mechanical Engineering in Henan Polytechnic University and the University Doctoral Fund (Grant No. B2016-24).","Mehrpouya M., Dehghanghadikolaei A., Fotovvati B., Vosooghnia A., Emamian S.S., Gisario A., The Potential of Additive Manufacturing in the Smart Factory Industrial 4.0: A Review, Appl.

Material extrusion additive manufacturing was used to produce stoichiometric, and calcium deficient HA preforms with a well-controlled open pore network, allowing the customization of the topological relationship of the composite. Pure Mg and two different Mg alloys were used to infiltrate the preforms by means of an advanced liquid infiltration method inspired by spark plasma sintering, using a novel die design to avoid the structural collapse of the preform. Complete infiltration was achieved in 8 min, including the time for the Mg melting. The short processing time enabled to restrict the decomposition of HA due to the reducing capacity of liquid Mg. The pure Mg-base composites showed compressive yield strength above pure Mg in cast state. Mg alloy-based composites did not show higher strength than the bare alloys due to grain coarsening, but showed similar mechanical properties than other Mg/HA composites that have significantly higher fraction of metallic phase. The composites showed faster degradation rate under simulated body conditions than the bare metallic component due to the formation of galvanic pairs at microstructural level. Mg dissolved preferentially over HA leaving behind a scaffold after a prolonged degradation period. In turn, the fast production of soluble degradation products caused cell metabolic changes after 24 h of culture with not-diluted material extracts. The topological optimization and reduction of the degradation rate are the topics for future research. © 2022","Biodegradable metal; Computed aided design; Direct ink writing; Interpenetrating phase composite; Metal infiltration; Topological relationship","Composites; Degradation; Infiltration; Liquids; Magnesium; Phases; Preforms; Production; 3D printers; Additives; Coarsening; Degradation; Hydroxyapatite; Magnesium alloys; Spark plasma sintering; Aided designs; Biodegradable metals; Computed aided design; Direct ink writing; Hydroxyapatite composite; Interpenetrating phase composites; Metal infiltration; Mg alloy; Pure Mg; Topological relationships; Topology","","","","","CONACYT-SNI; Ministerstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy, MŠMT; Grantová Agentura České Republiky, GA ČR, (19-22662S, LM2018110); Vysoké Učení Technické v Brně, BUT, (CEITEC VUT-J-19-5915, NU20-08-00150); Secretaría de Investigación y Posgrado, Instituto Politécnico Nacional, SIP, IPN, (SAPPI 20220438)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (grant 19-22662S ).

Defects may occur within the components at different time of manufacturing, and in this regard, non-destructive techniques (NDT) represent a key tool for the quality control of AM components in many industrial fields, such as aerospace, oil and gas, and power industries. In this work, the capability of active thermography and eddy current techniques to detect real imposed defects that are representative of the laser powder bed fusion process has been investigated. A 3D complex shape of defects was revealed by a µCT investigation used as reference results for the other NDT methods. The study was focused on two different types of defects: porosities generated in keyhole mode as well as in lack of fusion mode. Different thermographic and eddy current measurements were carried out on AM samples, providing the capability to detect volumetric irregularly shaped defects using non-destructive methods. © 2022, The Author(s).","Eddy current testing (ET); Keyhole and lack of fusion defects; Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) process; Micro-computed tomography (µCT); Non-destructive techniques NDT; Thermographic testing (TT); Typical defects in metal additive manufacturing (AM)","","","","","","","","DebRoy T., Wei H.L., Zuback J.S., Mukherjee T., Elmer J.W., Milewski J.O., Zhang W., Additive manufacturing of metallic components—process, structure and properties, Prog Mater Sci, 92, pp. 112-224, (2018); ASTM Committee F42 on Additive Manufacturing Technologies, & ASTM Committee F42 on Additive Manufacturing Technologies.

Therefore, this study investigated the effects of the process parameters and heat treatment on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4V fabricated using SLM. The influences of various process parameters on the relative density, tensile properties, impact toughness, and hardness of Ti-6Al-4V alloy parts were studied. By employing parameter optimization, a high-density high-strength Ti-6Al-4V alloy was fabricated by SLM. A relative density of 99.45%, a tensile strength of 1 188 MPa, and an elongation to failure of 9.5% were achieved for the SLM-fabricated Ti-6Al-4V alloy with optimized parameters. The effects of annealing and solution aging heat treatment on the mechanical properties, phase composition, and microstructure of the SLM-fabricated Ti-6Al-4V alloy were also studied. The ductility of the heat-treated Ti-6Al-4V alloy was improved. By applying a heat treatment at 850 °C for 2 h, followed by furnace cooling, the elongation to failure and impact toughness were found to be increased from 9.5% to 12.5%, and from 24.13 J/cm2 to 47.51 J/cm2, respectively. © 2022, Shanghai University and Periodicals Agency of Shanghai University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Heat treatment;

This approach overlooks the fact that historically, many engineering alloy system has been designed with a particular processing route in mind, e.g., ingot metallurgy, powder metallurgy, rapid quenching, etc. There are thus significant opportunities to design alloys specifically for AM. A key challenge is that alloy design requires performance metrics that can be optimized by exploring the alloy chemistry space. Here, we present a study in which we examine how intrinsic thermophysical properties can be used to estimate performance metrics related to the behavior of a solidifying metal droplet under AM-relevant conditions. By identifying these intrinsic properties, it is possible to directly incorporate ‘intrinsic printability’, specifically ‘intrinsic resistance to balling’, into AM-focused alloy design. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Alloy design; Balling; CALPHAD; Melting","","","","","","","","Pollock T., Clarke A., Babu S., Design and tailoring of alloys for additive manufacturing, Metall.

A key bottleneck issue which prevents L-PBF from further industrial adoption is the low repeatability of the process across different printers and powder batches. To explore and address the challenges of process repeatability, high-fidelity comprehensive physics-based modeling is desirable because it allows fast exploration of the process parameters space by simulations rather than by trial-and-error experiments. In this work, we present a complete framework which is capable of modeling defects (porosity) as well as microstructure explicitly in three dimensions and for multiple layers, effectively demonstrating explicit L-PBF of a digital cube of material at millimeter scale. The phase field method is coupled to the Lattice Boltzmann method, and the framework is used to model both the solid/liquid phase transitions as well as grain nucleation and growth. Explicit parallel scheme allows to run multiple simulations in a reasonable time and explore the role of process parameters on porosity and microstructure concurrently. After model calibration using experimentally-printed and characterized samples, the model was deployed across multiple parameter combinations. The predicted porosity and microstructure agreed well with the experiments. Our framework provides a practical demonstration of digitalization of the L-PBF process and paves the way for assessing process quality and repeatability by computer modeling and simulations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; INCONEL 718; Microstructure structure; Modeling","3D printers; Additives; Phase transitions; Porosity; Powder metals; Concurrent modeling; Inconel-718; Laser powders; Manufacturing IS; Microstructure structure; Modeling; Powder bed; Process parameters; Process repeatability; Three dimensional simulations; Microstructure","","","","","Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR; Science and Engineering Research Council, SERC; National Supercomputing Centre Singapore, NSCC, (A19E1a0097); National Supercomputing Centre Singapore, NSCC","Funding text 1: The authors gratefully acknowledge the use of computational resources at the A*STAR Computational Resource Center and the National Supercomputing Center Singapore (NSCC) and the project “Industrial Digital Design and Additive Manufacturing Workflows” (A19E1a0097).

The specimen was printed using a Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) technology. The response surface methodology was used for analysing all the experimental data and developing an effective empirical prediction model. The results of the study indicated that the generated model was not much significant with regards to absorption rate, while it was very significant for the surface roughness response parameter. A detailed analysis of the results indicated that layer thickness was the most significant factor that affected the surface roughness, while PCU composition affected the absorption rate. The optimal surface roughness (2.5400 µm) and absorption rate (0.0470%) of the printing process parameters was obtained when PCU concentration is 10 wt.%, layer thickness 0.1 mm, nozzle speed 15 mm/s and extruding temperature 195℃. © 2022, Malaysian Tribology Society (Mytribos).

The resulting knowledge insufficiency on support design can lead to in-process failures of the build. Also, parts can crack due to high, unaccounted residual stresses. This, and overestimated support designs, lead to an increased manufacturing time and cost. The presented research contributes to a better understanding of support structure design by developing a workflow for the design of tree-like support structure and its subsequent meta-model based parameter optimisation. The design parameters of resulting support structures for two generic geometries in a cantilever shape with a planar and an arched down-facing surface are compared with each other, showing consistent values for the minimum distance between branches and the branch length. These and other design parameters govern the geometry of the tree-like structure within the design space. An additionally performed sensitivity study revealed high correlations of the stem diameter with the part's displacements. Based on 500 individual support designs and the meta-model evaluation of 9000 parameter sets, a Pareto frontier emerges for the trade-off between the minimum support structure volume and the part's displacements. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; Design for additive manufacturing; Laser powder bed fusion; Parameter optimisation; Support structure","Additives; Economic and social effects; Ground supports; Powder metals; Shape optimization; Structural design; Structural optimization; Design for additive manufacturing; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Meta model; Metamodeling; Parameter optimization; Powder bed; Structure design; Support design; Support structures; 3D printers","","","","","Bill Song and Christoph Petroll of the 3D Printing Center; German Federal Ministry of Defense; Universität der Bundeswehr München","Funding text 1: We acknowledge financial support by Universität der Bundeswehr München, Germany and the German Federal Ministry of Defense .; Funding text 2: The authors like to thank Bill Song and Christoph Petroll of the 3D Printing Center at the Bundeswehr Research Institute for Materials, Fuels and Lubricants (WIWeB) for the PBF-LB/M print of test samples in order to evaluate the strain scaling factors.

This paper proposes a new approach based on the use of a Regression Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) algorithm to predict the percent of porosity in CT scans of finished SLM parts, without the need for subjective difficult thresholding determination to convert a single slice to a binary image. In order to test the algorithm, as the training of the RCNN would require a large amount of experimental data, this paper proposed a new efficient approach of creating artificial porosity images mimicking the real CT scan slices of the finished SLM part with a similarity index of 0.9976. Applying RCNN improved porosity prediction accuracy from 68.60% for image binarization method to 75.50% using the RCNN. The algorithm was then further developed by optimizing its parameters using Bees Algorithm (BA), which is known to mimic the behavior of honeybees, and the hybrid Bees Regression Convolutional Neural Network (BA-RCNN) produced better prediction accuracy with a value of 85.33%. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial porosity images; bees algorithm; deep learning; regression convolutional neural network; selective laser melting","","","","","","European Union’s Horizon2020 research and innovation programme, (820774)","This research was supported by the project Additive Manufacturing using Metal Pilot Line (MANUELA), which received funding from the European Union’s Horizon2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 820774.

Coaxial ring test pieces were printed by fused filament fabrication (FFF) technology with polylactic acid as the matrix and carbon black as the absorbent. The crystal texture and micromorphology of the composites were observed by XRD and SEM. The electromagnetic parameters were measured at 2–18 GHz using a vector network analyzer. The influence of CB content on the absorbing performance of the composites was studied, and the loss mechanism was explained. The results show that when the CB content (refers to PLA) is 25%, the composite has suitable impedance matching, conduction loss, and polarization loss, resulting in the best microwave absorption performance. The minimum reflection loss reached −45.47 dB at 13.68 GHz, and the corresponding effective absorption bandwidth was 5.36 GHz (10.72–16.08 GHz) with a matching thickness of 2.1 mm. At the same time, the density of the composite was only 1.19 g/cm3. This work sheds light on the development of lightweight and high-efficiency microwave absorption materials (MAMs) in a simple and low-cost manner. © 2022 by the authors.","carbon black; electromagnetic parameters; FFF filament; loss mechanism; microwave absorption performance","","","","","","Fujian Nature Science Foundation, (2016J01089, 2020J01067); Fujian Provincial Science and Technology Planning Project, (2019H0014, 2019H6016)","This research was funded by Fujian Nature Science Foundation, grant numbers 2016J01089 and 2020J01067.

The TMC samples were further subjected to annealing treatment at 900 °C for 30 minutes in an inert atmosphere. The influence of annealing treatment on the microstructure development was characterized using optical microscope and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The addition of TiB2 (0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 wt.%) induces drastic changes in the morphology of the as-built TMC samples. After annealing, a complete phase transformation occurred in pure Ti-6Al-4V alloy to lamellar shaped alpha and globular beta phase. In TMC samples, the increase in the weight fraction of TiB2 ceramic particles resulted in substantial grain refinement; however, grain coarsening was observed upon annealing treatment. Refinement in microstructure was associated with pinning effect of TiB whiskers. Coarsening of TiB whiskers also occurred with predominant increase in length as compared to width. Development in tribological performance was attributed to microstructure refinement. © 2022, ASM International.","additive manufacturing; SLM; Ti-6Al-4V; TiB whiskers; titanium matrix composite; wear resistance","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Annealing; Coarsening; Grain refinement; Heat resistance; Morphology; Scanning electron microscopy; Selective laser melting; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Tribology; Annealing treatments; Ceramics particles; Composite microstructures; Composite samples; Microstructure performance; Selective laser melting; Ti-6al-4v; TiB whisker; Titanium matrix composites; Tribological performance; Wear resistance","","","","","DST-IRPHA; Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, IITB","The authors would like to acknowledge the use of National facility of Texture and OIM (A DST-IRPHA project) and Nanoindentation lab of IIT Bombay.

However, additively manufactured IN718 parts suffer from anisotropic mechanical properties, and are usually inferior to conventionally produced parts. This is especially noticeable under dynamic loading conditions, where they suffer from lower fatigue strength and life, as well as lower reliability. This study focuses on post-processing heat treatments that aim to homogenize the microstructure of the additively manufactured IN718. Modified solution annealing treatments were proposed for IN718 samples, which were subsequently tensile tested. The microstructure of the treated specimens was then characterized using x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy imaging. The results showed that increasing the initial heat treatment temperature enhanced the isotropy, Young’s modulus, and ductility, at the expense of a slight reduction in the tensile strength. The further rise in the heat treatment temperature significantly increased the grain size and produced unfavorable precipitate morphology, which caused a brittle behavior. The work finally exhibits a modified heat treatment process for the additively manufactured IN718 material that successfully enhances its mechanical properties. © 2022, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.","","Additives; Dynamic loads; Fatigue of materials; Heat treatment; Morphology; Scanning electron microscopy; Tensile strength; Anisotropic mechanical properties; Dynamic loading conditions; Fatigue strength; Heat treatment temperature; Homogenization annealing; Inconel-718; Metal additives; New approaches; Powder bed; Solution annealing; Microstructure","","","","","","","Mortezaie A., Shamanian M., Int.

The high frequency of 1.5 MHz enables processing of 1.2 mm diameter wires without the need for indirect heating via a nozzle. The feasibility of the process is proven by the experimental identification of a proper process window regarding the influential parameters such as the distance between inductor and substrate, induction power and wire feed rate for the fabrication of single layers. Furthermore, a strategy for the successful fabrication of multi-layered cubes is developed. The microstructure of the cubes exhibits a characteristic variation along the build direction. Micro-computed tomography is used to reveal defects like lack of fusion and spherical pores in test cubes. The presented results are used to derive possible process improvements, which will allow the novel process to be used as a fast and powder-free alternative metal additive manufacturing route in future. © 2022 The Authors","AlSi7Mg; Induction heating; Micro-computed tomography; Semi-solid processing; Wire-feed additive manufacturing","","","","","","","","Ding D., Pan Z., Cuiuri D., Li H., Wire-feed additive manufacturing of metal components: technologies, developments and future interests, Int.

The fabricated component was investigated to reveal the phase transformations, microstructural features and nano-hardness. Further, wear test was conducted on specimens manufactured by both the methods as above, to study the tribological properties. XRD analysis showed that the SLM specimen has more intensity at (111) diffraction peak than the other two specimens and that the solid solution of γ-(Ni, Cr, Fe) (FCC) phases grew at (111), (2 0 0) and (220) planes. The Inconel-625 powder had lattice parameters 0.3592 nm, 0.3116 nm and 0.3012 nm, whereas the SLM specimen possessed the lattice parameters 0.3599 nm, 0.3121 nm and 0.3012 nm which were higher than the other two specimens. The microstructure analysis confirmed the presence of consistent and homogeneously equiaxed cell in the conventional alloy, whereas the SLM specimen possessed heterogeneous columnar structure. Along with the columnar cell, some equiaxed and cellular cell were also formed in the SLM specimen due to remelting of the overlapped region. Moreover, the formation of equiaxed cell in XY, YZ and ZX plane directions of the conventional alloy specimen and columnar cell in the SLM specimen was confirmed through Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis. The SLM-produced specimen exhibited higher nano-hardness due to the formation of angular columnar cell, fine hard phases, effective bonding strength and defect-free surface. Abrasive wear mechanism played an important role in both the samples. The wear rate of the conventional Inconel-625 alloy specimen was around 4.58 × 10–3 mm3/m while it was 1.83 × 10–3 mm3/m. The worn-out surface of the SLM specimen produced a lower roughness average compared with the conventional Inconel-625 specimen. Thus, the SLM technique is a promising and predominant technique to develop nickel-based superalloys for frictional applications.

Optimization of the parameters led to the formation of a planar melt pool. A homogeneous near-{001}<100> texture with suppressed high-angle grain boundary (HAGB) in high building heights of >20 mm was achieved without an SX seed. In addition, the planar melt pool suppressed the geometrically necessary dislocation accumulation and prevented strain-induced continuous dynamic recrystallization that could cause HAGB formation.

Although local application of growth factors or stem cells through various tissue engineering techniques are promising methods for the repair of tissue defects, limitations in their clinical application exist. Herein, we synthesized multifaceted nanohybrids composed of Quaternized chitosan (QCS), Graphene oxide (GO), and Polydopamine (PDA; QCS-GO-PDA). Covalent grafting of QCS and GO at a mass ratio of 5:1 (5QCS-1GO) displayed excellent biocompatibility and enhanced osteogenic ability, while addition of PDA (5QCS-1GO-PDA) reduced the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). 5QCS-1GO-PDA was able to achieve wound tissue regeneration by reducing the inflammatory response and enhancing angiogenesis. Furthermore, Polylactic acid/hydroxyapatite (PLA/HA) composite scaffolds were printed using Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) and the hybrid nanomaterial (5QCS-1GO-PDA) was used to coat the PLA/HA scaffold (5QCS-1GO-PDA@PLA/HA) to be used for rapid bone regeneration. 5QCS-1GO-PDA not only improved angiogenesis and osteogenic differentiation, but also induced M2-type polarization of macrophages and promoted bone regeneration via the BMP2/BMPRs/Smads/Runx2 signaling pathway. The bidirectional enhanced healing ability of the multifaceted nanohybrids 5QCS-1GO-PDA provides a promising method of effectively treating tissue defects. © 2022 The Authors","Angiogenesis; Multifunctional nanohybrids; Polydopamine; Quaternary chitosan; Tissue regeneration","bone morphogenetic protein 2; chitosan; graphene oxide; growth factor; hydroxyapatite; nanomaterial; polylactic acid; reactive oxygen metabolite; Smad protein; transcription factor RUNX2; angiogenesis; antibacterial activity; Article; biocompatibility; bone defect; bone development; bone regeneration; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell viability; healing; histology; human; human cell; human tissue; HUVEC cell line; immunomodulation; infection; inflammation; macrophage; polarization; selective laser sintering; signal transduction; thickness; tissue injury; tissue regeneration; vascular disease","","chitosan, 9012-76-4; hydroxyapatite, 1306-06-5, 51198-94-8; polylactic acid, 26100-51-6; Smad protein, 62395-38-4","","","Hubei Province Key Laboratory of Oral and Maxillofacial Development and Regeneration, (2021kqhm007); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (82002313, 82072444); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2021M701333); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Science and Technology Department of Hubei Province, (2020BCB004, 2021CFB425); Science and Technology Department of Hubei Province","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 82002313 , No. 82072444 ), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2021M701333 ).

However, optimisation of scanning strategy would result in improved material properties. Here, the optimal scanning strategy for fatigue-loaded high-performance aluminium alloys, such as Scalmalloy®, was investigated. This study demonstrates how to reduce uncontrolled interactions of the laser with the distinct weld plume, created by highly volatile alloying elements such as Mg. Tensile and fatigue testing were used to assess the structural integrity of specimens, in which different welding modes had been used. It is shown that a combination of: scan vector angle restriction; reduction of the scan vector length; and laser spot adjustments reduce the overall defect size and improves the build quality in Scalmalloy®. A bimodal microstructure with outstanding mechanical properties was observed: an ultimate tensile strength of 524 MPa was achieved with 17 % elongation at fracture. In order to evaluate the influence of the defect size, fatigue tests were performed at a stress ratio of R=0.1. Under optimal processing conditions, fatigue strengths of up to 360MPa at 3·107 cycles were obtained, significantly outperforming both conventionally and additively produced aluminium alloys. © 2022 The Author(s)","Fatigue; Laser Powder Bed Fusion; Parameter Study; Scalmalloy; Welding Mode","Alloying elements; Defects; Fatigue testing; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Welding; Defect size; Improved process; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Parameter studies; Performance; Powder bed; Scalmalloy; Scanning strategies; Welding modes; Additives","","","","","","","Zhang X., Liang E., Metal additive manufacturing in aircraft: current application, opportunities and challenges, IOP Conf.

All these factors severely affect the resistance to static and fatigue loadings of AMed components. Among the possible failure mechanisms, the failure promoted by static loadings when cracks are present is one of the most important failure conditions, in particular for the as-built parts, which might have reduced fracture toughness and ductility compared to the wrought alloy counterpart. In this work, we present a comprehensive approach to the static assessment of AlSi10Mg parts manufactured by Laser Powder Bed Fusion. Two benchmark fracture geometries were designed to investigate the typical AM geometrical features: i) thin walls in tension and ii) notched components in bending. Finite Element analyses of the benchmark specimens showed that an approach based on elastic–plastic fracture mechanics parameters is needed to correctly predict the experimental failures, despite the quasi-brittle behaviour shown by the AlSi10Mg alloy. In view of these results, this paper explores the applicability of the Failure Assessment Diagram (FAD), a tool used for conventional ductile materials, to static assessment of AMed parts. The results show that the assessment approach based on the FAD makes it possible to properly predict the experimental failures of the benchmark specimens. © 2022 The Author(s)","AlSi10Mg; Building orientation; Failure Assessment Diagram; Fracture toughness; Laser Powder Bed Fusion; Mechanical properties","Ductility; Failure (mechanical); Fracture mechanics; Surface defects; Building orientation; Failure assessment diagram; Failure mechanism; Fatigue loadings; Heterogeneous microstructure; Induced defects; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; Static loading; Fracture toughness","","","","","BEAMIT; European Space Agency, ESA, (4000129932/20/NL/AR); European Space Agency, ESA; Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank BEAMIT (Fornovo, Italy) for preparing the specimens tested in this research.

The microstructure of the as-fabricated alloy exhibited an extremely fine eutectic Al/Al11Ce3 co-continuous structure, i.e., Al11Ce3 intermetallics with an in-situ nano-network surrounding the interconnected Al matrix. It forms an equiaxed grain in the scanning direction (SD) and columnar grain in the building direction (BD). The yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) in SD and BD are 300 ± 11.5 MPa, 438 ± 6.9 MPa, and 303 ± 5.0 MP, 442 ± 3.3 MPa, about three times higher than those of as-cast alloy. The elongations (El) are 9.3 ± 0.7% and 6.2 ± 1.2% in SD and BD, respectively, exhibiting anisotropy. The perfect interfacial bonding between the Al11Ce3 phase and Al matrix combined with nano-scale network structures provided a strong ability to hinder the propagation of microcracks formed within Al11Ce3 particles. Besides, the alloy retained outstanding strength at elevated temperatures with 200 MPa at 300 °C and 100 MPa at 400 °C, which may be attributed to the heat resistance of nano-network Al11Ce3 intermetallics and the extremely low diffusion coefficient of Ce in the Al matrix. This work provides a new idea for developing heat-resistant aluminum alloys with a good combination of strength and ductility via additive manufacturing (AM) processing technique. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Al-Ce-Mg alloy; Co-continuous structure; Heat resistance; Laser powder bed fusion; Nano-network","Binary alloys; Cerium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Fabrication; Heat resistance; Intermetallics; Magnesium alloys; Nanotechnology; Specific heat; Tensile strength; Ternary alloys; Textures; Co-continuous structure; Equi-axed grains; Fabricated alloys; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; matrix; Nano-network structures; Nano-networks; Performance; Powder bed; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Major Scientific and Technological R&D Projects of Jiangxi Province, (20212AAE01003); Science and Technology Innovation Action Plan Project of Shanghai , China, (21XD1434900); Science and Technology Innovation Action Plan Project of Shanghai, China; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51821001, 51971136); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Shanghai Jiao Tong University, SJTU","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51971136 , 51821001 ), Science and Technology Innovation Action Plan Project of Shanghai , China (No. 21XD1434900 ) and the Major Scientific and Technological R&D Projects of Jiangxi Province , China (No. 20212AAE01003 ).

With micro-computed tomography (μCT), the complex pore architecture resulting from the layer-wise additive manufacturing was studied for two cases: a sample taken from the bulk as built hatching zone of a part and a sample representing the interface between the perimeter scan and hatching zone of a part. Five independent elastic constants describing transverse isotropic elastic anisotropy with respect to the building direction were determined by UPS and then correlated to the porosity description analysed via μCT. Anisotropy was found especially for longitudinal wave propagation. In all cases, consistent and reproducible results are obtained. Finally, the influence of porosity on the elastic properties was described with a power-law approach and a good agreement is obtained. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Exposure strategy; Laser powder bed fusion; Micro-computed tomography; Porosity; Ultrasonic phase spectroscopy","Anisotropy; Computerized tomography; Elasticity; Stiffness matrix; Ultrasonic testing; Wave propagation; Elastic properties; Exposure strategy; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Micro-computed tomography; Pore architecture; Powder bed; Stiffness matrices; Ultrasonic evaluation; Ultrasonic phase spectroscopy; Porosity","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (399233791)","This research was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) within the Project “SLM-Topo: Entwicklung einer prozessspezifischen Topologieoptimierungsmethode für die additive Fertigung von Leichtbaustrukturen am Beispiel des SLM-Verfahrens“ (Project number 399233791 ).

This work aims to develop diamond-containing metal composites filament to effectively fabricate ultrathin diamond blade. In this study, properties of filaments with different volumes of diamond and surface modifier were characterized and evaluated. The interface adhesion between the diamond particles and the binder matrix was enhanced with the surface modifier, thereby reducing the internal defects and improving the diamond distribution uniformity. Flexibility and tensile strength of the filaments could be greatly enhanced as the improved interfacial adhesion. Besides, the enhanced viscosity of the feedstock contributed to a closer adhesion between the deposited strands. Finally, ultrathin diamond blade with a sintered density of 95.2 % could be achieved with the optimized filament. The results demonstrate the ability of the optimized filament to fabricate diamond tool via fused filament fabrication. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Diamond tool; Fused filament fabrication; Interface adhesion; Properties of composites filament; Surface modifier","Adhesion; Diamond cutting tools; Tensile strength; Diamond blades; Diamond tool; Fused filament fabrication; Interface adhesion; Metal composites; Properties of composites; Property evaluation; Property of composite filament; Surface modifiers; Ultra-thin; Fabrication","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41872186); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2020JJ5141); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFB3701804)","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China [No. 2021YFB3701804 ], and the Surface Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China [No. 41872186 ],and the Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [No. 2020JJ5141 ].","Lavrinenko V.I., Current advances in the development of abrasive tools and investigation of diamond abrasive machining processes (materials science approach), J.Superhard Mater., 40, pp. 348-354, (2018); Chen B., Chen P., Huang Y.J., Xu X.X., Li Y.B., Wang S.X., Blade segment with a 3D lattice of diamond grits fabricated via an additive manufacturing process, Chin.

Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and energy disperse spectroscopy were employed to characterize the oxidation products on investigated 316L. Results showed that oxidation kinetics of all samples followed a parabolic law from 600 °C to 900 °C. At 700 °C, cold-rolled 316L exposed a better oxidation resistance, while selective laser melting 316L was more resistant to oxidation at 600 °C, 800 °C and 900 °C. The above oxidation behavior may be caused by the recrystallization of cold-rolled 316L and high density of grain boundaries in selective laser melting 316L. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","316L; CO<sub>2</sub>; Metal; Oxidation; Selective laser melting","Carbon dioxide; Cold rolling; Melting; Metal cladding; Oxidation resistance; Scanning electron microscopy; Selective laser melting; Thermooxidation; 316L; Cold-rolled; High temperature oxidation Behavior; Oxidation kinetics; Oxidation products; Parabolic law; Selective laser melting; X- ray diffractions; X-ray energies; Grain boundaries","","","","","Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE","The project is supported by Key Laboratory of Power Station Energy Transfer Conversion and System of Ministry of Education .","Blakey-Milner B., Et al., Mater.

However, a poor fit of fixed-size radiofrequency (RF) coils to the subject often limits the SNR both in research and clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) practice. Therefore, there is an urgent need to fabricate RF coils that exhibit a close geometrical fit (or are subject conformal) to the to-be-imaged region. A range of 3D printing methods are proposed for producing such conformal coils and overcoming constraints in geometrical complexity, production time, and cost. Laser powder bed fusion and stereolithography-based methods are explored. The fully digital workflow allows for the seamless integration of electromagnetic simulations of geometrically complex coils, resulting in rapid design iterations. SNR gains up to 68% are observed for single 3D-printed subject-conformal coils compared to a state-of-the-art commercially available (nonconformal) coil array. In addition to tests on phantoms, a conformal 3D-printed coil is used to image the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb from a volunteer on an MRI scanner to demonstrate the improved image quality. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","3D printing; additive manufacturing; magnetic resonance imaging; personalized medicine; radiofrequency coils","3D printers; Additives; Clinical research; Electromagnetic simulation; Image enhancement; Resonance; Scanning; Signal to noise ratio; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Fixed size; Geometrical complexity; High quality; High signal-to-noise ratio; Personalized medicines; Printing method; Production cost; Radio-frequency coil; Magnetic resonance imaging","","","","","European Commission, EC; H2020 INSPiRE-Med; H2020 INSPiRE‐Med, (813120); Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, FWO, (1SB8519N); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (945539); KU Leuven, (C3/21/027, IDN/20/016); European Union's Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, (C14/21/111)","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the financial support from KU Leuven (IDN/20/016 and C3/21/027), and the technical expertise of Wouter Depuydt.

Four copper samples have been printed via Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) at DIAM Laboratory (INFN—Sezione di Padova, Padova, Italy). Samples had different geometrical characteristics, to test the feasibility of the AM as a productive technique for the creation of unsupported copper structures that are characterized by surfaces with a very small inclination angle, where supports cannot be placed. Parts have been printed successfully even in case of 18° of inclination of unsupported walls with respect to the horizontal plane, and on the same samples, surface finishing treatments (performed by Rösler Italiana S.r.l. and INFN-LNL) have been performed to reduce the roughness of the down-facing surfaces. Indeed, the down-skin regions are the most critical areas of AM parts. Several surface treatments are under investigation: mass-finishing treatments (mechanical and chemically assisted mechanical processes), chemical polishing, and electropolishing, and for some of them, the results are extremely positive: from an initial roughness (Ra) of 30–35 µm, the treatments allowed us to achieve a Ra value lower than 1 µm. The study here exposed presents a good way to rapidly reduce the roughness of 3D-printed parts, reaching a mirror-like aspect. © 2022, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; Copper; LPBF; Polishing; Roughness; Surface finishing","3D printers; Additives; Chemical mechanical polishing; Copper; Electrolytic polishing; Copper components; Finishing treatment; Fusion technology; Geometrical characteristics; Industrial scenarios; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Manufacturing IS; Powder bed; Surface finishing; Surface roughness","","","","","Centro studi di Economia e Tecnica dell’Energia Giorgio Levi Cases, Università degli Studi di Padova, LC; Euratom Research and Training Programme; Università degli Studi di Padova, UNIPD; Innovation Fostering in Accelerator Science and Technology; Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Padova e Rovigo; Dipartimento di Psicologia Generale, Università degli Studi di Padova, DPG; European Commission, EC, (101052200); European Commission, EC; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (101004730); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020","Funding text 1: Open access funding provided by Universit\u00E0 degli Studi di Padova within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.

This study presents a novel ultraviolet-curable polysiloxane precursor for digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing to fabricate ceramic parts with complex geometry, no cracks and linear shrinkage. Guiding with the principles of impedance matching, attenuation, and effective-medium theory, we design a cross-helix-array metamaterial model based on the complex permittivity constant of precursor-derived ceramics. The corresponding ceramic metamaterials can be successfully prepared by DLP printing and subsequent pyrolysis process, achieving a low reflection coefficient and a wide effective absorption bandwidth in the X-band even under high temperature. This is a general method that can be extended to other bands, which can be realized by merely adjusting the unit structure of metamaterials. This strategy provides a novel and effective avenue to achieve “target-design-fabricating” ceramic metamaterials, and it exposes the downstream applications of highly efficient and broad EM wave-absorbing materials and structures with great potential applications.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2022, The Author(s).","3D printing; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Metamaterial; Precursor-derived ceramics","3D printers; Circular waveguides; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Electromagnetic waves; Silicones; Structural design; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Ceramic parts; Complex geometries; Digital light processing; Impedance matchings; Linear shrinkage; Precursor-derived ceramics; Ultraviolet curable; Ultraviolet-curable; Metamaterials","","","","","Innovation Team of Shaanxi Sanqin Scholars; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (21975204); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars, (52025034); National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars","This research is supported by the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (52025034), National Natural Science Foundation of China (21975204), and Innovation Team of Shaanxi Sanqin Scholars.

It can result in material performance that differs from conventionally processed metal. This work studies spatial and orientation-based differences in tensile properties of nickel-based alloy IN718 using in-situ x-ray computed tomography to observe internal pore populations. Anisotropy and spatial variability in mechanical properties are shown while the evolution of pore shape during deformation is measured. Measured pore deformation is compared to predict deformations simulated using a computational crystal plasticity scheme, which provides insight, through inverse modeling, to the grain orientation in which the pore resides. The measurements provide a high fidelity method to compare experimental and computational approaches to pore deformation studies. Pore deformation measurements show that pores tend to grow and elongate in the direction of loading, consistent with ductile deformation and likely deforming with the material. Generally, the pore defects observed in this material (not from lack-of-fusion) do not cause so-called premature failure, and fully developed necking occurs prior to fracture. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Directed energy deposition; In-situ X-ray CT; Mechanical property variations; Model verification; Pore mechanics; Tensile testing","3D printing; Additives; Computerized tomography; Crystal orientation; Deposition; Ductile fracture; Fracture testing; Inverse problems; Metal testing; Nickel alloys; Directed energy; Directed energy deposition; Energy depositions; In-situ tensile testing; In-situ X-ray CT; Mechanical property variation; Model verification; Pore mechanic; X-ray computed tomography; X-ray CT; Tensile testing","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (DMR-1720139); National Science Foundation, NSF; National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST; Northwestern University, NU, (15-07-07, CMMI-1762035, CMMI-1934367); Northwestern University, NU; Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, Harvard University, MRSEC","Funding text 1: This work made use of the MatCI Facility which receives support from the MRSEC Program (National Science Foundation DMR-1720139) of the Materials Research Center at Northwestern University.

Teknika Utara, Yogyakarta, 55281, Indonesia","Currently, multi-material approach has become an interesting research subject in the field of materials engineering and additive manufacturing technology. With this technique, the properties of a 3D-printed material could be tailored by combining two or more dissimilar materials with certain configurations such as the sandwich structures. So far, the studies concerning such sandwich-structured FFF multi-material system is, however, still lacking. In this research, mechanical properties of the sandwich-structured FFF-processed multi-material parts composed of a rigid polylactic acid (PLA) and a flexible thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) were determined. Three groups of specimens with various sandwich configurations were examined in terms of their maximum tensile strength, strain at break and elastic modulus. In addition, a Shore D hardness analysis was carried out to point out the benefits of having the multi-material structure in the FFF-processed polymeric material. The result of this study showed that the combination of PLA/TPU in a sandwich form could improve the low strength and elastic modulus of an FFF-processed monolithic TPU elastomer. In this case, the tensile strength and elastic modulus of the sandwich-structured PLA/TPU multi-material were higher than those of the printed monolithic TPU. However, this strategy was not successful for improving the low strain-at-break possessed by the FFF printed monolithic PLA material. On the basis of the analysis over the fractured surface of the specimen, the low affinity and low compatibility between the deposited PLA and TPU material obviously caused the failure of this sandwich-structured FFF-processed PLA/TPU multi-material. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Mechanical properties; Multi-material; PLA; Sandwich structure; TPU","","","","","","","","Dizon J.R.C., Espera A.H., Chen Q., Advincula R.C., Mechanical characterization of 3D-printed polymers, Addit Manuf, 20, pp. 44-67, (2018); Vyavahare S., Teraiya S., Panghal D., Kumar S., Fused deposition modelling: a review, Rapid Prototyp J, 26, pp. 176-201, (2020); Lee Ventola C., Medical applications for 3D printing: Current and projected uses, Pharm Therapeutic, 39, pp. 704-711, (2014); Tan L.J., Zhu W., Zhou K., Recent progress on polymer materials for additive manufacturing, Adv Funct Mater, 30, (2020); Sathies T., Senthil P., Anoop M.S., A review on advancements in applications of fused deposition modelling process, Rapid Prototyp J, 26, pp. 669-687, (2020); Uriondo A., Esperon-Miguez M., Perinpanayagam S., The present and future of additive manufacturing in the aerospace sector: a review of important aspects, Proc Inst Mech Eng Part G J Aerosp Eng, 229, pp. 2132-2147, (2015); Colorado H.A., Mendoza D.E., Valencia F.L., A combined strategy of additive manufacturing to support multidisciplinary education in arts, biology, and engineering, J Sci Educ Technol, 30, pp. 58-73, (2021); Sood A.K., Ohdar R.K., Mahapatra S.S., Experimental investigation and empirical modelling of FDM process for compressive strength improvement, J Adv Res, 3, pp. 81-90, (2012); Han D., Lee H., Recent advances in multi-material additive manufacturing: methods and applications, Curr Opin Chem Eng, 28, pp. 158-166, (2020); Baca D., Ahmad R., The impact on the mechanical properties of multi-material polymers fabricated with a single mixing nozzle and multi-nozzle systems via fused deposition modeling, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 106, pp. 4509-4520, (2020); Espalin D., Ramirez J.A., Medina F., Wicker R., Multi-material, multi-technology FDM: exploring build process variations, Rapid Prototyp J, 20, pp. 236-244, (2014); Ruiz O.G., Dhaher Y., Multi-color and multi-material 3D printing of knee joint models, 3D Print Med, 7, pp. 1-16, (2021); Lopes L.R., Silva A.F., Carneiro O.S., Multi-material 3D printing: the relevance of materials affinity on the boundary interface performance, Addit Manuf, 23, pp. 45-52, (2018); Bandyopadhyay A., Heer B., Additive manufacturing of multi-material structures, Mater Sci Eng R Rep, 129, pp. 1-16, (2018); Tamburrino F., Graziosi S., Bordegoni M., The influence of slicing parameters on the multi-material adhesion mechanisms of FDM printed parts: an exploratory study, Virtual Phys Prototyp, 14, pp. 316-332, (2019); Zhang Y.F., Ng C.J., Chen Z., Zhang W., Panjwani S., Kowsari K., Yang H.Y., Ge Q., Miniature pneumatic actuators for soft robots by high-resolution multimaterial 3D printing, Adv Mater Technol, 4, (2019); Emon M.O.F., Alkadi F., Philip D.G., Kim D.H., Lee K.C., Choi J.W., Multi-material 3D printing of a soft pressure sensor, Addit Manuf, 28, pp. 629-638, (2019); Coelho G., Chaves T.M.F., Goes A.F., Del Massa E.C., Morses O., Yoshida M., Multimaterial 3D printing preoperative planning for frontoethmoidal meningoencephalocele surgery, Childs Nerv Syst, 34, pp. 749-756, (2018); Arifvianto B., Wirawan Y.B., Salim U.A., Suyitno S., Mahardika M., Effects of extruder temperatures and raster orientations on mechanical properties of the FFF-processed polylactic-acid (PLA) material, Rapid Prototyp J, 27, pp. 1761-1775, (2021); Arifvianto B., Iman T.N., Prayoga B.T., Dharmastiti R., Salim U.A., Mahardika M., Suyitno,, Tensile properties of the FFF-processed thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) elastomer, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 117, pp. 1709-1719, (2021); Xiao J., Gao Y., The manufacture of 3D printing of medical grade TPU, Prog Addit Manuf, 2, pp. 117-123, (2017); Ribeiro M., Sousa Carneiro O., Ferreira da Silva A., Interface geometries in 3D multi-material prints by fused filament fabrication, Rapid Prototyp J, 25, pp. 38-46, (2019); Luna C.B.B., Siqueira D.D., Araujo E.M., Wellen R.M.R., Annealing efficacy on PLA.

The TPE polymer was synthesized from polycaprolactone (PCL) diol, hexamethylene diisocyanate, Tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate, and 1,4-butanediol, then purified via rotary evaporation and vacuum drying. Biocompatibility was verified using a cell counting kit (CCK-8) with NIH/3T3 cells. Tensile mechanical properties were quantified, and the TPE was reliable for more than 104 cycles, and up to 107 cycles in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) heated to 37 °C. Its lack of chemical crosslinking allows it to remain a thermoplastic, able to be melted and extruded for 3D printing at or above 120 °C using compressed nitrogen gas. Cardiac MRI scans of Sprague Dawley rats were converted to a 3D solid model, and a pericardial scaffold was designed and 3D printed for in vitro testing as a precursor to preclinical trials. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D-printing; Cardiac; Dilated cardiomyopathy; Elastomer; Polycaprolactone; Scaffold; Thermoplastic","1,4 butanediol; 2 ethylhexanoate; chemical compound; cholecystokinin octapeptide; dichloromethane; elastomer; hexamethylene diisocyanate; nitrogen; phosphate buffered saline; polycaprolactone; thermoplastic polycaprolactone; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; biocompatibility; cell viability; computer assisted tomography; congestive cardiomyopathy; controlled study; cross linking; diastolic blood pressure; fibroblast; heart cycle; mouse; NIH 3T3 cell line; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pericardium; rat; Sprague Dawley rat","","1,4 butanediol, 110-63-4; cholecystokinin octapeptide, 25126-32-3; dichloromethane, 75-09-2; hexamethylene diisocyanate, 11142-52-2, 822-06-0; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; polycaprolactone, 24980-41-4, 25248-42-4","7T Bruker, Bruker","Bruker","MRI machine","Special thanks to Craig Hamilton, Ph.D. for assistance with acquisition and analysis of MR images and to Youngkyoo Jung, Ph.D. for building MRI scan protocols, operating the MRI machine, and suggesting post-processing approaches.","Shor L., Guceri S., Chang R., Gordon J., Kang Q., Hartsock L., An Y., Sun W., Precision extruding deposition (PED) fabrication of polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds for bone tissue engineering, Biofabrication, 1, 1, (2009); Yilgor P., Sousa R., Reis R., Hasirci N., Hasirci V., 3D plotted PCL scaffolds for stem cell based bone tissue engineering, Macromol.

Herein, an AlCoCrFeNi2.1 EHEA with dual-phase nanolamellar structure and high strength and ductility (yield strength (σYS) = 1210 MPa, ultimate tensile strength (σUTS) = 1414 MPa, and elongation (ε) = 16%) was produced using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). The AlCoCrFeNi2.1 EHEA presented fine-grain structure with nanoprecipitates (L12 and BCC phases) embedded within alternating FCC and B2 nano-scale lamellae. We demonstrated that the high strength of the EHEA originated primarily from the high back stress strengthening of fine grains and high-density heterophase interfaces, and high dislocation density caused by rapid solidification as well as dispersed nanoparticles provided extra strengthening. Furthermore, the cellular structure comprising nearly square FCC cells and surrounding B2 phases was observed, which was induced by the presence of oxides on the surface of the feedstock powder. AlCoCrFeNi2.1 EHEA with two-hierarchical dual-phase structure, that is, a mixture of lamellar and cellular structures, was obtained. Such heterogeneous structure presented outstanding strength–ductility synergy (σYS = 1042 MPa, σUTS = 1303 MPa, and ε = 26%). These results promote the development of high-performance materials with manufacturing flexibility using additive manufacturing approaches to tailor their multiscale microstructure. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Eutectic high entropy alloy; Laser powder bed fusion; Rapid solidification; Strain hardening; Strengthening mechanism","Cellular automata; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Crystal structure; Ductility; Entropy; Fabrication; High-entropy alloys; Nanotechnology; Precipitation (chemical); Rapid solidification; Strain hardening; Tensile strength; Cellular structure; Ductile phase; Eutectic high entropy alloy; Hard phase; High entropy alloys; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; Strength-ductility synergies; Strengthening mechanisms; Eutectics","","","","","Innovation Foundation for Doctor Dissertation of Northwestern Polytechnical University, (CX2021056, CX2021066, CX2022033); Joint Research Funds of the Department of Science & Technology of Shaanxi Province; Science Research Funds of Xi'an City, (21ZCZZHXJS-QCY6-005); Science and Technology Innovation Team Plan of Shann Xi Province, (2021TD-17); Thousands Person Plan of Jiangxi Province, (JXSQ2020102131); Youth Innovation Team of Shaanxi Universities; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51822405, 52130204, 52174376); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Northwestern Polytechnical University, NPU, (2020GXLH-Z-024); Northwestern Polytechnical University, NPU; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (D5000210902); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2021B1515120028); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","This work was supported by the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (grant number 2021B1515120028 ); National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 52130204 , 52174376 , 51822405 ); Science and Technology Innovation Team Plan of Shann Xi Province (grant number 2021TD-17 ); the Youth Innovation Team of Shaanxi Universities , Joint Research Funds of the Department of Science & Technology of Shaanxi Province and NPU (grant number 2020GXLH-Z-024 ); Thousands Person Plan of Jiangxi Province (grant number JXSQ2020102131 ); Science Research Funds of Xi'an City (grant number 21ZCZZHXJS-QCY6-005 ); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (grant number D5000210902 ); Innovation Foundation for Doctor Dissertation of Northwestern Polytechnical University (grant numbers CX2022033 , CX2021056 , CX2021066 ).

The single-crystal repair is characterised by a fine columnar dendritic substructure, limited in-grain misorientation over tens of millimetres in height, and strong deposit-to-substrate bonding. The brighter contrast region of 300 to 400 μm thick, formed by the cellular solidification front, sits above the melted back region with a horizontal low-angle boundary (4° misorientation) in-between. Its higher hardness of 450 HV is attributed to the fine cuboidal primary γ′ of 135 ± 7 nm. Their presence is a combined effect of high cooling rate and limited local compositional difference. The Scheil-Gulliver predicted solute partitioning of Ta and Hf to the inter-dendritic region agrees well with the MC carbides appearing at the columnar dendritic and cellular boundaries. Computational-fluid-dynamics (CFD) simulations, combined with the minimum undercooling criterion, helps to determine the vertical distance between the melt-pool bottom and the oriented-to-misoriented transition borderline, providing a convenient guideline to assess the single-crystal likelihood, in a sense that this distance needs to be larger than the hatch depth. The CFD-calculated solidification velocities and thermal gradients agree with the columnar-to-equiaxed transition curve and the experimental observation. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Ni-base superalloys; Repair; Selective electron beam melting; Single crystal; Solidification","Additives; Carbides; Computational fluid dynamics; Electron beam melting; Electron beams; Nickel alloys; Repair; Single crystals; Solidification; Superalloys; Textures; Cellulars; Dendritics; Grain misorientation; High reliability; Ni-base superalloys; Powder bed; Selective electron beam melting; Single-crystal Ni-base superalloys; Solidification fronts; Substrate bonding; 3D printers","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/P025978/1, EP/R043973/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFB3700501); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; National Major Science and Technology Projects of China, (J2019-VII-0016-0157); National Major Science and Technology Projects of China","Bo Chen acknowledges financial supports by the UK’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC First Grant Scheme EP/P025978/1 and Early Career Fellowship Scheme EP/R043973/1.

Designated 'C', this oxygen-rich FCC phase has a lattice parameter of 0.406 nm and exhibits an orientation relationship with the parent α′ phase as follows: (0 0 0 1)α′//{1 1 1}C, and 〈12¯10〉α′ //〈11¯0〉C. We propose that the formation of the C phase is facilitated by the combined effect of thermal gradients, deformation induced by the martensitic transformation, and local O enrichment. This enables an in-situ phase transformation from the hexagonal close-packed α′ phase to the C phase at elevated temperatures. Our density functional theory calculations indicate that oxygen occupancy in the octahedral interstices of the FCC structure is energetically preferred to corresponding sites in the α′ phase. The in-situ mechanical testing results indicate that the presence of the FCC phase significantly increases the local yield strength from 1.2 GPa for samples with only the α′ phase to 1.9 GPa for samples comprising approximately equal volume fractions of the α′ and FCC phases. No loss of ductility was reported, demonstrating great potential for strengthening and work hardening. We discuss the formation mechanism of the FCC phase and a pathway for future microstructural design of titanium alloys by additive manufacturing. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; FCC Ti; Interstitial strengthening; Mechanical properties","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Density functional theory; Martensitic transformations; Mechanical testing; Strain hardening; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Combined effect; Cubic solid solutions; Face-centered cubic phasis; Face-centered cubic ti; Face-centred cubic; Interstitial strengthening; Interstitials; Laser powders; Orientation relationship; Powder bed; Oxygen","","","","","AUSMURI; National Computational Infrastructure, NCI; Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative, MURI; Australian Government; Australian Research Council, ARC, (DE180100440, DP150104719, DP190102243, DP200100940, P0039966, P0041361); Australian Research Council, ARC; University of Sydney, Usyd; Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU","Funding text 1: This project is supported by the Australia–US Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (AUSMURI) program (3Dadditive.com.au).

An important input for the analytical modeling calculations is the peak residual stress for a deposited layer, which is estimated using a unique functional relationship and presented as a function of important process conditions for laser powder bed fusion of different powder alloys. The analytically calculated results of longitudinal residual stress distributions through the part and baseplate thickness are tested rigorously with the corresponding numerically computed and experimentally measured results in the literature for laser powder bed fusion of small and large parts involving the deposition of several thousands of layers. It is shown further that the analytical model can serve as a fast and practical design tool to estimate the through-thickness longitudinal residual stress distribution, which is along the length of the part, for part scale laser powder bed fusion using inexpensive computational resources and with appreciable accuracy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Analytical modeling; Dimensional analysis; Laser powder bed fusion; Part scale; Residual stress distribution","Analytical models; Nickel alloys; Residual stresses; Stainless steel; Stress concentration; Titanium alloys; Analytical modeling; Dimensional analysis; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Longitudinal residual stress; Part scale; Powder alloys; Powder bed; Residual stresses distributions; Through-thickness; 3D printers","","","","","","","Sing S.L., Yeong W.Y., Laser powder bed fusion for metal additive manufacturing: perspectives on recent developments, Virtual Phys.

Aimed at controlling material properties to suit functional requirements, there has been a considerable demand in recent years to manufacture multi-materials with locally different chemical compositions from one material composition to another. However, due to the technical difficulties of MAM, MAM-processed multi-materials have a fundamental limitation of high defect probability near the interface. In this study, to overcome the limitations of MAM-processed multi-materials, we proposed a new strategy for multi-material fabrication by depositing a single layer of CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) on a cold-rolled CoCrNi medium-entropy alloy (MEA) substrate using direct energy deposition. The prepared CoCrNi–CoCrFeMnNi multi-material exhibits both structural and compositional heterogeneity, and no defects were observed. In addition, it has a superior strength-ductility combination compared to the individual properties of homogeneous CoCrNi MEA and CoCrFeMnNi HEA owing to a synergetic strengthening effect with the heterogeneous microstructure. © 2022","Functionally graded structure; High-entropy alloys; Mechanical properties; Microstructure","3D printers; Additives; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Cold rolling; Defects; Entropy; Fabrication; High-entropy alloys; Iron alloys; Manganese alloys; Metal cladding; Substrates; Energy depositions; Functional requirement; Functionally graded structure; High entropy alloys; Manufacturing IS; Medium entropy; Metal additives; Metallic material; Multi materials; Processing technologies; Microstructure","","","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (NRF-2021R1A2C3006662, NRF-2022R1A5A1030054); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","Funding: This study was financially supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIP) ( NRF-2021R1A2C3006662 ) and ( NRF-2022R1A5A1030054 ).","Yeh J.-W., Chen S.-K., Lin S.-J., Gan J.-Y., Chin T.-S., Shun T.-T., Tsau C.-H., Chang S.-Y., Nanostructured high-entropy alloys with multiple principal elements: novel alloy design concepts and outcomes, Adv.

Giusti 9, Firenze, 50121, Italy","The Powder Bed Fusion-Laser Beam\Metals (PBF-LB\M) is a promising additive manufacturing process that can be used to directly produce functional components with a complex shape for a wide variety of applications. However, the layer-by-layer scanning and high cooling rates result in a high thermal gradient and thus, in thermally induced stresses. The stresses developed during the additive process could lead to undesirable cracking and delamination phenomena that can seriously affect the performance of the final component. The alloy composition can exacerbate crack and delamination formation, however, the need to expand the portfolio of high-strength materials processable for PBF-LB\M makes the resolution of these undesirable phenomena a primary challenge in the additive manufacturing field. This works aims to systematically investigate some strategies to make processable non-standard compositions. As no standard compositions, the promising pre-alloyed AlSi10Cu8Mg composition was chosen for the present work. Based on the results obtained from a condition of severe delamination, the synergetic use of appropriate process parameters and support structures can lead to crack-free and fully dense specimens also when platform heating is not allowed. The developed approach could also be applied to adapt other cracking-sensitive alloys for PBF-LB\M production. © 2022","Aluminium alloys; Cracking-sensitive alloy; PBF-LB\M; Process parameters; Processability; Residual stresses; Support structures","3D printers; Additives; Cracks; Ground supports; Additive manufacturing process; Cracking-sensitive alloy; Fusion lasers; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion-laser beam\metal; Process parameters; Processability; Processable; Standard composition; Support structures; Laser beams","","","","","","","Avateffazeli M., Et al., Correlation between tensile properties, microstructure, and processing routes of an Al–Cu–Mg–Ag–TiB2 (A205) alloy: additive manufacturing and casting, Mater.

One solution from a design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) perspective is to arrange a hatching strategy that utilizes the asymmetry of the residual stress generated from a molten pool. Another approach is to arrange the geometry of the parts, such as forming an inner lattice structure to arrange the effective stiffness. In this study, the simultaneous optimization of the laser hatching orientation and lattice density distribution was conducted to minimize the residual warpage in lattice infill structures and confirm their synergetic effect. The mutual effect of each layer was highlighted when considering the mechanical background of the optimal results because an imbalance in the residual stress caused the warpage of the AM parts between the layers. The proposed methodology was validated via experimental verification using a quasi-2D plate, 3D bracket, and 3D connecting-rod design problems. The residual warpage in the quasi-2D study, measured as the edge's vertical deformation, was reduced from 23.4% to 39.4% compared with the benchmark design. In the 3D studies, the warpage reductions ranged from 13.1% to 20.7%. © 2022 The Author(s)","Design optimization; Inherent strain method; Residual deformation; Scanning strategy; Variable lattice density","3D printers; Additives; Benchmarking; Deformation; Powder metals; % reductions; Design optimization; Inherent strain methods; Lattice density; Orientation density; Residual deformation; Residual warpage; Scanning strategies; Simultaneous optimization; Variable lattice density; Residual stresses","","","","","JST A-Step, (JPMJTR192A); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-NE0008994); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (18H01351, 18KK0412, 19H05625); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN","This work is partially supported by the JST A-Step Seeds development type, Japan ( JPMJTR192A ) and the JSPS, Japan KAKENHI ( 19H05625 , 18KK0412 and 18H01351 ).

In this work, the discrete element method (DEM) was used to reproduce a powder bed of particles distributed in a random way to be as close as possible to reality. Single and multiple scan tracks simulations were performed for Ti6Al4V alloy using a commercial CFD software, FLOW-3D AM®. The output from the numerical simulations was elaborated to obtain shape and size of melt pools, morphology of scan track surfaces and porosity content. In particular, a specific model was used in order to predict air entrainment in the melt pool and, therefore, to estimate gas porosity content, as an innovative approach to predict such defects. Results from simulations were compared with experimental data from Ti6Al4V samples produced by L-PBF in terms of melt pools size and morphology, as well as density. The good agreement between calculated and experimental results indicates that simulation of L-PBF can represent a powerful tool not only for the optimization of process parameters, but also for the prediction of porosity level. © 2022, The Author(s).","Additive Manufacturing; CFD; Gas porosity; Melt pool; Titanium alloy","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Computational fluid dynamics; Forecasting; Lakes; Morphology; Numerical models; Porosity; Powder metals; Ternary alloys; Experimental validations; Gas porosity; Laser powders; Melt pool; Model validation; Porosity contents; Powder bed; Scan track; Ti-6Al-4V alloy; Titanium (alloys); Titanium alloys","","","","","Università degli Studi di Brescia","Open access funding provided by Università degli Studi di Brescia within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.

Several parameters affect the quality of parts produced by FDM. This paper investigates the effect of FDM printing process parameters on tensile strength, impact strength, and flexural strength. The effects of process parameters such as printing speed, layer thickness, extrusion temperature, and infill percentage are studied. Polyactic acid (PLA) was used as a filament material for printing test specimens. The experimental layout is designed according to response surface methodology (RSM) and responses are collected. Specimens are prepared for testing of these parameters as per ASTM standards. A mathematical model for each of the responses is developed based on the nonlinear regression method. The desirability approach, nonlinear regression, as well as experimental values are in close agreement with each other. The desirability approach predicted the tensile strength, impact strength, and flexural strength with a less percentage error of 3.109, 6.532, and 3.712, respectively. The nonlinear regression approach predicted the tensile strength, impact strength, and flexural strength with a less percentage error of 2.977, 6.532, and 3.474, respectively. The desirability concept and nonlinear regression approach resulted in the best mechanical property of the FDM-printed part. © 2022 by the authors.","design of experiments; desirability concept; fused deposition modeling; nonlinear regression; response surface methodology","","","","","","","","Masood S.H., Advances in fused deposition modelling, Compr.

LPBF uses a laser heat source to melt a number of layer of powder particles and manufactures a part based on the CAD design. This work aims to assess the impact of Marangoni flow, buoyancy and recoil pressure to simulate the fluid flow around melt pool with a non-Gaussian laser beam to simulate the interaction between laser and powder bed. It was observed that velocity profile shows two peaks on either side of the highest temperature point owing to Marangoni convection on both sides due to gradient in surface tension. Dimensional analysis was also conducted based on Peclet number, Nusselt number and Marangoni number to determine the mode of heat transport at various laser power/scan speed combinations. Convective heat flow is the dominant form of heat transfer at higher energy input due to violent flow of the fluid and recoil pressure around the molten region, which can also create keyhole effect associated with defects such as porosities. The computational model was also validated by comparing solidified bead geometry with experimental data. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Dimensional analysis; Laser powder bed fusion; Melt pool flow; Metal additive manufacturing; Thermo-fluid multiphysics modeling","","","","","","","","Ali U., Fayazfar H., Ahmed F., Toyserkani E., Internal surface roughness enhancement of parts made by laser powder-bed fusion additive manufacturing, Vacuum, 177, (2020); Calignano F., Manfredi D., Ambrosio E.P., Iuliano L., Fino P., Influence of process parameters on surface roughness of aluminum parts produced by DMLS, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 67, 9-12, pp. 2743-2751, (2013); Mukherjee T., Manvatkar V., De A., DebRoy T., Dimensionless numbers in additive manufacturing, J Appl Phys, (2017); Rahman M.S., Schilling P.J., Herrington P.D., Chakravarty U.K., Thermofluid properties of Ti-6Al-4V melt pool in powder-bed electron beam additive manufacturing, J Eng Mater Technol Trans ASME, 141, 4, pp. 1-12, (2019); Masoomi M., Soltani-Tehrani A., Shamsaei N., Thompson S.M., Convection heat transfer coefficients for laser powder bed fusion, Solid Free.

The results show that the constitution of the second phase is large dependence on Fe content. With the Fe content increasing, the second phase can transform Al[sbnd]Fe phase to Fe and Al[sbnd]Fe phase. In addition, with increasing Fe content, the content of second phase increases gradually, while the content of pores also increases. We believe that with the Fe content increasing, the content of second phase with Fe element increases which the melt temperature is higher than sintering temperature, and the content of liquid phase decreases, that leading the high-viscosity liquid alloy cannot fill the pores fully and the more pores will remain and causes the relative density reduces. The compressive strength shows a parabola relationship with Fe content. Furthermore, adding Fe can accelerate the degradation of Mg alloys owing to the galvanic corrosion. The sample with 5 wt% Fe content shows the highest ultimate compressive strength (440 MPa) and fast degradation rate (9091 mm/Y), which meets the soluble Mg alloy with rare earth but cost much lower. © 2022","Binder jetting additive manufacturing;

In this study, we demonstrated that the keyhole pores formation in the laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing process can be significantly reduced by the constant laser power density scan strategy. The constant laser power density is implemented on a custom-built testbed by continuously varying the laser power with the laser scan speed through the time-stepped digital commands developed. Two cubic nickel alloy 625 parts of identical geometry were built, one with the constant laser power density scan strategy, and another with the conventional constant laser power scan strategy. The X-ray computed tomography (XCT) measurement shows a 67% porosity reduction in the part built with constant laser power density. However, the mechanisms for defect formation are not easily distinguishable in XCT, which gives a ‘total’ count of pores. To further investigate the effect of scan strategies on pore formation, two digital twins of process monitoring (DTPM), meltpool intensity volume (MPIV) and melt pool area volume (MAV), were created. The DTPM not only helps to distinguish the keyhole pores from the lack of fusion defects but also provides a foundation for the future development of machine learning models. © 2022","Digital twins; Keyhole pores; Scan strategies; X-ray computed tomography","3D printers; Additives; Computerized tomography; Defects; Nickel alloys; % reductions; Alloy 625; Keyhole pore; Laser powders; Laser power; Laser power density; Pore formation; Powder bed; Scan strategy; X-ray computed tomography; Process monitoring","","","","","","","Mani M., Lane B., Donmez A., Feng S., Moylan S., Fesperman R., Measurement Science Needs for Real-Time Control of Additive Manufacturing Powder Bed Fusion Processes, (2015); Grasso M., Colosimo B.M., Process defects and in situ monitoring methods in metal powder bed fusion: a review, Meas.

Currently, AM process monitoring mainly focuses on gaining an understanding of physical phenomena involved in a single quality indicator, ignoring the correlation between heterogeneous characteristics that can provide insight useful for accurate analysis. In this study, a multimodal Gaussian process methodology is designed to simultaneously quantify interactions between AM design parameters at play (e.g., orientation, thickness, height, and contour spacing) and heterogeneous quality characteristics (e.g., distortion, porosity, and roughness) when fabricating thin walls using AM. A real-world study is performed on Ti6Al4V thin wall structures fabricated with laser powder bed fusion, multiple design parameters are varied to evaluate the capability of the proposed method in quantifying such interactions. Experimental results using x-ray computed tomography show that the proposed multimodal Gaussian process provides an improvement of 21.7% compared to the single response model with respect to the root mean square error. The proposed methodology shows great potential to quantify heterogeneous characteristics of quality according to the process factors in a variety of AM builds, such as lattice and honeycomb structures. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Gaussian process; Heterogeneous defects; Quality characterization","","","","","","","","Imani F., Chen R., Diewald E., Reutzel E., Yang H., Deep learning of variant geometry in layerwise imaging profiles for additive manufacturing quality control, J.

The present research and development work aims to develop the proper parameter sets for pure Mo and its alloys, such as Mo-47.5Re wt% and characterize their microstructure and mechanical properties. Primary parameter optimization of the laser power, point distance, exposure time, and hatch distance were tested using a design of experiments to optimize the relative density of the specimens for the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) metal AM technology. Test specimens with relative densities of >98% were successfully fabricated for both pure Mo and Mo-47.5Re wt%. Mechanical testing and microstructural characterization were conducted on the specimens. Microcracking is present in both pure Mo and Mo-47.5Re wt%. Persistence of cracking in the Re containing alloy can be attributed to higher concentration of oxygen in the fabricated samples. A significant increase in strength and compressive ductility was observed in AM fabricated Mo-47.5Re wt% as compared to the pure Mo samples. Solidification texture randomization was also observed in Mo-47.5Re wt%, for which the underlying mechanism is not yet understood. This provides an encouraging outlook to continue testing and developing Mo and its alloys on a L-PBF platform with further stress reduction and material development strategies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Laser powder bed fusion; Molybdenum; Rhenium","Additives; Design of experiments; Fabrication; Mechanical testing; Molybdenum alloys; Powder metals; Textures; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Medical industries; Microstructural characterizations; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Parameter set; Powder bed; Pure molybdenum; Relative density; Research and development; 3D printers","","","","","","","Fang F., Zhou Y.Y., Yang W., In-situ SEM study of temperature dependent tensile behavior of wrought molybdenum, Int.

Effect of the filler wires on hydrogen pores, microstructures and mechanical properties of welded joints was studied. As a result, CMT welding of AlSi7Mg alloy sheets using ER5356 wire reduces the porosity, refines the grains, increases the fraction of high angle grain boundaries (HAGBs), modifies the eutectic Si-rich morphology, and improves the solid solution strengthening of Si elements in the α-Al matrix of the microstructures in the weld metal (WM). Additionally, the morphology of eutectic Si-rich phases in heat affected zone (HAZ) of the welded joint is noticeably changed from the continuous cellular networks in base metal (BM) to totally globularized particles, as a result of the increased welding heat effect with decreasing distance to the WM. Compared with the ER4047 wire, the welded joint with ER5356 wire achieves higher WM hardness and higher ultimate tensile strength (UTS), which have been increased by 13.9 % and 18.6 %, respectively.

The periodic input of energy required to melt the material can lead to an accumulation of heat, which increases the temperature of the part and changes the local temperature distribution in the melt pool. This heat accumulation results in local shape deviations of the part and can lead to inhomogeneous solidification conditions coinciding with inhomogeneous grain structures and potentially inhomogeneous mechanical properties or build failures. To produce high quality parts with homogeneous properties and to reduce unproductive dwell times, a comprehensive knowledge of the heat accumulation phenomena is required. The present work considers an explicit analytical description of the heat accumulation effect, which allows for a mathematical analysis of the influence of all contributing process parameters on the temperature increase of the part. The analytical equations were derived from simplified heat conduction equations and validated by comparison with temperature measurements from literature. The calculated temperature increase shows a good agreement with measurements observed during additive manufacturing of different materials and alloys in case of cladding or building volumes with direct energy deposition (DED) and laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Finally, the obtained analytical solution is used to derive optimization strategies aiming to reduce heat accumulation while simultaneously increasing productivity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Directed energy deposition; Heat accumulation; Laser cladding; Laser powder bed fusion; Residual temperature; Temperature evolution","3D printers; Additives; Deposition; Heat conduction; Powder metals; Additive manufacturing process; Directed energy; Directed energy deposition; Energy depositions; Heat accumulation; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; Residual temperature; Temperature evolution; Temperature measurement","","","","","Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung, AvH","This work was funded by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation within the framework of a Feodor-Lynen-Scholarship.

Effects of aging temperature and aging time on the microstructure, mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of the alloy were systematically studied. Results show that unique bimodal grain structure is formed in the as-printed and direct aging treated alloys, which is composed of fine equiaxed grains at the molten pool boundary and coarse columnar grains in the molten pool. Mechanical properties of the alloy can be improved by direct aging treatment, and the highest tensile strength reached 465 MPa. The precipitated Mg2Si and Al3(Er,Zr) with L12 structure play an important role in improving the mechanical properties. The precipitates and fraction of high-angle grain boundaries are important to evaluate the corrosion resistance of the investigated alloy. Considering the mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, the optimal aging process of the alloy studied in this paper is 150 °C × 4 h. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Aluminum alloy; Corrosion resistance; Heat treatment; Mechanical property; Selective laser melting","Aluminum alloys; Aluminum corrosion; Copper alloys; Copper corrosion; Corrosion resistant alloys; Corrosive effects; Grain boundaries; Heat resistance; Heat treatment; Intergranular corrosion; Magnesium alloys; Melting; Selective laser melting; Silicon alloys; Tensile strength; Textures; Zinc alloys; Zircaloy; Ageing treatments; Aging temperatures; Direct aging; Effect of ageing; Mechanical and corrosion properties; Mechanical property and corrosion resistance; Melting technology; Microstructure mechanical properties; Molten pool; Selective laser melting; Corrosion resistance","","","","","Cultivation Project of the State Key Laboratory of Green Development and High-value Utilization of Ionic Rare Earth Resources in Jiangxi Province, (20194AFD44003); Jiangxi University of Science and Technology, JUST, (JXUSTQJYX2020011); Jiangxi University of Science and Technology, JUST; National College Students Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program, (202210407025); National College Students Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program","This work is financially supported by the Cultivation Project of the State Key Laboratory of Green Development and High-value Utilization of Ionic Rare Earth Resources in Jiangxi Province ( 20194AFD44003 ), the Program of Qingjiang Excellent Young Talents , Jiangxi University of Science and Technology ( JXUSTQJYX2020011 ), and National College Students Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program of China ( 202210407025 ).","Zou Y., Wu X., Tang S., Et al., Investigation on microstructure and mechanical properties of Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys with various Zn/Mg ratios [J], J.

However, there is a need to understand the interactions between: (i) the material architecture, (ii) the AM process parameters, and (iii) the as-built geometry, microstructure and energy absorbing properties. In this work, we investigate the quasi-static and dynamic behaviour of cellular materials manufactured from 316L stainless steel using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Four cellular architectures are considered (octet lattice, lattice-walled square honeycomb, origami and square honeycomb), as well as three sets of AM process parameters, characterised by laser powers of 50, 125 and 200 W. The exposure time is adjusted to deliver the same total heat input. The 125 W case leads to material with the highest strength and ductility. The cellular materials with this process variant match their nominal densities most closely, and have the highest strength and energy absorption. Either reducing (50 W) or increasing (200 W) the power leads to a significant increase in porosity, reducing strength and energy absorption. However, we find that changes due to process-induced porosity have a smaller influence than those resulting from the choice of cellular architecture. © 2022 The Authors","316L stainless steel; Additive manufacturing; Architected materials; Cellular materials; Energy absorption; Laser powder bed fusion","3D printers; Additives; Architecture; Austenitic stainless steel; Cellular manufacturing; Honeycomb structures; Porosity; Strength of materials; 316 L stainless steel; Absorbing properties; Architected material; Cellular material; Energy; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Manufacturing process parameters; Metallic cellular materials; Powder bed; Energy absorption","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/R512461/1); European Space Agency, ESA, (NPI 565–2017)","M.

Existing soft crawling robots with specific structures have a single locomotion mode and cannot complete turning. Moreover, some silicone-based robots lack stiffness, leading to unstable movements especially when climbing walls, and have limited environmental adaptability. Therefore, in this study, a novel crawling soft robot with a multi-movement mode and high environmental adaptability is proposed. As the main structure of the robot, pneumatic single-channeled and double-channeled actuators are designed, inspired by the worm’s somite expansion and contraction. Model-based methods are employed to evaluate and analyze the characteristics of the actuators. By the application of selective laser sintering technology and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) material, the fabricated actuators with an auxetic cavity structure are able to maintain a certain stiffness. Via the coordination between the actuators and the suckers, two locomotion modes—straight-line and turning—are realized. In the testing, the speed of straight-line crawling was 7.15 mm/s, and the single maximum turning angle was 28.8 degrees. The testing verified that the robot could realize crawling on flat ground, slopes, and smooth vertical walls with a certain stability and equipment-carrying capacity. This research could lay the foundation for subsequent applications, including large tank interior inspections, civil aviation fuselage and wing inspections, and wall-cleaning in high-rise buildings. © 2022 by the authors.","bioinspired crawling robot; finite element analysis (FEA); pneumatic actuators; selective laser sintering (SLS) technology; soft robotics","","","","","","","","Lee C., Kim M., Kim Y.J., Hong N., Ryu S., Kim H.J., Kim S., Soft Robot Review, Int.

Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), the localisation of the GNP, as well as the morphology of PLA and PCL phases, were evaluated and correlated with the electrical conductivity results estimated by the four-point probe method electrical measurements. The solvent extraction method was used to confirm and quantify the co-continuity in these samples. At 10 wt.% of the GNP, compression-moulded samples possessed a wide co-continuity range, varying from PLA55/PCL45 to PLA70/PCL30. The best electrical conductivity results were found for compression-moulded and 3D-printed PLA65/PCL35/GNP that have the fully co-continuous structure, based on the experimental and theoretical findings. This composite owns the highest storage modulus and complex viscosity at low angular frequency range, according to the melt shear rheology. Moreover, it exhibited the highest char formation and polymers degrees of crystallinity after the thermal investigation by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), respectively. The effect of the GNP content, compression moulding time, and multiple twin-screw extrusion blending steps on the co-continuity were also evaluated. The results showed that increasing the GNP content decreased the continuity of the polymer phases. Therefore, this work concluded that polymer processing methods impact the electrical percolation threshold and that the 3D printing of polymer composites entails higher electrical resistance as compared to compression moulding. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing; bio nanocomposite blends; co-continuous structure; double electrical percolation; electrical conductivity; GNP; PCL; PLA","Calorimetry, Differential Scanning; Electric Conductivity; Graphite; Nanocomposites; Polymers; Blending; Compression molding; Crystallinity; Differential scanning calorimetry; Extrusion; Nanocomposites; Percolation (computer storage); Percolation (fluids); Scanning electron microscopy; Solvent extraction; Thermogravimetric analysis; graphite; nanocomposite; polymer; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Bio nanocomposite blend; Bio-nanocomposite; Co-continuous structure; Double electrical percolation; Electrical conductivity; Electrical percolation; Graphene nanoplatelets; Nanocomposite blends; Poly lactide; chemistry; differential scanning calorimetry; electric conductivity; Solvents","","graphite, 7782-42-5; Graphite, ; Polymers, ","","","Institut de Mathématiques de Toulouse, IMT","This research was funded by IMT Mines Ales.","Kuang T., Ju J., Chen F., Liu X., Zhang S., Liu T., Peng X., Coupled effect of self-assembled nucleating agent, Ni-CNTs and pressure-driven flow on the electrical, electromagnetic interference shielding and thermal conductive properties of poly (lactic acid) composite foams, Compos.

The development of additive manufacturing technology makes it easy and efficient to manufacture complex lattice structures. However, it has been found that excessively high stress concentration exists at the struts’ nodes during the compression of lattice structure. Therefore, three node strengthening strategies were proposed to reduce stress concentration, which were adding fillet at nodes, using circular arc transition and changing the angle of nodes. Firstly, lattice structures were manufactured by selective laser melting technique. The surface morphology of the lattice structures was observed by scanning electron microscopy. Then, the stress distribution and deformation mechanism of different lattice structures were investigated by quasi-static compression experiments and numerical simulation. Finally, the Gibson–Ashby model was adopted to predict lattice structures’ modulus and strength. And the energy absorptions of different structures were compared. The results revealed that the deformation mode of the optimized structures changed from shear failure to layer-by-layer collapse. Compared with the hourglass lattice structure and gradient lattice structure, the mechanical properties of curve lattice structure were improved the most. © 2022, The Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.","Deformation mode; Lattice structure; Node strengthening; Selective laser melting; Stress concentration","Additives; Deformation; Energy absorption; Melting; Morphology; Scanning electron microscopy; Selective laser melting; Struts; Surface morphology; Additive manufacturing technology; Deformation behavior; Deformation modes; Design and application; High stress concentration; Lattice structures; Mechanical energies; Node strengthening; Performance; Selective laser melting; Stress concentration","","","","","Science and Technology National Research and Development Plan of China National Railway Corporation, (N2020J027); Dalian Science and Technology Innovation Fund, (2019J11CY017)","This research was supported by the Science and Technology National Research and Development Plan of China National Railway Corporation (N2020J027) and the Science and Technology Innovation Fund Plan of Dalian (2019J11CY017).

This study aimed to investigate the adhesive property of a 3D-printed PEEK material. The effects of surface treatment and temporary crown materials on shear bond strength were evaluated. A total of 108 PEEK discs were 3D printed by fused-filament fabrication. Surface treatments, including sandblasting, abrasive paper grinding, and CO2 laser ablation, were applied to the PEEK discs, with the untreated specimens set as the control. Afterward, the surface topographies of each group were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, n = 1) and roughness measurements (n = 7). After preparing the bonding specimens with three temporary crown materials (Artificial teeth resin (ATR), 3M™ Filtek™ Supreme Flowable Restorative (FR), and Cool Temp NATURAL (CTN)), the shear bond strength was measured (n = 6), and the failure modes were analyzed by microscopy and SEM. The results showed that ATR exhibited a significantly higher shear bond strength compared to FR and CTN (p < 0.01), and the PEEK surfaces treated by sandblasting and abrasive paper grinding showed a statistically higher shear bond strength compared to the control (p < 0.05). For clinical application, the ATR material and subtractive surface treatments are recommended for 3D-printed PEEK abutments. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; dental implantology; fused filament fabrication; implant supported restoration; polyether ether ketone; rapid manufacturing; shear bond strength; temporary abutment","adhesive agent; polyetheretherketone; resin; Article; behavior change; fused deposition modeling; genetic screening; grinding; health care organization; health care personnel; health insurance; human; microscopy; questionnaire; scanning electron microscopy; stereolithography; three dimensional printing; topography","","polyetheretherketone, 31694-16-3","GraphPad Prism, Graphpad, United States","Graphpad, United States","Research and Development Program of West China Hospital of Stomatology Sichuan University, (RD-02-202114); West China School/Hospital of Stomatology Sichuan University, (RCDWJS2021-13); Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program, (2021YFS0085); Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (82101073); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2022M710253); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","This research was funded by Sichuan Science and Technology Program (No. 2021YFS0085), the Research and Development Program of West China Hospital of Stomatology Sichuan University (No. RD-02-202114), Research Funding from West China School/Hospital of Stomatology Sichuan University (No. RCDWJS2021-13), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 82101073), and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2022M710253).","Cosyn J., Eghbali A., De Bruyn H., Collys K., Cleymaet R., De Rouck T., Immediate Single-Tooth Implants in the Anterior Maxilla: 3-Year Results of a Case Series on Hard and Soft Tissue Response and Aesthetics: Immediate Single-Tooth Implants, J.

In this study, carbon (C) microalloying was employed to improve the room-temperature brittleness resistance of NbMoTaW RHEA fabricated using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). The addition of 0.5-at% C leads to good formability and remarkable microalloying effects. Nano-NbC precipitates distributed at grain boundaries and dislocations effectively refined the grain size. The yield strength, ultimate compression strength, and ductility were successfully improved up to 1725 MPa, 1782 MPa, and 7.0%, respectively. Nano-NbC carbide precipitates in the form of diffusion transformation during multiple reheating was verified by thermodynamics, kinetics calculations, and microstructure characterization. C microalloying endowed NbMoTaW RHEA with remarkable enhancements of strength and ductility, which suggested a strategy for designing strong and ductile RHEA through LPBF. © 2022","Carbon microalloying;

In this study, laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) was used to manufacture a high-performance Ni-superalloy heat pipe, through tailoring LPBF process parameters to fabricate thin wall and micro-channel. By using novel laser scanning strategies, wick structure heat pipes with maximised surface-area-to-volume ratio, fine features size around 100 µm, and controlled porosity were successfully fabricated. Microscopy and X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) were used to investigate the 3D structure of the void space within the pipe. Wick test results showed that most of the heat pipes made by LPBF had better performance than the conventionally manufactured pipes. This study also investigated the influences of the process parameters on the porosity volume fraction and the feature size. The results showed that LPBF process could fabricate thin structure due to the change of melt pool contact angle. The relationship between process parameters and bead size reported in this study could help design and manufacture heat pipe with complex fine structure. © 2022, The Author(s).","Heat pipe; Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF); Melt pool; Microtomography (micro-CT)","3D printers; Additives; Contact angle; Nickel alloys; Porosity; Superalloys; Fine structures; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Melt pool; Microtomography (micro-CT); Ni-superalloys; Performance; Powder bed; Process parameters; Heat pipes","","","","","Rolls-Royce; Innovate UK; Aerospace Technology Institute, ATI; University of Manchester; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/I02249X/1, EP/F007906/1, EP/F028431/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; Advanced Repair Technologies, (113015); Henry Royce Institute, (EP/R00661X/1, EP/P025498/1, EP/P025021/1); Henry Royce Institute","The authors would like to acknowledge Rolls-Royce plc, Aerospace Technology Institute, and Innovate UK for funding this research through the Advanced Repair Technologies (113015) programme.

However, conventional “one-size-fits-all” helmets may not be feasible for certain craniectomy defects. We describe the production and use of a custom 3D-printed helmet for a DC patient where a conventional helmet was not feasible due to the craniectomy defect configuration. Case presentation: A 65-year-old male with ethmoid sinonasal carcinoma underwent cranionasal resection and DC with free vastus lateralis flap reconstruction to treat cerebrospinal fluid leakage. He required an external helmet to protect the craniectomy site, however, the rim of a conventional helmet compressed the craniectomy site, and the straps compressed the vascular pedicle of the muscle flap. Computed topography (CT) scans of the patient’s cranium were imported into 3D modelling software and used to fabricate a patient-specific, strapless helmet using fused deposition modelling (FDM). The final helmet fit the patient perfectly and circumvented the compression issues, while also providing better cosmesis than the conventional helmet. Four months postoperatively, the helmet remains intact and in use. Conclusions: 3D printing can be used to produce low-volume, patient-specific external devices for rehabilitation where standardized adjuncts are not optimal. Once initial start-up costs and training are overcome, these devices can be produced by surgeons themselves to meet a wide range of clinical needs. © 2022, The Author(s).","3D printing; Decompressive craniectomy; Protective helmet; Skull defect","3D modeling; 3D printers; Accident prevention; Brain; Cerebrospinal fluid; Computerized tomography; Failure (mechanical); Magnetic resonance imaging; Patient rehabilitation; Safety devices; Topography; polyethylene; polylactide; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Case reports; Decompressive craniectomy; Defect configurations; Fluid leakage; Patient specific; Protective helmet; Sinonasal; Skull defect; aged; Article; blood vessel shunt; brain metastasis; cancer surgery; case report; clinical article; computer aided design; computer assisted tomography; daily life activity; decompressive craniectomy; digital imaging and communications in medicine; ethmoid sinus; fused deposition modeling; Glasgow coma scale; human; immobility; internal jugular vein; liquorrhea; lung cancer; male; muscle flap; neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy; paranasal sinus carcinoma; patient comfort; pedicled skin flap; physiotherapy; radial artery; resistance training; saphenous vein graft; self care; skull defect; vascular pedicle; vastus lateralis muscle; Defects","","polyethylene, 9002-88-4; polylactide, 26680-10-4","DITTO Pro; Meshmixer, Autodesk, United States; Spectra 3D","Autodesk, United States","","","Kurland D.B., Khaladj-Ghom A., Stokum J.A., Carusillo B., Karimy J.K., Gerzanich V., Sahuquillo J., Simard J.M., Complications associated with decompressive Craniectomy: a systematic review, Neurocrit Care, 23, 2, pp. 292-304, (2015); Honeybul S., Decompressive craniectomy: a new complication, J Clin Neurosci, 16, 5, pp. 727-729, (2009); Colasante C., Sanford Z., Castro N., Bartels M.N., Custom fabrication of a 3-dimensionally printed helmet for improved socialization and subjective self-assessment in a case of acquired cranial defect: a case presentation, PM R, 10, 6, pp. 671-674, (2018); Clarren S.K., Smith D.W., Hanson J.W., Helmet treatment for plagiocephaly and congenital muscular torticollis, J Pediatr, 94, 1, pp. 43-46, (1979); Goh J.L., Bauer D.F., Durham S.R., Stotland M.A., Orthotic (helmet) therapy in the treatment of plagiocephaly, Neurosurg Focus, 35, 4, (2013); Rahimy E., Skinner L., Kim Y.H., Hoppe R.T., Technical report: 3D-printed patient-specific scalp shield for hair preservation in total skin electron beam therapy, Tech Innov Patient Support Radiat Oncol, 18, pp. 12-15, (2021); Ge W., Wang Y., Ge K., Wu J., Fan J., Yang T., Wang Q., Xu B., Application of virtual reconstruction 3D-printed external fixation helmet in early functional treatment of facial fracture, J Shanghai Jiaotong University (Science), 26, 3, pp. 368-371, (2021); Lucano L.R.G., Brambila F.J.P., Perez J.E., Rosales P.H., Customized low-cost 3D printed helmet as a temporary measure for a patient with Acrania, Indian J Plast Surg, 52, 2, pp. 252-253, (2019); Humanitarian Device Exemption, (2019)","E.

Particular emphasis was paid to the crystallographic aspects of this process. The crystallization of δ-ferrite from the liquid phase was shown to be governed by an epitaxial mechanism which gave rise to the solidification 〈100〉 − fiber texture. The austenitic phase preferentially nucleated at the ferrite grain boundaries, while the subsequent migration of phase boundaries was accompanied by extensive annealing twinning. Remarkably, the grain-boundary austenite was related to both adjacent ferrite grains via the Nishiyama-Wasserman orientation relationship. The multiple crystallographic variants associated with the phase transformation and annealing twinning resulted in a comparatively weak 〈110〉 + <100> − fiber texture in austenite. The subsequent austenite → martensite phase transformation was governed by the mixed orientation relationship, which included both the Nishiyama-Wasserman and Kurdjumov-Sachs ones. The nearly-random texture in martensite suggested no essential variant selection during the phase transformation. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Additive manufacturing; Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD); Martensitic steel; Microstructure; Phase transformation; Texture","3D printers; Austenite; Ferrite; Grain boundaries; Martensite; Martensitic stainless steel; Martensitic transformations; Annealing twinnings; Electron back scatter diffraction; Electron backscatter diffraction; Fiber texture; Laser powders; Liquid phasis; Orientation relationship; Phases transformation; Powder bed; Textures","","","","","Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka, (075-15-2021-690, RF 2296.61321X0030); Belgorod National Research University, BelSU","This work was performed using the equipment of the Joint Research Center “Technology and Materials” at Belgorod National Research University (financial support from the Ministry of science and higher education of the Russian Federation under the agreement No. 075-15-2021-690 , the unique project identifier RF 2296.61321X0030).

Ideally, such hydrogel electronics should offer customizable three-dimensional circuits, but making complex three-dimensional circuits encapsulated within a hydrogel matrix is challenging with existing materials and manufacturing methods. Here we report the three-dimensional printing of hydrogel electronics using a curable hydrogel-based supporting matrix and a stretchable silver–hydrogel ink. The supporting matrix has a yield stress fluid behaviour, so the shear force generated by a moving printer nozzle creates a temporary fluid-like state, allowing the accurate placement in the matrix of silver–hydrogel ink circuits and electronic components. After printing, the entire matrix and embedded circuitry can be cured at 60 °C to form soft (Young’s modulus of less than 5 kPa) and stretchable (elongation of around 18) monolithic hydrogel electronics, whereas the conductive ink exhibits a high conductivity of around 1.4 × 103S cm−1. We use our three-dimensional printing approach to create strain sensors, inductors and biological electrodes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","3D printers; Medical applications; Silver; Yield stress; Biological tissues; Biomedical applications; Customizable; Fluid behavior; Hydrogel matrix; Manufacturing methods; matrix; Three-dimensional circuits; Three-dimensional-printing; Yield stress fluids; Hydrogels","","","","","Westlake Education Foundation; Westlake Laboratory of Life Sciences and Biomedicine; Westlake University; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (31970129, 51905446); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","We thank H.

Consideration has been given to the influence of TiB, TiB2, TiC, and B4C ceramic particles produced by in situ synthesis in the process of laser action on the microstructure and hardness of the formed metal-matrix composite. Basic mechanisms of variation in the microstructure to form secondary ceramic inclusions were discussed and microhardness measurements at a macro- and nanolevel were carried out. It has been established that ceramic particles formed as a result of the in-situ synthesis improve sharply the hardness of the metal-matrix composite depending on the composition of the ceramics. © 2022, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","additive technologies; boron carbide; CO<sub>2</sub>-laser; in situ and ex situ synthesis; microhardness; microstructure; nanohardness; Ti–6Al–4V","Aluminum compounds; Carbon dioxide lasers; Melting; Metallic matrix composites; Microhardness; Microstructure; Selective laser melting; Titanium carbide; Additive technology; Ceramics particles; CO 2 laser; In situ and ex situ synthesis; In-situ synthesis; Matrix composite; Metal matrix; Selective laser melting; Situ and ex situ synthesis; Ti–6al–4v; Boron carbide","","","","","","","Chen Z., Ziyong L., Junjie L., Et al., 3D printing of ceramics: A review, J.

Due to the inhibition effect of oxide layer, the interior multi-defects assisted facetted cracking becomes a significant failure mode. Large grain deformation mainly occurs on the fracture surface, and slip systems with high Schmid factor are activated by high-temperature. The precipitates in the matrix hinder the dislocation movement, resulting in dislocation accumulation and stress concentration increase, which makes it easier for microcracks initiation. The initiated microcracks with crack deflection caused by high angle grain boundaries propagate transgranularly to form a nearly circular region and undergo fast unstable growth, eventually leading to fracture. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Fatigue; High-temperature; Interior cracking behavior; Metals and alloys","Fatigue testing; Grain boundaries; High-cycle fatigue; Low-cycle fatigue; Melting; Metallurgy; Microcracks; Nickel alloys; Superalloys; Textures; Thermal fatigue; Analysis method; Cracking behavior; Highest temperature; Inhibition effect; Interior cracking behavior; Metals and alloys; Multi scale analysis; Ni-based superalloys; Selective laser melting; Very-High-Cycle Fatigue; Selective laser melting","","","","","State Key Laboratory of Powder Metallurgy in Central South University of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51775043, 52175128, U1864210); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 52175128 , U1864210 , 51775043 ) and State Key Laboratory of Powder Metallurgy in Central South University of China .","Panwisawas C., Tang Y.T., Reed R.C., Metal 3D printing as a disruptive technology for superalloys, Nat.

This work is distinguished by presenting a systematic study to optimize the mechanical properties of PLA, ABS and Nylon + carbon fiber (N + CF) parts manufactured by 3D fused deposition modeling (FDM) printing. To perform the optimization and statistical analysis of the effect of 3D printing parameters (geometric pattern, infill percentage, printing direction and the layer height) on ultimate tensile stress (UTS) and modulus of elasticity (E), two nk designs of experiments (DOE) were systematically applied. In this way, the printing parameters that maximize the UTS and those that are not significant for the three materials were defined which is the main contribution of this work. Additionally, a correlation analysis between density and UTS is presented (R2 =94.4 %). In the first DOE it was found that the material and the percentage of infill (33 %, 66 % and 100 %) are decisive factors in the impression; the geometric pattern (tridimensional, hexagonal and linear) is no longer relevant and is not considered in the following analysis. In a second DOE it was found that by decreasing the layer height from 0.18 mm to 0.14 mm and modifying the printing direction from 0°/90° to + 45°/− 45° there is an increase in the ultimate tensile stress (UTS) for all three materials. The specimen with the highest UTS reached 85 MPa, which was printed with N + CF linearly with 100 % infill, with 0.14 mm printing layer height and + 45°/− 45° in the printing direction. Through systematic analysis by DOE, it was possible to achieve higher UTS values than their own filaments in the case of N + CF and PLA by 49 % and 18 %, respectively, while for ABS its value is very close to the filament. In conclusion, an algorithm is presented to systematically analyze by DOE to evaluate the hypothesis of achieving a higher UTS than the filament for ABS, PLA and N + CF specimens manufactured by 3D printing. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3D printing; ABS; Design of experiments; Mechanical properties of 3D printed parts; Nylon with Carbon Fiber; PLA","Design of experiments; Fused Deposition Modeling; Infill drilling; Polyamides; Rayon; Tensile stress; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; ABS; Geometric patterns; Mechanical characteristics; Mechanical property of 3d printed part; Nylon with carbon fiber; PLA; Properties optimizations; Ultimate tensile stress; Carbon fibers","","","","","","","Medellin-Castillo H.I., Zaragoza-Siqueiros J., Design and manufacturing strategies for fused deposition modelling in additive manufacturing: a review, Chin.

The present study demonstrates the possibility of microstructure modification via process parameter variation on a Fe-Mn-Si based shape memory alloy fabricated by laser powder bed fusion. By varying the scan speed, samples characterized by coarse elongated grains with strong <001> orientation along the build direction or by finer equiaxed grains without preferential orientation can be fabricated. Changes in the volume phase fraction of bcc-δ ferrite and fcc-γ austenite are also introduced by selective Mn evaporation.

Here, we address this limitation in an exemplary additively manufactured Ni-base superalloy, AM IN738LC, by converting the fine as-printed grain structure to a coarse columnar one via directional recrystallization. The directional recrystallization behaviors of AM IN738LC were characterized through a parameter study in which the peak temperature and draw rate were each independently varied. Recrystallization began when the peak temperature was higher than the γ′ solvus of 1183 °C. Varying the draw rate from 1 to 100 mm/hr while maintaining a fixed peak temperature of 1235 °C and a thermal gradient of order 105 °C/m ahead of the hot zone showed that a draw rate of 2.5 mm/hr maximized the grain size, giving a mean longitudinal grain size of 650 µm. Specimens processed under these optimal conditions also inherited the 〈100〉 fiber texture of the as-printed material. Close inspection of a quenched specimen revealed Zener pinning of the longitudinal grain boundaries by MC carbides and a discrete primary recrystallization front whose position followed the γ′ solvus isotherm. The present results demonstrate for the first time how directional recrystallization of additively manufactured Ni-base superalloys can achieve large columnar grains, manipulate crystallographic texture to minimize thermal stresses expected in service, and functionally grade the grain structure to selectively enhance fatigue or creep performance. © 2022 The Authors","Grain growth; Heat treatment; Laser powder bed fusion; Recrystallization; Superalloys","Additives; Carbides; Creep; Crystal microstructure; Fatigue of materials; Grain boundaries; Grain size and shape; Nickel alloys; Recrystallization (metallurgy); Superalloys; Textures; Additive manufacturing process; Grainsize; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Metal additives; Ni-base superalloys; Peak temperatures; Powder bed; Printed materials; Recrystallisation; Grain growth","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2020307609); National Science Foundation, NSF; Office of Naval Research, ONR, (N00014–22-1–2036); Office of Naval Research, ONR; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, UIUC","This work was supported by a grant from the Office of Naval Research (contract no.

The effect of common L-PBF process parameters, such as laser power, scanning speed, and hatch spacing, have been reported in many literature studies. However, one important factor that has not been investigated is the laser scan strategy, or the path that the laser follows within each layer. This is a particularly important factor to investigate in the case of NiTi SMAs that tend to be more sensitive to thermal histories than other commercial AM materials. For example, even slight variations in thermal history might exhibit notable influence on transformation behavior due to composition changes resulting from differential evaporation of nickel. The current work presents a first investigation on such effects of 12 laser scan strategy on the fabrication outcome of additively manufactured Ni-rich NiTi SMAs. The extent of warping deformation and surface morphology of fabricated parts with different scan strategies were found to show notable differences. Some phase transformation variations among different scan strategies were also identified in as-fabricated and solution heat treated conditions, although these variations were not as pronounced as variations in warping due to residual stresses and surface morphology. This study guides the selection of scan strategies such that build failures due to excessive warping and poor surface morphology are minimized. It also provides additional flexibility in controlling mechanical properties and phase transformation behavior of this relatively difficult-to-process class of materials. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Additive manufacturing (AM); Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF); NiTi; Phase transformation; Scan strategy; Shape memory alloy (SMA); Warping deformation","3D printers; Additives; Binary alloys; Deformation; Fabrication; Morphology; Phase transitions; Shape-memory alloy; Surface morphology; Titanium alloys; Additive manufacturing; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Nickel-titanium shape memory alloys; Phases transformation; Powder bed; Scan strategy; Shape memory alloy; Transformation behavior; Warping deformations; Nickel alloys","","","","","Schlumberger Foundation; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1846676)","The co-authors thank the support from National Science Foundation (NSF) through Grant No. 1846676 .

Simulation of AM chain provides means to effectively optimize the final product's quality characteristics in the design stage. The present study developed theoretical models for simulation of surface topography and roughness of parts produced by the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process and their evolution after burnishing as post-treatment. The simulation algorithm has been integrated by combining principles of LPBF process, i.e., formation of the melt pool and kinematic of motion, as well as the fundamental theorem of multi-roller rotary burnishing process, i.e., Z-map approach and mechanic of elastic rebound of the surface. This simulation allows the surface topography and roughness to be controlled by adjusting both sequential processes' parameters in a short period with acceptable accuracy. To verify the simulation results, 316L stainless steel was fabricated by an EOS GmbH printing machine and then burnished under different processing conditions. 3D surface profile and surface roughness of as-printed material and those post-processed by burnishing were measured through microscopic examination and surface roughness measurement, respectively. The results obtained through comparison of confirmatory experiments and simulation model affirmed that the proposed approach is accurate enough to predict the surface topography and roughness of as-printed and post-treated samples. The proposed integrated simulation framework has been further utilized to identify how the parameters included in the chain of additive manufacturing and sequential post-processing contribute to achieving nanoscale surface finish in the design stage. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Burnishing;

Nonetheless, this method faces challenges in retaining the shape fidelity of the 3D-bioprinted structure, i.e., the collapse of filament (bioink) due to gravity and/or spreading of the bioink owing to the low viscosity, ultimately complicating the fabrication of multi-layered designs that can maintain the desired pore structure. While low viscosity is required to ensure a continuous flow of material (without clogging), a bioink should be viscous enough to retain its shape post-printing, highlighting the importance of bioink properties optimization. Here, two quantitative analyses are performed to evaluate shape fidelity. First, the filament collapse deformation is evaluated by printing different concentrations of alginate and its crosslinker (calcium chloride) by a co-axial nozzle over a platform to observe the overhanging deformation over time at two different ambient temperatures. In addition, a mathematical model is developed to estimate Young’s modulus and filament collapse over time. Second, the printability of alginate is improved by optimizing gelatin concentrations and analyzing the pore size area. In addition, the biocompatibility of proposed bioinks is evaluated with a cell viability test. The proposed bioink (3% w/v gelatin in 4% alginate) yielded a 98% normalized pore number (high shape fidelity) while maintaining >90% cell viability five days after being bioprinted. Integration of quantitative analysis/simulations and 3D printing facilitate the determination of the optimum composition and concentration of different elements of a bioink to prevent filament collapse or bioink spreading (post-printing), ultimately resulting in high shape fidelity (i.e., retaining the shape) and printing quality. © 2022 by the authors.","alginate; bioink; bioprinter; extrusion; gelatin; shape fidelity","alginic acid; bioink; calcium chloride; chemical compound; gelatin; hydrogel; unclassified drug; Article; biocompatibility; bioprinting; cell viability; experimental test; filament deformation test; flow kinetics; flow rate; human; image analysis; mathematical model; oscillation; quantitative analysis","","alginic acid, 28961-37-7, 29894-36-8, 9005-32-7, 9005-38-3; calcium chloride, 10043-52-4; gelatin, 9000-70-8","AR-G2; AXIO, Carl Zeiss; H220-H; NE-4000, New Era Pump Systems, United States","Carl Zeiss; New Era Pump Systems, United States","Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu, TÜBİTAK; Bilim Kahramanlari Dernegi; Turkish Ministry of National Education; Bilim Akademisi; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (101003361); Royal Academy, (120N019); Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung, AvH, (101003361)","S.T. acknowledges Tubitak 2232 International Fellowship for Outstanding Researchers Award (118C391), Alexander von Humboldt Research Fellowship for Experienced Researchers, Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Individual Fellowship (101003361), and Royal Academy Newton-Katip \u00C7elebi Transforming Systems Through Partnership award (120N019) for financial support of this research.

The as-built microstructures of the studied materials differed by their grain size, their grain boundary character distributions, and their populations of nanoprecipitates. Strong differences in their recrystallization kinetics were observed; they were attributed to a delayed nucleation in the steel exhibiting the finer grains, the lower density of low-angle boundaries (LAB), and the higher volume fraction of precipitates. This work shows that a high density of LABs stemming from the solidification stage in the LPBF process promotes recrystallization by locally increasing the stored energy close to grain boundaries, and hence the formation of recrystallization nuclei. The design of low-LAB microstructures could thus lead to higher stability at high temperatures. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","316 L stainless steel; Laser powder bed fusion; Nucleation; Recrystallization; Solidification microstructure","Austenitic stainless steel; Grain boundaries; Kinetics; Precipitation (chemical); Recrystallization (metallurgy); Solidification; 316 L stainless steel; Grain boundary character distributions; Grainsize; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Low angle boundaries; Powder bed; Recrystallisation; Recrystallization kinetics; Solidification microstructures; Nucleation","","","","","Électricité de France, EDF SA; Electricité de France, EDF","The authors would like to thank Électricité de France (EDF) for its contribution to the financial support of this study.

However, the biological inertness of 3D-printed Ti-6Al-4V implant surface limits its further clinical application. This paper aims to improve the biocompatibility of 3D-printed Ti-6Al-4V implants through multi-scale composite structure and bioactive coating. The samples are prepared by selective laser melting (SLM). The multi-scale composite structure is constructed by acid etching and anodic oxidation, and then the bioactive coating is added by hydrothermal treatment. The results indicate that acid etching removes the residuals on the surface and builds micron-/sub-micron structures. Anodic oxidation superimposes TiO2 nanotube arrays with a diameter of ≈80 nm, forming the multi-scale composite structure. The polydopamine-magnesium ion coating is added by hydrothermal treatment on the basis of retaining the multi-scale composite structure. After modification, the surface wettability and corrosion resistance are improved, and the roughness is slightly reduced. Regarding the biocompatibility of the modified 3D-printed Ti-6Al-4V implant, its admirable osteogenic induction performance is verified on osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1). Also, the addition of magnesium ions achieves better antibacterial properties. The results provide new target points for the surface modification of 3D-printed Ti-6Al-4V implant to attain better clinical performance. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","3D-printed Ti-6Al-4V implants; biocompatibility; magnesium ions; multi-scale composite structures; polydopamine","3D printers; Aluminum alloys; Aluminum coatings; Anodic oxidation; Corrosion resistance; Etching; Magnesium; Metal implants; Metal ions; Structure (composition); Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Titanium dioxide; Vanadium alloys; 3d-printed ti-6al-4v implant; Acid-etching; Bioactive coatings; Composites structures; Hydrothermal treatments; Magnesium ions; Multi-scale composite structure; Multi-scale composites; Osteogenesis; Polydopamine; Biocompatibility","","","","","Advanced Medical Research Institute of Shandong University; Key Research and Development Project of Jining City, (2021DZP005); Major Industrial Research Projects in Shandong Province, (2021‐13); Key Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong, (2020JMRH0202); Key Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51975336, 52172282); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2021M690106); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51975336, 52172282), Key Research and Development Program of Shandong Province (2020JMRH0202), Project funded by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2021M690106), Major Industrial Research Projects in Shandong Province for the Conversion of Old and New Kinetic Energy (2021‐13) and Key Research and Development Project of Jining City (2021DZP005).

They originate by liquefaction of the vitreous and result in visual field distortions. In some cases, the patient discomfort is so severe that surgical removal is required, with the risk of consequent complications. However, floaters have yet to be fully studied and understood in the way and time they originate. The introduction of 3D printing boosted the development of new tools for scientific research such as bio-models. Bio-model applications range from surgical training to implants fabrication. Several models are also bioprinted as rigid scaffolds or bio inks containing living cells. Medical implants are often produced by Stereolithography (SLA) to build complex geometries and meet the desired mechanical properties with high-dimensional accuracies. This paper focuses on the optimization of the printing parameters of an SLA structure to obtain a scaffold with the required characteristic for a proper 3D cell culture and investigation. The model will be the starting point for a future study regarding the etiology and formation mechanism of eye floaters in cell culture. The studied 3D printing parameters are layer thickness, exposure time, and light blocker content added to a biocompatible resin. Due to the final application, the main required property of the scaffold is transparency that allows visual inspection under optical microscope. The selected samples showed a good biocompatibility and visibility under optical microscope, both promising results for long-term cell cultures. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","3D Printing; Eye floaters; Eye model; Stereolithography","","","","","","","","Lumi X., Hawlina M., Glavac D., Et al., Ageing of the vitreous: from acute onset floaters and flashes to retinal detachment, Ageing Res Rev, 21, pp. 71-77, (2015); Milston R., Madigan M.C., Sebag J., Vitreous floaters: etiology, diagnostics, and management, Surv Ophthalmol, 61, pp. 211-227, (2016); Broadhead G.K., Hong T., Chang A.A., To treat or not to treat: management options for symptomatic vitreous floaters, Asia Pac J Ophthalmol, 9, pp. 96-103, (2020); Kalavar M., Hubschman S., Hudson J., Et al., Evaluation of available online information regarding treatment for vitreous floaters, Semin Ophthalmol, 36, 1-2, pp. 58-63, (2021); Cipolletta S., Beccarello A., Galan A., A psychological perspective of eye floaters, Qual Health Res, 22, 11, pp. 1547-1558, (2012); Kokavec J., Wu Z., Sherwin J.C., Et al., Nd:YAG laser vitreolysis versus pars plana vitrectomy for vitreous floaters, Cochrane Database Systc Rev Issue, (2017); Ryan E.H., Current treatment strategies for symptomatic vitreous opacities, Curr Opin Ophthalmol, 32, 13, pp. 198-202, (2021); Fenton O.S., Paolini M., Andresen J., Et al., Outlooks on three-dimensional printing for ocular biomaterials research, J Ocul Pharmacol Ther, 36, (2020); Yap Y.L., Tan Y.S.E., Tan H.K.J., Et al., 3D printed bio-models for medical applications, Rapid Prototyp J, 23-2, pp. 227-235, (2017); Sedlak J., Vocilka O., Slany M., Et al., Design and production of eye prosthesis using 3D printing, MM Sci J, (2020); Xie P., Hu Z., Zhang X., Et al., Application of 3-dimensional printing technology to construct an eye model for fundus viewing study, PLoS One, (2014); Phan C.M., Shukla M., Walther H., Et al., Development of an in vitro blink model for ophthalmic drug deliver, Pharmaceutics, (2021); Lobo D.A., Ginestra P.S., Cell bioprinting: the 3D-bioplotter™ case, Materials, 12, 23, (2019); Kupfer M.E., Lin W.H., Ravikumar V., Et al., In situ expansion, differentiation, and electromechanical coupling of human cardiac muscle in a 3D bioprinted, chambered organoid, Circ Res, 127, pp. 207-224, (2020); Sommer A.C., Blumenthal E.Z., Implementations of 3D printing in ophthalmology, Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol, 257, pp. 1815-1822, (2019); Ferraro R.M., Ginestra P.S., Lanzi G., Et al., Production of micro-patterned substrates to direct human iPSCs-derived neural stem cells orientation and interaction, Procedia CIRP, 65, pp. 225-230, (2017); Ginestra P.S., Pandini S., Ceretti E., Hybrid multi-layered scaffolds produced via grain extrusion and electrospinning for 3D cell culture tests, Rapid Prototyp J, 26, 3, pp. 593-602, (2020); StaAgueda J.R.H., Chen Q., Maalihan R.D., Et al., 3D printing of biomedically relevant polymer materials and biocompatibility, MRS Communications, (2021); Schmidleithner C., Kalaskar D.M., Stereolithography, 3D Printing, (2018); Kress S., Schaller-Ammann R., Feiel J., Et al., 3D printing of cell culture devices: assessment and prevention of the cytotoxicity of photopolymers for stereolithography, Materials, (2020)","L.

The scope of this paper is to redesign a manufacturing process for complex aircraft components using wing ribs as example by considering embedded Internet of Things (IoT) sensory capability that can be used in an Industry 4.0 ecosystem for moving away from a condition-based preventive maintenance system to a data-driven predictive maintenance-based system. This work is based on a previous study that considered the part design stage which deals with finding the best design solution for a single part. Considering a wing rib geometry of 3-mm web thickness with 6-mm upper and lower caps, the manufacturing process is designed and assessed using the Simufact Additive™ software. The use of AM when embedding IoT sensors allows more flexibility without compromising the structural integrity of parts, as well as the advantage of design freedom and limited cost when modifying geometries. The outcomes show that the manufacturing process depends strongly on hot isostatic pressing (HIP) for the wing rib, but for the sensory covers it presented no significant improvement. The results also show that the support optimisation can lead to an important reduction of mass and volume as well as an improvement of the structural performance. © 2022, The Author(s).","Aircraft wing rib; AM; IoT; Metal powder bed fusion; Predictive maintenance; Simufact Additive™","3D printers; Hot isostatic pressing; Internet of things; Powder metals; Preventive maintenance; Wings; Additive manufacturing process; Aircraft components; Aircraft wing rib; Manufacturing process; Manufacturing process design; Metal additives; Metal powder bed fusion; Powder bed; Predictive maintenance; Simufact additive™; Additives","","","","","University of Strathclyde","The authors acknowledge the support of the University of Strathclyde, UK.

Results demonstrated that α laths with their elongation directions 45° to the tensile loading axis and α laths with the larger thickness could induce severe strain accumulation during the uniaxial tensile process. Crystallographic orientations and grain morphologies of α lath were considered the key factors that could influence the deformation behavior. The strain localization was observed in the α laths dominated by multiple slip systems. Furthermore, the α laths with their elongation directions 45° to the tensile loading axis had the longest effective slip length, which could make α laths favorable for deformation. The dislocations multiplication of coarse α laths was much greater than in fine α laths, which could also result in strain localization. These findings could shed light on the deformation behavior related to lamellar structure in LPBF Ti64 and could further help the mechanical property manipulation. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Deformation; In-situ SEM tensile testing; Laser powder bed fusion; Microstructure; Ti-6Al-4V","Deformation; Lamellar structures; Tensile stress; Tensile testing; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Deformation behavior; In-situ SEM; In-situ SEM tensile testing; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Loading axis; Powder bed; Strain localizations; Tensile loading; Ti-6al-4v; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Sailing Program, (20YF1431600)","The authors acknowledge financial support from the Sailing Program ( 20YF1431600 ).

The outstanding benefit of laser cladding is that the cladding process is more flexible and it can be completed in an open environment. However, oxidation phenomenon of active metals such as titanium alloys will unavoidably clad in the open environment. To solve this problem, a three-layer annular coaxial shroud (TACS) has been designed using computational approach and evaluated by experimental data. A four-stream nozzle of gas-powder computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was established by employing Euler-Lagrange framework to analyze the powder feeding process. Simulation results show that when the velocities of inner-layer gas of TACS and carrier gas are equal, the powder stream exhibits the best concentration within molten pool area due to the formation of the stable laminar powder stream. When the flared angle of outer-layer gas equals 45°, the vortex toroidal flow moves away from the molten pool and the argon fills in the entire cladding region to form a high-quality barrier. The optimized parameters of TACS have been applied to the practical coaxial laser cladding of Ti-6Al-4V (TC4). A single-track cladding sample with lower height to width ratio and lower wetting angle can be observed due to the flattening of the shielding gas. The oxidation is greatly reduced. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Laser cladding; Numerical simulation; Three-layer annular coaxial shroud (TACS); Titanium alloys","Aluminum alloys; Carrier concentration; Computational fluid dynamics; Gases; Laser cladding; Metals; Numerical models; Powder metals; Active metals; Experimental investigations; Gas-powder flows; Metal additives; Molten pool; Open environment; Powder stream; Three-layer; Three-layer annular coaxial shroud; Titanium (alloys); Titanium alloys","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51475174); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Huaqiao University, HQU","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [ 51475174 ] and Subsidized Project for Postgraduates' Innovative Fund in Scientific Research of Huaqiao University .","Dai X., Xie H., Constitutive parameter identification of 3D printing material based on the virtual fields method, Mea., 59, pp. 38-43, (2015); Herzog D., Seyda V., Wycisk E., Emmelmann C., Additive manufacturing of metals, Acta Mater., 117, pp. 371-392, (2016); Malin V., Johnson R., Sciam M., Laser cladding helps refurbish US navy ship component, AMPTIAC Quart., 8, pp. 3-9, (2005); Uriondo A., Esperon-Miguez M., Perinpanayagam S., The present and future of additive manufacturing in the aerospace sector: a review of important aspects, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering, 229, pp. 2132-2147, (2015); Yadroitsev I., Krakhmalev P., Yadroitsava I., Selective laser melting of Ti6Al4V alloy for biomedical applications: temperature monitoring and microstructural evolution, J.

However, during 3D printing of holes and nozzle elements, difficulties arise with reducing their diameter. Therefore, this article conducts a comprehensive study of the Bernoulli gripping device prototype with a cylindrical nozzle, manufactured by fused deposition modeling 3D printing. The three main reasons for reducing the diameter of the gripper nozzle after printing were due to the poor-quality model, excessive extrusion of plastic in the middle of the arc printing path, and linear shrinkage of printing material after cooling. The proposed methodology consisted of determining the three coefficients that allowed the determination of the diameter of the designed nozzle. The use of air pressure distributions on the surface of the manipulation object, and lifting forces of gripping devices with different 3D printing layer heights were found. It was experimentally determined that as the height of the printing layer increased, the lifting force decreased. This was due to the formation of swirls due to the increased roughness of the grip surface. It was proven that as the height between the manipulation object and the grip increased, the effect of surface roughness on the lifting force decreased, resulting in an increase in the lifting force. Determination of the rational operating parameters of gripping devices manufactured by 3D printing from the point of view of maximum lifting force, were determined. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing; Bernoulli gripping device; fused deposition modeling; grasping; nozzle; prototyping; robotics","","","","","","U.S. Department of State, DOS; Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, ECA; , (951813); Easthampton City Arts, ECA, (-1-00005, 824964, PS00322778)","This work was supported in part by the U.S. Department of State (DOS), Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA), Exchange Visitor Program #G-1-00005 under Fulbright Grant PS00322778; by the projects DIH2 ID: 824964 and Better Factory ID: 951813.","Gibson I., Rosen D., Stucker B., Khorasani M., Additive Manufacturing Technologies, 17, (2014); Calignano F., Manfredi D., Ambrosio E.P., Biamino S., Lombardi M., Atzeni E., Salmi A., Minetola P., Iuliano L., Fino P., Overview on additive manufacturing technologies, Proc.

We exploit a stereolithography apparatus (SLA)-type 3-D printer to fabricate tapered dielectric samples. This technology eliminates the costly and complicated processes (e.g., perforation and etching) that are required in the fabrication of tapered dielectric structures. Specifically, we adopt the rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) technique to extract the effective permittivity (EP) of a tapered dielectric unit structure. An optimization algorithm is employed to determine the ultimate optimal design parameters for the maximum transmittance. The free-space measurement is performed to evaluate the electromagnetic (EM) performance of designed samples. We demonstrate that a 2-D array of optimized tapered dielectric unit structures can exhibit enhanced transmission property in comparison to a half-wavelength dielectric layer and tapered dielectric structure without optimization, viz. above 60% transmittance over the entire Ka-band up to 60° of the incidence angle for both transverse electric (TE) and magnetic polarizations. © 2022 IEEE.","3-D printer; broadband and wide-incident-angle transmission; dielectric radome; Ka-band; tapered dielectric","3D printers; Dielectric materials; Fabrication; Permittivity; Printing presses; Structural optimization; 2D-arrays; Broadband and wide-incident-angle transmission; Broadband Communication; Dielectric radome; Dielectric structure; Impedance; Incident angles; Ka band; Tapered dielectric; Unit structure; Substrates","","","","","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2020R1A2B5B01002251, 2021R1A4A1030775); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion, IITP, (2022-0-00704-001)","This work was supported in part by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) under Grant 2020R1A2B5B01002251, in part by the NRF Grant through the Korea Government (MSIT) under Grant 2021R1A4A1030775, and in part by the Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) Grant through the Korea Government (MSIT) under Grant 2022-0-00704-001 (Development of 3D-NET Core Technology for High-Mobility Vehicular Service).","Shin H., Yoon D., Na D.-Y., Park Y.B., Analysis of radome cross section of an aircraft equipped with a FSS radome, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 33704-33712, (2022); Munk B.A., Frequency Selective Surfaces: Theory Design, (2000); Sun M., Bie S., Miao L., Chen Q., Jiang J., An angular stabilized frequency selective surface by using capacitance layers structure, Prog.

In the proposed strategy, a specific length of scanning line without laser energy was added to each short scanning line, making each scanning line of the same length. The temperature simulation results of 1 mm thin-walled specimen indicated that the conventional scanning strategy could easily drive a harsh increase in peak temperature, further leading to a harsh increase in melt pool size. After applying the optimized scanning strategy, the peak temperature and melt pool size of the 1 mm thin-walled specimen were almost similar to those of the standard specimen. Meanwhile, the corresponding experiments indicated that the average surface roughness and hardness of 1 mm thin-walled case processed by conventional scanning was Ra70 and 320 HV10. The deformation and bumpy area could be observed on the surface, the porosity was high, and the grain size tended to be larger. After optimization, the average surface roughness was decreased to Ra37 and the hardness was increased to 370 HV10. In addition, the above metallurgical defects were greatly reduced. The above scanning strategy was integrated into the self-developed LPBF equipment and manufacturing process, and the thin-walled blade model was processed to verify the feasibility of the optimized scanning strategy for complex parts. Since the scanning strategy is independent of material and process parameters, it is beneficial to improve the process and quality stability of LPBF manufacturing complex parts. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Heat accumulation; Laser powder bed fusion; Optimized scanning strategy; Short scanning lines","Additives; Hardness; Scanning; Surface roughness; Thin walled structures; Heat accumulation; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Optimized scanning strategy; Peak temperatures; Powder bed; Scanning lines; Scanning strategies; Short scanning line; Thin-walled; 3D printers","","","","","Hubei Province Provincial Teaching Research Project of Higher Education Institution, (2020092); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51905193, 52201040, 52275333); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2021M701291, 2022TQ0110); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2021yjsCXCY010, 2021yjsCXCY056); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 52275333 , 52201040 , 51905193 ), the Hubei Province Provincial Teaching Research Project of Higher Education Institution ( 2020092 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( 2021yjsCXCY010 , 2021yjsCXCY056 ), the Project funded by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation ( 2021M701291 , 2022TQ0110 ).","Li J., Cheng T., Liu Y., Yang Y., Li W., Wei Q., Simultaneously enhanced strength and ductility of Cu-15Ni-8Sn alloy with periodic heterogeneous microstructures fabricated by laser powder bed fusion, Addit.

AM with selective laser melting is adopted to fabricate a lab-scale rapid cooling die filled with conformal lattice structures, which provide structural stiffness, act as thermal fins, and expedite the occurrence of turbulent flow in the channel. Three different surface area densities with the same relative volume density were considered to evaluate the heat transfer and cooling performance. Computational fluid dynamics is used to analyze the flow of coolant in the lattice structures with different surface area densities. The experimental and computational results show that if the surface density of the lattice structure is selected properly, the cooling performance can be enhanced significantly while maintaining a constant relative volume density, which directly affects the weight reduction and stiffness of the cooling die. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Korean Society for Precision Engineering.","Additive manufacturing; Conformal cooling channel; Hot stamping; Lattice structures","Computational fluid dynamics; Cooling; Forging machines; Selective laser melting; Stamping; Stiffness; Area density; Conformal cooling channels; Cooling die; Cooling performance; Design Principles; Hot-stamping; Lattice structures; Selective laser melting; Surface area; Volume density; Additives","","","","","Ministry of Education, MOE, (2021RIS-003); Ministry of Education, MOE; Korea Institute of Industrial Technology, KITECH, (2000014); Korea Institute of Industrial Technology, KITECH; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This result was supported by ""Regional Innovation Strategy (RIS)"" through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (MOE) (2021RIS-003); This work was also partially funded by KITECH Project #EO2000014.

The heat treatment temperatures are 750 °C, 850 °C, and 950 °C. The three temperatures are kept for 2 h, and then air cooling (AC) is used for treatment. Observe the changes in microstructure, phase composition, hardness, and tensile properties. The results show that the existence of defects will not affect the overall change trend of the microstructure, hardness and phase composition of the Ti-6Al-4V sample after heat treatment. However, there are obvious changes in the surrounding of two kinds of defects, which are the surface defects with large area and the lack of fusion (LOF) defects that are communicated with the outside world and extend to the inside of the sample. These two types of defects water, oil and air are easy to enter, and the defects are not easy to remove, heating will produce a large amount of hydrogen. Hydrogen enters the sample through defects, resulting in a large number of β phase around the two types of defects, and white around the defects. The hardness near the defect decreased significantly, and the closer the distance, the more the hardness decreased. A large amount of hydrogen entered into the Ti-6Al-4V sample, resulting in the appearance of new phase δ phase in the phase composition, resulting in the decrease of tensile strength（TS）and yield strength (YS) of the tensile properties after heat treatment, and the obvious decrease of elongation (EL). Moreover, among the various defects, the most important influence on the phase composition and tensile properties is the LOF defect that communicates with the outside world and extends to the inside of the sample. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Defects; Heat treatment; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; SLMed-Ti-6Al-4V alloy","Hardness; Heat treatment; Hydrogen; Melting; Microstructure; Phase composition; Surface defects; Tensile strength; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; 950° C; After-heat treatment; Air cooling; Fusion defects; Heat treatment temperature; Large amounts; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Selective laser melting; SLMed-ti-6al-4v alloy; Three temperature; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Shanghai Local Universities Capacity Building Project of Science and Technology Innovation Action Program, (20030500900); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM, (21DZ2294200); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM","Funding text 1: This study work was funded by Shanghai Local Universities Capacity Building Project of Science and Technology Innovation Action Program (20030500900).

Observing that different frames and different points in point cloud sequences often have different importance values for the 3D action recognition task, in this work, we propose a fully automatic model compression framework called 3D-Pruning (3DP) for efficient 3D action recognition. After performing model compression by using our 3DP framework, the compressed model can process different frames and different points in each frame by using different computational complexities based on their importance values, in which both the importance value and computational complexity for each frame/point can be automatically learned. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our 3DP framework for model compression.  © 2022 IEEE.","3D action recognition; Efficient deep learning; model compression; point cloud","Computer vision; Deep learning; Job analysis; Three dimensional displays; 3d action recognition; Action recognition; Computational modelling; Efficient deep learning; Features extraction; Model compression; Point cloud compression; Point-clouds; Solid modelling; Task analysis; Three-dimensional display; Computational complexity","","","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018AAA0101900)","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Project of China under Grant 2018AAA0101900.

Methods: Oversized bars were printed with a glass-filled photoactive resin using a digital light processing technique. After sintering and post-processing, flexure and chevron notch fracture toughness bars were obtained in three principal orientations (0°, 45°, and 90°) with respect to the build direction. Mechanical properties were obtained according to the relevant ASTM standards. The hardness, indentation fracture resistance, and elastic modulus were measured for each orientation, and a Weibull analysis was conducted with the flexure responses. Fractography of the fracture surfaces was performed to identify the failure origins. Results: The 0° orientation exhibited characteristic strength, Weibull modulus, and elastic modulus of 313 MPa, 4.42, and 168 ± 3 GPa, respectively, which are comparable to lithium disilicate materials from traditional processes. However, build orientation contributed significantly to the flexure strength, elastic modulus, and Weibull modulus; the characteristic strengths for the 45° and 90° build orientations were 86 MPa and 177 MPa, respectively. The primary contribution to the orientation dependence was the number of residual build layer-related flaws from incomplete union between printed layers. Of note, hardness and the fracture toughness were not dependent on build orientation. Significance: AM of lithium disilicate materials can achieve the mechanical properties of materials produced by traditionally processing. Thus, while further process development is warranted, the outlook for dentistry is promising. © 2022 The Academy of Dental Materials","Additive manufacturing; Defect analysis; Digital light projection; Lithium disilicate glass ceramics","Dental Porcelain; Flexural Strength; Hardness; Polymerization; 3D printers; Additives; ASTM standards; Fracture mechanics; Fracture toughness; Glass ceramics; Hardness; Lithium compounds; Sintering; Weibull distribution; dental porcelain; lithia disilicate; Build orientation; Defect analysis; Digital light processing; Digital light projection; Glass-ceramics; Light projection; Lithium disilicate; Lithium disilicate glass; Lithium disilicate glass ceramic; Weibull modulus; hardness; polymerization; Elastic moduli","","Dental Porcelain, ; lithia disilicate, ","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (DGE-1762114); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIDCR, (R43DE025803)","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIDCR 1R43DE025803-01 J.

Grain rotation and grain boundary slip were the most important mechanisms that occurred before fracture. As the grain boundary slip increased, holes and micro-cracks nucleated in the grain boundary. These micro-cracks extend into the grain, causing inter-granular fracture. At strains above 9%, micro-cracks occurred in the TiC carbides scattered within the grains, resulting in a change in fracture direction from grain boundary to inter-granular. The accumulation of dislocations behind the γ′ phase and the grain boundaries provided the driving force needed to start and propagate the crack. © 2022, ASM International.","fracture; grain boundaries; GTD-111 superalloy; in situ tensile; laser processing","Cracks; Fracture; Fracture mechanics; Melting; Scanning electron microscopy; Superalloys; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Titanium carbide; Boundary slip; Fracture behavior; Fracture mechanisms; Grain rotation; Grain-boundaries; GTD-111 superalloy; In-situ tensile; Laser process; Micro cracks; Selective laser melting; Grain boundaries","","","","","","","Taheri M., Halvaee A., Kashani-Bozorg S.F., Effect of Pre- and Post-Weld Heat Treatment on Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of GTD-111 Superalloy Welds, Met.

Preliminary investigations were carried out to identify the influence of size using different geometrical shapes and observed that small sized features have higher dimensional deviation. Inorder to further proceed with the optimization study, artifact with small sized geometrical features was used. Optimization studies were performed using Grey Taguchi Analysis and Taguchi Methodology considering infill percentage, layer thickness, number of shells, and speed of printing as process parameters. This study reveals that the percentage of infill material and the number of shells have a significant impact on the dimensional deviation of 33.89% and 32.43%, respectively, on 3D printed ABS samples. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","3D printing;

Although the technology has developed rapidly in recent years, manufactured parts still lack consistent quality primarily owing to process-inherent variability, and the lack of effective sensing technologies enabling the ability to control the process during part production. Thus, there are high costs caused by rigorous post-process part inspection steps required to provide compliant part certificates. In contrast to typically deployed in-situ sensing technologies, eddy current testing (ECT) is a standardized nondestructive testing (NDT) technique able to provide compliant part certificates during post-process inspection according to existing standards. This study investigates the potential of ECT as an in-situ process monitoring technology for PBF-LB/M. Parts made from AlSi10Mg were manufactured on a PBF-LB/M machine using different process parameters yielding different relative densities ranging from 99%– 99.7%. During the build cycle, the parts were measured layer-by-layer with an ECT system mounted on the machine recoater. Signal analysis methods were developed which effectively separate and calibrate the electrical conductivity component (relative electrical conductivity) and the distance component (lift-off) of the ECT signals. The relative electrical conductivity was then compared to X-ray micro-computed tomography (μCT) measurement data demonstrating that layer-to-layer differences in relative density of about 0.1% can be successfully detected via ECT. In addition, the lift-off was used to monitor the thickness of the consolidated layers and the layer-to-layer part height. The results show that ECT is an effective technology for in-situ monitoring of the relative part density paving the way for deploying ECT for in-situ NDT of PBF-LB/M-manufactured parts. © 2022 The Author(s)","Eddy current testing (ECT); In-situ monitoring; Nondestructive testing (NDT); Powder bed fusion of metals (PBF-LB/M); Process monitoring","Computerized tomography; Eddy current testing; Electric conductivity; Metal testing; Metals; Powder metals; Process control; Eddy current testing; Eddy-current testing; In-situ monitoring; Nondestructive testing; Post process; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion of metal (PBF-LB/M); Relative density; Relative electrical conductivities; Sensing technology; Process monitoring","","","","","Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich, ETH; Innosuisse - Schweizerische Agentur für Innovationsförderung, Innosuisse, (33657.1)","Funding text 1: Open Access funding provided by ETH Zurich.

Although previous studies show recovery of high strength at room temperature, very few studies demonstrate successful properties at elevated temperatures required for industrial applications. The objectives of this study are to present a post-build heat treatment for high strength across a wide temperature range, determine the strength contribution of nanoscale precipitating phases to the overall mechanical properties of superalloy 718, and from these, provide a comprehensive microstructure-property relationship for wrought and AM 718 to guide efforts to simulate the properties of AM components. Laser powder bed fusion–produced superalloy 718 was characterized at multiple length scales using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy in the as-built condition and with multiple heat treatments designed to form combinations of γ′, γ″, and δ precipitates. Uniaxial tensile tests performed from room temperature to 600 °C on subsize specimens determined the yield strength, elastic modulus, ultimate tensile strength, fracture stress, and uniform elongation. Precipitates in this work proved to be weak barriers to dislocation motion through a dispersed barrier model, but they provided strength to the alloy through their consistent high density. The relative contribution to the yield strength from γ″ remained consistent between 48% and 57% of the total strength up to 600 °C, the primary influence on the high temperature strength of superalloy 718. The strength factors for γ″ and δ precipitates were found to trend inversely with tensile test temperature and may be attributable to the differences in precipitate coherency. A post-build heat treatment is recommended to maintain high strength at elevated temperatures. A quantitative microstructure-property relationship, dependent on precipitate size, density, and morphology, was derived and can estimate the yield strength across a wide temperature range applicable to the operational regimes for superalloy 718. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Alloy 718; Heat treatment; Laser powder bed fusion; Precipitation; Tensile properties","Additives; Heat treatment; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Microstructure; Morphology; Nickel alloys; Scanning electron microscopy; Strain hardening; Superalloys; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Yield stress; Alloy 718; Elevated temperature; High-strength; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Microstructure-property relationships; Post-processing; Powder bed; Property; Wide temperature ranges; Precipitation (chemical)","","","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-AC05-00OR22725); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Nuclear Energy, NE; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL, (2000R); Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL","Funding text 1: This research was sponsored in part by the Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, managed by UT-Battelle, LLC, for the US Department of Energy under contract number DE-AC05-00OR22725.

Thus, how the surface morphology affects bond strength has been studied using an adhesive epoxy. Samples include polished (P) surface, top/horizontal as-built (H) surface and side/vertical as-built surfaces which included nonmeshed (V), nonmeshed plus anodised (VA), and trabecular meshed (M) surfaces. Bond strength between epoxy and EBPBF Ti6Al4V increased in order: P, M, H, V, and then VA surfaces. Good strength in V samples was predominantly contributed by the mechanical effect through micro-interlocking in the partially melted powder. A further increase in bond strength has been obtained through anodising (VA samples), due to the adhesive having infused into the ultrafine and nano-pores. Finally, it has been found that a good interlocking effect but a strength reduction of porous Ti6Al4V have resulted in a strength level being relatively low in M samples. © 2022 The Author(s)","Adhesive and AM Ti6Al4V interlocking; Surface roughness; Surface treatment","","","","","","","","Liu S., Shin Y.C., Additive manufacturing of Ti6Al4V alloy: a review, Mater.

The columnar grains of the LPBF components grow along the build derection. Duo to the specific microstructures, the tensile and fatigue properties of LPBF components are anisotropic. So, the study on high temperature mechanical properties of LPBF Ti6Al4V need to be intestigated further. In this paper, high temperature tensile and fatigue samples were designed and manufactured by LPBF. Tensile tests were carried out at 350 °C, 450 °C and 550 °C. The effects of build direction and temperature on high temperature tensile properties were analyzed and compared. The fatigue tests were carried out at 450 °C, and the strain amplitude was in the range of ±1.5 %. The effects of build direction on the hysteresis loops and the fatigue fracture surfaces of fatigue samples were studied. The results showed that the build direction can affect the kinematic hardening significantly, but it has little effect on isotropic hardening. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Anisotropy; Fatigue property; High temperature; Laser powder bed fusion Ti6Al4V; Tensile property","Aluminum alloys; Anisotropy; Fatigue testing; Hardening; Tensile testing; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Anisotropic tensile property; Build direction; Fatigue properties; Fusion components; Highest temperature; Laser powder bed fusion ti6al4v; Laser powders; Powder bed; Tensile and fatigue properties; Vehicle structures; Ternary alloys","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12032018, 91860128)","This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No.91860128 and No.12032018.

In addition, the complex, unique microstructures imparted by the additive processes offer prospects of unprecedented advances to produce high-performance metal alloys for high-temperature and corrosive environments. Here, we present the first additive manufacturing of Inconel alloy 725, an advanced nickel-base superalloy that is the widely accepted gold standard material of choice for oil and gas, chemical, and marine applications. We explore the printability of Inconel alloy 725 and identify a wide processing space to build material with a crack- and near-pore-free microstructure. The conventionally heat-treated Inconel alloy 725 has an equiaxed, near-fully recrystallised microstructure containing copious twin boundaries and nano-precipitates. It also displays promising tensile properties and corrosion resistance compared to its wrought counterpart. Our work opens the door toward additive manufacturing of Inconel alloy 725 components with optimised microstructure and topology geometry for applications in harsh environments. © 2022 The Authors","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Corrosion properties; Inconel 725; Microstructure; Powder bed fusion; Superalloy; Tensile properties","3D printers; Additives; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant alloys; Corrosive effects; High strength alloys; High temperature corrosion; Marine applications; Nickel alloys; Product design; Textures; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Corrosion property; High-strength; Inconel; Inconel 725; Inconel alloys; Laser powders; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion; Superalloys","","","","","Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE, (MOE2017-T2-2-119); Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE; Nanyang Technological University, NTU","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the Ministry of Education of Singapore , Official Number: MOE2017-T2-2-119 .

To economically and efficiently manufacture these large titanium alloy components, Wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is suitable for such applications. However, the mechanical properties of additive manufacturing titanium alloy hinder its further development. In this paper, Wire and arc additive manufacturing TC4 titanium alloy was selected to carry out experiments, and the mechanical properties of additive manufacturing titanium alloy were obtained. The finite element predicted model of fatigue crack initiation life was established and the feasibility of this model in predicting fatigue crack initiation life of TC4 titanium alloy was verified by comparing it with the experimental results. The test results show that the elastic modulus, tensile strength, Poisson's ratio of additive manufacturing TC4 titanium alloy are similar to those of TC4 titanium alloy forgings, but the fatigue performance is far from that of traditional TC4 forgings, and that the error between the results of the fatigue crack initiation life prediction model established in this paper and the test results is less than 40%, which has a certain referential significance. © 2022, Editorial Board of Journal of Ship Mechanics.

Even though single-aspect biomaterials have been used for establishing a biomaterial ink, however, they often fail to meet all properties needed to be used as a biomaterial ink. Carrying this point in view, we have formulated hydrogels using Diethylaminoethyl Cellulose (DEAE-Cellulose), Alginate (ALG), and Gelatin (GEL) as biomaterial inks. Initially, six different hydrogel formulations (F1-F6) were prepared with varying concentrations of DEAE- Cellulose (0.45%−2%), alginate (1%−2%), and keeping gelatine concentration constant at 3.33%. These formulations were then assayed by swelling and degradation tests. Out of six, three hydrogels (F3, F4, and F5) were eliminated after initial studies due to the rapid degradation rate. The other three hydrogels ( F1, F2, and F6) were further thoroughly analyzed by the rheological study, mechanical study, printability assay, morphological analysis, and biocompatibility assays. Here, We have demonstrated the successful formulation of three biomaterial inks utilizing three different biopolymers for the field of tissue engineering with adequate swelling, degradation, rheological and printability properties. It was observed that the incorporation of DEAE-Cellulose significantly improved the shear thinning and viscosity recovery of hydrogels. Also, it improves mechanical integrity and printing accuracy. Moreover, all three hydrogels have shown excellent hemocompatibility and cytocompatibility.

The influence of the LPBF parameters and building orientation was investigated for density, roughness, hardness, and wearing properties, as weight loss, wear volume, and friction coefficient. The tribological characterization was carried out by means of Ball on Plate Tests, using both 100Cr6 steel and alumina balls as counterpart. Then, the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) allowed to verify the significance of process parameters, counterpart material and test area. The experimental results highlight the anisotropic effect of the process parameters on the performance of the manufactured samples for all the response variables. Tribological tests performed with steel ball showed an adhesive wear phenomenon, while the alumina ball an adhesive one.

Due to the specific combination of properties, tungsten heavy alloys are used for special applications such as X-ray and γ-radiation shielding, balancing weights, collimators and molds. For optimum performance, complex geometries can be required in those applications. L-PBF of tungsten heavy alloys such as W-Ni-Fe is challenging due to the high thermal conductivity, high viscosity of the liquid phase, the high melting point and sensitivity to thermal cracking. The effect of L-PBF processing parameters on the material microstructure is therefore studied for different W-Ni-Fe powders, applying substrate preheating temperatures up to 800 °C. Furthermore, the impact of thermal post-treatment is investigated, leading to a microstructure close to conventionally sintered material. Crack-free samples can be generated from all powders, but residual and heterogeneously distributed pores are still detected. It is shown that evaporation of Ni[sbnd]Fe binder matrix during L-PBF is significantly lower for pre-alloyed powders than for mixed powders. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Heavy alloy; Laser based powder bed fusion; PBF-LB; Tungsten; W-Ni-Fe","Gamma rays; Iron alloys; Microstructure; Powders; Radiation shielding; Ternary alloys; Thermal conductivity; Tungsten alloys; Complex parts; Heavy alloy; Laser based powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Laser-based; Part geometry; PBF-LB; Powder bed; Tungsten heavy alloys; W-Ni-Fe; 3D printers","","","","","","","Zhu Y.B., Wang Y., Zhang X.Y., Qin G.W., W/NiFe phase interfacial characteristics of liquid-phase sintered W–Ni–Fe alloy, Int.

To address this problem, a warm isostatic press (WIP) process was adopted to control the temperature and isostatic pressure in the chamber. When only the temperature was applied (annealing), the tensile strength increased, but the elongation at break decreased in specimens fabricated with powders of polyamide 12 (PA12) because of the increase in crystallinity without a decrease in porosities. However, when temperature and pressure were simultaneously applied, the tensile strength increased compared with tensile strengths of specimens treated with and without post-processing. The elongation at break compensates for the reduced value obtained by annealing. To identify the effect of the WIP process on the specimens fabricated by the PBF process, mechanical properties were quantitatively investigated. Additionally, tightness and injection moulding tests were performed to qualitatively estimate the effect. These tests verified the effectiveness of the WIP process in the PBF process. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing (AM); Injection moulding; Polymer-based powder bed fusion (PBF); Tightness; Warm isostatic press (WIP)","3D printers; Crystallinity; Fabrication; Injection molding; Porosity; Presses (machine tools); Additive manufacturing; Elongation-at-break; Fusion process; Isostatic Press; Polymer based; Polymer-based powder bed fusion; Powder bed; Press process; Tightness; Warm isostatic press; Tensile strength","","","","","Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE, (20021996); Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE; Korea Institute of Industrial Technology, KITECH, (EH220013); Korea Institute of Industrial Technology, KITECH","We thank Seo Hee Kim, the president of Gun Il precision, for technical issues about the experiments of injection moulding.

However, conventional high-strength wrought Al alloys that are processed using L-PBF have limited application owing to their poor cracking resistance. To investigate the cracking mechanism, L-PBF was used to fabricate a 2024Al alloy. The resultant microstructure exhibited severe hot cracking, which occurred at grain boundaries with a high angle in both solidification and liquation cracks. Increasing the scanning speed increased the susceptibility to cracking. The effect of scanning speed on the eutectics content of Al2Cu and Al2CuMg and the residual stress in as-fabricated samples are discussed. Crack elimination at a low scanning speed could be ascribed to the lower thermal stresses and adequate liquid feeding during the late stage of solidification. In addition, based on the RDG (Rappaz-Drezet-Gremaud) model, a cracking susceptibility map was produced, in which the cracking susceptibility was determined to increase with an increase in the solidification rate, in agreement with experimental observation. © 2022","Al-cu-mg alloy; Cracking susceptibility; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser scanning speed; Residual stress","Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Copper alloys; Grain boundaries; High strength alloys; Magnesium alloys; Scanning; Solidification; Speed; Ternary alloys; Aluminum-cu-mg alloy; Cracking mechanisms; Cracking susceptibility; High-strength; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Laser scanning speed; Mg alloy; Powder bed; Scanning speed; Residual stresses","","","","","Northwestern Polytechnical University, NPU, (040302, 2020-TZ-02); Northwestern Polytechnical University, NPU; State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing, SKLSP; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFB1100100); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (G2021KY05104); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi Province, (2022JQ-479); Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi Province; Shanghai Aerospace Science and Technology Innovation Foundation, (SAST2018-066); Shanghai Aerospace Science and Technology Innovation Foundation","The work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFB1100100 ), the Research Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing (NPU) , China (Grant No. 2020-TZ-02 ), Advance Research Projects in the Field of Manned Spaceflight (Project No. 040302 ) and Shanghai Aerospace Science and Technology Innovation Fund Project (Project No. SAST2018-066 ).

Polymeric piezoelectric materials have attracted interest for actuation, sensing, energy harvesting, and storage applications due to their capability to sustain larger strains than ceramic piezoelectric materials. In this work, a novel electric poling-assisted additive manufacturing (EPAM) technology that integrates a fused deposition modeling (FDM) three-dimensional (3D) printer with a corona electric poling setup is demonstrated to directly print piezoelectric active materials with improved piezoelectric characteristics. The developed EPAM technology overcomes two main shortcomings of the conventional manufacturing methods for poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVdF) materials: (1) their shapes are constrained to planar or fiber-like geometries, and (2) the need for additional electric poling as a post-processing treatment. Compared with the contact poling method, the EPAM method eliminates the need to apply electrodes for poling. The EPAM process can accomplish stretching and poling simultaneously which are necessary conditions for the polarization. During the EPAM process, stretching the molten PVdF rod rearranges the amorphous strands in the film plane, and the applied electric field aligns dipoles towards the same direction. The EPAM process can print free-form PVdF structures and induce the formation of β-phase, which is primarily responsible for the piezoelectric response. The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results indicate the β-phase content increased from 15.38% to 17.14% corresponding to unpoled printed and EPAM printed samples, respectively. PVdF force sensors were successfully printed, and the piezoelectric activity (pC/N) was calculated based on the piezoelectric output voltage. The piezoelectric activity has a positive correlation with the piezoelectric coefficient that is explained in detail in section 3.2. The results demonstrate that the average piezoelectric activity of EPAM printed PVdF films was 47.76 pC/N, or about five times higher than unpoled 3D printed films, at 9.0 pC/N. The piezoelectric activity of unpoled 3D printed PVdF films indicates that 3D printing in the absence of an electric field does not result in dipole alignment. The 3D printed samples show an anisotropic mechanical behavior, and the bonding surface strength is sensitive to the printing speed. The maximum Young's modulus (534.63 MPa) occurred at 3 mm/s and 0° infill, and the highest ultimate tensile strength (UTS) (25.35 MPa) was achieved at 20 mm/s, and 90° infill. Both the Young's modulus and UTS from the EPAM printed samples are lower than unpoled samples. A fully 3D printed device was demonstrated to identify the position and magnitude of forces and results were visualized via structure-embedded integrated Light emitting diodes (LEDs). Overall, with the advantage of mechanical structural design flexibility and ease of printing of piezoelectric materials, the developed EPAM technology opens a new avenue to simplify device design and fabrication methodologies along with low-cost implementations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","2000 MSC; Direct ink writing; Electric poling-assisted additive manufacturing; Fused deposition modeling; Poly(vinylidene fluoride)","Deposition; Electric corona; Energy harvesting; Films; Fluorine compounds; Functional materials; Fused Deposition Modeling; Piezoelectric materials; Piezoelectricity; 2000 MSC; Additive manufacturing process; Additive manufacturing technology; Direct ink writing; Electric poling; Electric poling-assisted additive manufacturing; Piezoelectric; Piezoelectric activity; Poly(vinylidene fluoride); Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy","","","","","NSF Center for Robots and Sensors for the Human Well-Being, (CNS-1439717); Purdue Polytechnic Institute's Realizing the Digital Enterprise; Purdue Polytechnic Institute’s Realizing the Digital Enterprise; National Science Foundation, NSF, (CNS-1726865); National Science Foundation, NSF; Purdue University, PU","Funding text 1: This work was financially supported, in part, by the NSF through grant CNS-1726865 and by the NSF Center for Robots and Sensors for the Human Well-Being (RoSe-HUB) under grant CNS-1439717, the NSF Center for Robots and Sensors for the Human Well-Being (RoSe-HUB), and the 2020 SEED Grant from Purdue Polytechnic Institute's Realizing the Digital Enterprise.

Tensile and CTE samples printed in the x, y, and z orientations were annealed, hot isostatic pressing (HIP)-treated, and subsequently characterized for porosity, thermal expansion, and tensile behavior. Porosity was determined through computed tomography and showed that HIP closed most of the pores. Some anisotropy in tensile strength was statistically identified both before and after HIP and was not found to completely depend on porosity. The CTE was found to depend on build orientation and porosity; the CTE values determined (average 1.47 ± 0.06 µm/m °C for 30-100 °C) were lower than typical for conventionally manufactured Invar36. Most importantly, HIP after annealing was found to reduce the porosity levels and affect neither the tensile properties nor the CTE values.

Increasingly strict legislation regarding pollutant emissions and the protection of the environment are more important than ever. The change to electric mobility is also presenting the mobile world with new challenges and opportunities. Vehicles are becoming more and more efficient with higher power densities and better performance. Application-adapted components are being developed and used as a matter of preference. New production technologies can help to realise the change in mobility reliably. Additive manufacturing is one way of producing functionally integrated and performance-optimised components. AM offers the possibility to produce application-specific performance parts. Electric vehicles often have a problem with the thermal load of the components during power output and charging. Additively manufactured components with optimised topology and integrated cooling strive to achieve higher power density, enhanced cooling performance, and improved mechanical properties. AM not only makes it possible to produce functionally integrated and application-adapted components but also to reduce CO2 emissions and conserve resources. The potential of additive manufacturing for mobility is particularly interesting for the spare and performance parts sector. Components can be improved in performance and manufactured directly on-site. The higher power density and the elimination of transport routes can make an additional significant contribution to environmental protection. This paper presents an overview of the current state of additive manufacturing in the field of electromobility with regard to replacement and performance parts using 3D metal printing. Based on an extensive literature research, a market overview is given. This serves as the basis for the further procedure and, building on this, the advantages of additive manufacturing are demonstrated using the example of an electric motor. The selected electric motor is an example of a defective component in a vehicle that needs to be replaced and whose performance can be improved by additive manufacturing and which can be produced on-site in a quantity of one. The motor is verified by means of a FEM simulation in order to determine the selection of an optimal water jacket topology and to demonstrate further potential for the future. © 2022 by the authors.","3D metal printing; after-sales; CO<sub>2</sub> reduction; higher power density; performance parts; resources efficient; spare parts; topology optimised","","","","","","Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts of the State Baden-Wuerttemberg; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (13FH4I06IA)","This research was funded by Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts of the State Baden-Wuerttemberg (Germany), by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the program “FH-Impuls” (Project SmartPro, Subproject Smart-ADD, Grant no. 13FH4I06IA).","Manuel R., Germany Automotive Aftermarket Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report by Replacement Part; Schuhmann D., Rockinger C., Merkel M., Harrison D.K., A Study on Additive Manufacturing for Electromobility, WEVJ, 13, (2022); Support Studies for the Evaluation of the VBER: Support Study and Study on Consumer Purchasing Behaviour in Europe: Final Report, (2020); Blennow A., Frick P., Gardfjell M., Application of Additive Manufacturing for Spare Parts in the Automotive Industry, Bachelor’s Thesis, (2018); Lewicki W., The Economic Dimension of the Outsourcing Application in the Field of Selected Logistics Services Based on the Example of the European Automotive Industry, Proceedings of the 19th International Scientific Conference Business Logistics in Modern Management; Lewicki W., Maintaining union regulations in the form of sector exclusions with the determinant of the development of competitiveness of the european and europe automotive market, Proceedings of the 36th International Scientific Conference on Economic and Social Development—""Building Resilient Society""; Barbosa W.S., Wanderley R.F.F., Gioia M.M., Gouvea F.C., Goncalves F.M., Additive or subtractive manufacturing: Analysis and comparison of automotive spare-parts, J.

Despite the incontrovertible advantages offered by this manufacturing technique, the material produced is usually affected by the presence of internal defects, a poor surface quality, and process-induced residual stresses. These features strongly affect the fatigue performance and reproducibility of AMed parts, limiting the adoption of deterministic criteria for fatigue assessment. A probabilistic approach is therefore needed for the analysis of critical and structural components. To this aim, a fully probabilistic finite element (FE) post-processor, ProFACE, was developed by part of the authors to assess the fatigue strength and critical locations of complex components in the presence of process-induced defects. A wide benchmark activity was supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) to test the software capabilities for the life prediction of components manufactured in AlSi10Mg by L-PBF. After tuning ProFACE parameters based on the results obtained on standard fatigue specimens, the software was used to estimate the fatigue life of the components obtaining a good description of the experimental dataset for both volumetric and surface defects. The software was then used to explore the effect of the variability of the most significant parameters affecting fatigue strength of AlSi10Mg AMed components. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; As-built surface; Defects; Failure probability; Fatigue; Residual stresses","3D printers; Additives; Failure (mechanical); Residual stresses; Software testing; Surface defects; Additive manufacturing technology; Aeronautics industry; As-build surface; Failure Probability; Fatigue strength; Internal defects; Manufacturing techniques; Metal additives; Probabilistic fatigue; Space industry; Fatigue of materials","","","","","Estech; European Space Agency, ESA, (4000120221-17-NL-LvH); European Space Agency, ESA; Politecnico di Milano, (4000133245/20/NL/AR/idb, ESA-TRP-TECMSP-SOW-009494); Politecnico di Milano","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the support of the European Space Agency trough contract n. 4000120221-17-NL-LvH, in which MTC contracted Politecnico di Milano for “ProFACE Benchmark” according to ESA-TRP-TECMSP-SOW-009494, and contract n. 4000133245/20/NL/AR/idb, in which MTC contracted Politecnico di Milano for “ProFACE surface features extension” according to ESA-TRP-TECMSP-SOW-009494.

Modelled metamaterial are fabricated using selective laser melting (SLM) process with Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The fabricated metamaterials are mechanically tested under quasi-static compressive loading condition. The heat treatment effect on compressive behavior and microstructure is also observed. The as-printed metamaterial has strength (173.36 MPa) and fracture strain (2.96%), whereas heat-treatment decreases the strength to (146.08 MPa) and increases the fracture strain to (12.60%). The increase in ductility after heat treatment is due to the formation of β-Ti and decrease in residual stresses. The presence of β-Ti phase is confirmed using microstructural and X-ray diffraction method. X-ray diffraction also confirms the decrease in tensile residual stress value from (179.5 ± 4.5 MPa) for as-printed to (96.5 ± 2.4 MPa) after heat-treatment process. Normal residual stress value is also dependent on the location of measurement on the metamaterial. However, heat treatment and location of measurement have no effect on shear residual stress. In the last, finite element simulation has been carried out to visualize the effect of diagonal struts on the deformation behavior. The result shows diagonal struts in the E. aspergillum based metamaterial helps to prevent global buckling and uniformly distribute the load, hence improves the strength of the metamaterial. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Heat treatment; Metamaterial; Residual stress; Selective laser melting; Ti-6Al-4V","Fabrication; Heat treatment; Melting; Residual stresses; Selective laser melting; Shear flow; Struts; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; X ray diffraction; 'current; After-heat treatment; Euplectella aspergillum; Fracture strain; Laser melting process; Mechanical; Porous architectures; Selective laser melting; Stress values; Ti-6al-4v; Aluminum alloys","","","","","","","Benedyk J.C., Aluminum alloys for lightweight automotive structures, In Materials, design and manufacturing for lightweight vehicles, (2017); Uhlmann E., Kersting R., Klein T.B., Cruz M.F., Borille A.V., Additive manufacturing of titanium alloy for aircraft components, Procedia Cirp, 35, pp. 55-60, (2015); Luo A.A., Magnesium development as a lightweight material—in competition with other structural materials.

Specimens along horizontal (HOR) and vertical (VER) directions with respect to the build platform were built. Rotation of elongated grains was evidenced by the movement of its low angle rotation axes from <001> towards <112> along <001> ∼ <111> line during deformation. Consequently, geometric hardening and softening accompanied with grain rotation was responsible for the dynamic recrystallization-like flow stress fluctuation during deformation. Moreover, variation of the rotation axes between grains is observed in the HOR specimen, suggesting that the occurrence of compatible deformation between grains is needed. However, intergranular cracks were observed in the HOR specimen, demonstrating grain boundaries embrittlement. Hence, the decrease of ductility of the HOR specimen is originated from incompatible grain deformation when deformation was perpendicular to grain boundaries. © 2022","Grain boundary embrittlement; High-temperature deformation; Laser powder bed fusion; Misorientation; Nickel alloys","Anisotropy; Deformation; Ductility; Dynamic recrystallization; Grain boundaries; Rotation; Textures; Deformation behavior; Dynamic recrystallisation; Elevated temperature; Grain boundary embrittlement; High temperature deformation; Inconel 625; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Misorientations; Powder bed; Nickel alloys","","","","","School of Materials Science and Engineering; Shanghai Sailing Program, (17YF1408700); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai, (19ZR1425200); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51971144); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFB0407300)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2018YFB0407300), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51971144), Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai (Grant No.19ZR1425200), and Shanghai Sailing Program (No. 17YF1408700).

In this paper, inspired by the hierarchical structure of biological materials, a novel hierarchical circular-cell configuration of a lattice structure was proposed. The advantage of the new lattice configuration is that the use of a smooth circular cell is able to alleviate the stress concentration induced by the intersection of straight struts. Additionally, the consideration of structural hierarchy can bring improved mechanical properties of lattice structures. The hierarchical circular lattice structures with 5 × 5 × 5 unit cells were fabricated through a digital light processing (DLP) 3D printer, using the hard-tough resin. The mechanical properties of the lattice structures were investigated by a compression experiment and a numerical simulation. Results show that the interaction effect of structural hierarchy was the potential mechanism for the enhancement of mechanical properties. The designed hierarchical circular-cell lattice structure exhibits improved stress distribution uniformity, enhanced mechanical performance, and energy absorption capacity. The maximum improvement values are ~342.4% for specific stiffness, ~13% for specific strength, ~126.6% for specific energy absorption (SEA), and ~18% for crash load efficiency (CLE). The developed hierarchical circular-cell lattice configuration will enrich the present lattice systems and be useful for future multifunctional applications. © 2022 by the authors.","configuration design; energy absorption capacity; lattice structures; mechanical properties; structural hierarchy","","","","","","Key Research and Development Projects of Shaanxi Province, (2020GY-252, 2022NY-211, 2021GY-277); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (XJS210401); Youth Innovation Team of Shaanxi Universities, (2022-63); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52005378); UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (104518); Materials Service Safety Assessment Facilities, (MSAF-2021-107)","This project is supported by the Opening project fund of Materials Service Safety Assessment Facilities (No. MSAF-2021-107).

Bioink is the necessary component to incorporate the cells that will be printed by extrusion bioprinting. However, bioinks and extrusion printing can generate shear stresses mechanically unfavorable for cell survival. We thus developed a bioink, based on methacrylated collagen and hyaluronic acid, in combination with porous poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) solid microscaffolds to protect cells against mechanical stress during extrusion printing. We found that porosities of the microscaffolds allowed human chondosarcoma cells to colonize the structure. Moreover, metabolic activity of these chondrosarcoma cells, fibroblast cells, and dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) incorporated within bioink (before printing) increased 4-fold in presence of a polylysine- or collagen-coated microscaffolds compared with those cultured without microscaffolds. Their survival increased by 10% either by hand deposition or by bioprinting extrusion (bioprinter BioBot®Basic) compared to cells in bioink without microscaffolds. In addition to the mechanoshield properties provided by microscaffolds, they allow the migration of DPSCs stem cells towards HCS-2/8 cancer cells after 7 days of co-culture in an organoid created by bioprinting extrusion while without microscaffolds the cells aggregated and remained static. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Bioink; Bioprinting; DPSCs; HCS-2/8; Microscaffolds; Organoids","biomaterial; collagen; collagen type 1; gelatin; hyaluronic acid; hydrogel; molecular scaffold; adipose derived stem cell; Article; biomechanics; bioprinting; bone mineralization; cancer cell; cancer survival; cell migration; cell survival; cell viability; chondrosarcoma cell line; confocal laser scanning microscopy; confocal microscopy; controlled study; dental pulp stem cell; HCS 2,8 cell line; human; human cell; MTT assay; NIH 3T3 cell line; odontoblast; organoid; scanning electron microscopy; shear stress; tensile strength; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; tissue regeneration; tooth pulp; tumor microenvironment; wettability","","collagen, 9007-34-5; gelatin, 9000-70-8; hyaluronic acid, 31799-91-4, 9004-61-9, 9067-32-7","","","","","Moghaddam A.S., Khonakdar H.A., Arjmand M., Jafari S.H., Bagher Z., Moghaddam Z.S., Chimerad M., Sisakht M.M., Shojaei S., Review of bioprinting in regenerative medicine: naturally derived bioinks and stem cells, ACS Appl.

Achieving the desired thin powder layers that are both sufficiently dense and uniform is essential for maintaining the requisite geometric tolerances and final part quality. In this study, we focus on the influence of the substrate surface topography by comparing spreading performance over a set of realistic surfaces. We simulate powder spreading over these surfaces using a calibrated non-spherical particle Discrete Element Model for Ti-6Al-4V that incorporates cohesion and Coulomb friction interactions between particles and surfaces. We identify the four key length scales of the recoating process determined by frictional contacts, powder size distribution, the layer thickness and the melted surface topography. We find that realistic AM surfaces show markedly different powder coverage compared to an idealised flat-plane. Rougher surfaces are found to be recoated with larger amounts of powder than smoother surfaces, as smaller particles get trapped by the grooves and valleys across the surface. Counterintuitively, we find that a finer more cohesive powder can achieve the best layer coverage over realistic surfaces - indicating that powder flowability is an incomplete measure of powder spreading performance on realistic AM surfaces. We also demonstrate how the recoating process can significantly size segregate the feedstock powder, favouring deposition of smaller sized particles on the melted surfaces. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Discrete element method; Length scales; Melted surfaces; Metal powder; Powder coverage; Powder recoating; Powder spreading; Realistic surfaces; Size segregation","","","","","","","","Nguyen Q.B., Luu D.N., Nai S.M.L., Zhu Z., Chen Z., Wei J., The role of powder layer thickness on the quality of SLM printed parts, Archives of Civil and Mechanical Engineering, 18, 3, pp. 948-955, (2018); Nath S.D., Gupta G., Kearns M., Gulsoy O., Atre S.V., Et al., Effects of layer thickness in laser-powder bed fusion of 420 stainless steel, Rapid Prototyp J, 26, 7, pp. 1197-1208, (2020); Boley C.D., Khairallah S.A., Rubenchik A.M., Et al., Calculation of laser absorption by metal powders in additive manufacturing, Appl Opt, 54, 9, (2015); Cummins S., Cleary P.W., Delaney G., Phua A., Sinnott M., Gunasegaram D., Davies C., Et al., A coupled DEM/SPH computational model to simulate microstructure evolution in ti-6Al-4V laser powder bed fusion processes, Metals (Basel), 11, 6, (2021); Meier C., Weissbach R., Weinberg J., Wall W.A., John Hart A., Et al., Modeling and characterization of cohesion in fine metal powders with a focus on additive manufacturing process simulations, Powder Technol, 343, pp. 855-866, (2019); Phua A., Doblin C., Owen P., Davies C.H.J., Delaney G.W., Et al., The effect of recoater geometry and speed on granular convection and size segregation in powder bed fusion, Powder Technol, (2021); Wang L., Zhou Z., Li E., Shen H., Yu A., Powder deposition mechanism during powder spreading with different spreader geometries in powder bed fusion additive manufacturing, Powder Technol, 395, pp. 802-810, (2022); Haeri S., Et al., Optimisation of blade type spreaders for powder bed preparation in additive manufacturing using DEM simulations, Powder Technol, 321, pp. 94-104, (2017); Sun Y.Y., Gulizia S., Oh C.H., Doblin C., Yang Y.F., Qian M., Et al., Manipulation and characterization of a novel titanium powder precursor for additive manufacturing applications, JOM, 67, 3, pp. 564-572, (2015); James W.B., ASTM comitte B09 worshop on powder characterization, Int.

Microstructure evolution was analysed by means of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Different substrate plate temperatures lead to differences in microstructure evolution due to the prevailing cooling conditions and overall thermal history, eventually resulting in different hardening behavior under quasi-static tensile loading even if the general mechanical performance of the different conditions is very similar. From the results shown, it is deduced that the prevailing microstructures are a result of different internal stress states evolved during solidification, cooling and intrinsic heat treatment, respectively. The different internal stress states promote increased local orientation deviations within the grains, which can be rationalized by different dislocation densities. The monotonic strength of the steel in focus is outstanding compared with cold-rolled counterparts and data available in literature. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Austenitic steels; Build temperature; Mechanical properties, Twinning; Microstructure","","","","","","","","Pauzon C., Foret P., Hryha E., Arunprasad T., Nyborg L., Argon-helium mixtures as laser-powder bed fusion atmospheres: towards increased build rate of Ti-6Al-4V, J.

However, the effect of printing speed and part aspect ratio on the self-deformation behaviors of parts have not been well studied. In this work, the effect of printing speed and part geometry on the shape recovery behavior was studied. The thermal history was obtained by implementing finite element analysis (FEA) models using different printing speeds. The corresponding residual stress gradient between top layers and bottom layers were analyzed and found critical to the heating-bending behavior. Self-deformation occurs when re-heating the parts, showing interesting shape memory effect that can be tuned using different printing speeds and part aspect ratio. With a smaller part thickness or a higher printing speed, more obvious self-deformation/bending behavior can be observed. Stress gradient Δσy and temperature distribution obtained from simulation suggest a strong correlation between Δσy and bending angle β, validating the experimental observations. Up to 50 cycles of heating/bending- cooling- reheating cyclic tests were performed to study the repeatability and reversibility of the part self-deformation behavior. Digital image correlation analysis was used to analyze the self-deformation behavior during the first heating cycle. Based on the analysis of the printing speed on the self-deformation behavior, a bio-inspired stem tendril-like gripper was fabricated using a printing speed of 90 mm/s that presents the largest deformation. The bionic gripper possesses a fast response which is <2.5 s to grab pine needles with a diameter of ~0.5 mm, showing good potentials used as actuators/sensors. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","4D printing;

Defects of six series of samples manufactured by different parameters is dominated by pores, micro-cracks, and lack of fusion, respectively. The superalloy is isothermally oxidised in 950 °C dry air for 500 h. The oxidation resistance of LPBF GH3536 depends on the types and quantity of processing defects, wherein the sample with micro-cracks as the main defect exhibit the worst oxidation resistance. Electron probe microanalysis of the superalloy revealed the impact of micro-cracks on diffusion process. Defects seriously deteriorate the oxidation resistance, especially micro-crack defects. Reducing manufacturing defects in the samples can improve the corrosion resistance. © 2022 The Author(s)","Defects; Electron probe microanalysis; High-temperature oxidation; Laser powder bed fusion; Microstructure; Superalloy","","","","","","","","(1975); Nakanishi T., Kawakami H., Creep properties of Hastelloy-X in impure helium environments, Nucl.

There is currently, however, a lack of fundamental test data on the structural performance of WAAM elements. To address this, an experimental study into the cross-sectional behaviour of WAAM tubular beams has been conducted and is presented herein. A total of 14 stainless steel square, rectangular and irregular hollow sections, spanning over all cross-section classes of EN 1993-1-4 and AISC 370, were tested in four-point bending. 3D laser scanning, silicone casting and Archimedes’ measurements were employed to collectively determine the as-built geometry and local geometric imperfections of the test specimens, while digital image correlation (DIC) was used to monitor the deformation responses of the specimens during testing. The full moment–curvature histories and key experimental results are presented and discussed. Similar cross-sectional behaviour to that of equivalent, conventionally manufactured sections was observed, with the more slender cross-sections showing increased susceptibility to local buckling. However, owing to the inherent geometric variability of WAAM, the tested 3D printed beams exhibited more variable flexural capacities between the repeat specimens than is generally displayed by conventionally produced stainless steel sections. Finally, the test results were used to assess the applicability of current cross-section design provisions in the European (EN 1993-1-4) and American (AISC 370) structural design specifications, as well as the continuous strength method (CSM), to WAAM stainless steel tubular beams. © 2022 The Authors","Digital image correlation (DIC); Irregular hollow section; Metal 3D printing; Rectangular hollow section (RHS); Square hollow section (SHS); Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM)","Additives; Construction industry; Geometry; Image correlation; Metals; Silicones; Stainless steel; Strain measurement; Structural design; Wire; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Digital image correlation; Digital image correlations; Hollow section; Irregular hollow section; Metal 3d printing; Rectangular hollow section; Rectangular hollow sections; Square hollow section; Square hollow sections; Wire arc; Wire arc additive manufacturing; buckling; deformation; digital image; manufacturing; steel; strength; structural component; 3D printers","","","","","Collaboratorium for Research on Infrastructure and Cities; Data Centric Engineering programme; UKCRIC, (EP/R017727/1); Alan Turing Institute, ATI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/R010161/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; China Scholarship Council, CSC","This experimental programme was possible thanks to the funding and support from the Data Centric Engineering programme at the Alan Turing Institute (ATI) and the China Scholarship Council (CSC).

As shown in previous experimental studies, the crack leading up to failure systematically initiated on a single surface defect. The nature and morphology of the critical defect did not show any influence on the fatigue strength, and only its size seemed to matter. To take into account the critical defect size, models based on linear elastic fracture mechanics were implemented and identified. A modified Paris propagation law was used to model the short crack regime. This approach was used to predict S–N curve domains based on critical defects size range. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","316L Stainless steel; High Cycle Fatigue (HCF); Laser Powder Ded Fusion (L-PBF); Modelization; Short crack propagation","Cracks; Electric discharges; Fracture mechanics; High-cycle fatigue; Morphology; Steel corrosion; Surface defects; 316 L stainless steel; Critical defects; Defect size; Fatigue life assessment; High cycle fatigue; Laser powder ded fusion (L-PBF); Laser powders; Modelization; Short crack propagation; Austenitic stainless steel","","","","","Arts & Métiers institute of technology; French region Pays de la Loire","Funding text 1: This research was funded by a PhD grant from the French region Pays de la Loire.

However, there is still a paucity of research on the mechanical performance of the material produced with a variety of ME manufacturing parameters. This paper presents an experimental study on the tensile performance and plastic anisotropy of ME Ultrafuse Steel 316 L. Mechanical testing under quasi-static tensile loading conditions has been conducted on specimens produced with a variety of ME manufacturing parameters. The effect of primary manufacturing parameters, namely layer height, print speed, and raster angle, on the elastoplastic behaviour of this material has been examined. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the mechanical testing results has been used to investigate the relationship between these manufacturing parameters and the resulting mechanical properties. The failure mechanisms of the specimens were examined, with digital image correlation (DIC) employed to map local strain fields during plastic deformation. The experimental results confirm the existence of non-uniform transverse straining and the variation of plastic anisotropy between two raster angles ( ± 45° and 0°/90°). The ± 45° raster angle specimens outperformed their 0°/90° counterparts, while the former have also exhibited a more ductile behaviour when compared to the latter. The visual representations of the strain evolution in the specimens during deformation confirmed the existence of a non-uniform deformation, even at low tensile strain, owing to the different ME manufacturing parameters. Overall, it has been found in this study that the print speed does not have substantial influence on the tensile performance of the material, while, on the other hand, the raster angle and the layer height appear to have a significant influence. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing parameters; Elastoplastic; Fused deposition modelling; Fused filament fabrication; Material extrusion; Plastic anisotropy; Steel 316L; Ultrafuse 316L","ABAQUS; Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Anisotropy; Austenitic stainless steel; Elastoplasticity; Extrusion; Failure (mechanical); Fused Deposition Modeling; Image correlation; Industrial research; Tensile strain; Tensile strength; 3-D printing; 316L; 3d printing parameter; 3D-printing; Elastoplastics; Fused filament fabrication; Material extrusion; Plastic anisotropy; Steel 316l; Ultrafuse 316l; Tensile testing","","","","","School of Engineering of the University of Limerick; Science and Engineering Faculty, Queensland University of Technology","This work has been supported by the Faculty of Science and Engineering and the School of Engineering of the University of Limerick.

Prostheses manufacturing requires patients’ computed tomography (CT) images. Poor quality images result in incorrectly sized prostheses, necessitating repeat imaging and refitting. The Centre for Rapid Prototyping and Manufacturing (CRPM) produces most facial prostheses in South Africa but does not have a prescribed optimised CT protocol. Therefore, this study was undertaken. Methods: A collection of CRPM STLs used in the design and manufacturing of craniomaxillofacial prostheses is available. The image quality of stereolithography (STL) files of CRPM CT scans was evaluated to determine what constitutes good image quality. This collection was scrutinised for inclusion in the image quality evaluation. After scrutiny, 35 STLs of individuals ≥15 years of age were selected and included metadata attached to the DICOM file. Furthermore, only STLs created without manipulation by the same designer were included in the collection. Before the qualitative evaluation of the STLs, eight different critical anatomical reference points (CARPs) were identified with the assistance of an expert team. A visual acuity rating scale of three categories was devised for each CARP, where 1 was allocated to poor visual acuity, 2 to partial, and 3 to good visual acuity. Similarly, rating scales were devised for the presence of concentric rings and the overall impression score awarded by the two designers involved in the design and manufacturing of the prostheses. This stereolithography measurement rubric (SMR) was then applied to the 35 STLs by a team of three experts, including the two designers, during a structured evaluation session. The scores were used to calculate summary and inferential statistics. Results: Scores grouped around the central rating of partial visual acuity. The three evaluators’ mean total CARP scores ranged from 13.1 to 14.4 (maximum possible score 24), while the mean total CARP + ring scores ranged from 15.8 to 17.1 (maximum possible score 27). No significant differences were detected between the evaluators’ scores. Conclusion: This SMR appears to be the first of its kind. This image quality assessment of STLs provides the groundwork for finer CT image quality evaluation to formulate a CT imaging protocol for the CRPM to design and manufacture accurate internal cranial prostheses. © 2022, The Author(s).","3D printing; CT image quality; Internal cranial prosthesis; STL; STL measurement rubric","Computerized tomography; Prosthetics; Quality control; Stereolithography; Vision; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Computed tomography image quality; Computed tomography images; Internal cranial prosthesis; Rapid manufacturing; Rapid-prototyping; Reference points; Stereolithography measurement rubric; Visual acuity; Article; computer assisted tomography; digital imaging and communications in medicine; image quality; prosthesis design; rating scale; stereolithography; visual acuity; Image quality","","","","","","","Arunachalam D., Thirumoorthy A., Devi S., Thennarasu, Quality of life in cancer patients with disfigurement due to cancer and its treatments.

The ability to achieve efficient and economical production of large size and complex structures of high-entropy alloy is of great significance to promoting its engineering application. Additive manufacturing is the key method to produce the complex component; however, the current trend in additive manufacturing of high-entropy alloys focuses on laser additive manufacturing, which is expensive and time-consuming. Herein, we developed a wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) method with high-efficiency and a low-cost Fe50Mn30Cr10Ni10 high-entropy alloy was successfully produced. The as-produced alloy was composed of face-centered cubic (FCC) phase with minor σ phase. Its microstructure mainly exhibited dendritic and cytosolic dendritic crystals. Mechanical strength of the additive manufactured alloy reached about 448 MPa with a high fracture elongation up to 80%. The additive manufactured alloy had good corrosion resistance with a protecting layer formed on the surface after corrosion testing, which was much better than 45 steel. Additionally, the frictional performance of the additive manufactured alloy was characterized against the grinding parts of steel and Al2O3 balls, and the corresponding friction mechanism was discussed. © 2022 by the authors.","corrosion resistance; high-entropy alloy; mechanical properties; wear performance; wire arc additive manufacturing","","","","","","Changsha Key R&D Program Project, (kh2201275); High-Tech Industry Science and Technology Innovation Leading Program of Hunan Province, (2020GK2085); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52005053, 92166105); Science and Technology Program of Hunan Province, (2021RC3096)","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 92166105 and 52005053), High-Tech Industry Science and Technology Innovation Leading Program of Hunan Province (No.2020GK2085), the Science and Technology Innovation Program of Hunan Province (No. 2021RC3096) and Changsha Key R&D Program Project (No. kh2201275).","Yeh J.-W., Chen S.K., Lin S.-J., Gan J.-Y., Chin T.-S., Shun T.-T., Tsau C.-H., Chang S.-Y., Nanostructured High-Entropy Alloys with Multiple Principal Elements: Novel Alloy Design Concepts and Outcomes, Adv.

The exceptions are two-unit bridges, as they are supported by a single tooth prepared only on one side of the missing tooth. The presented study deals with an analysis of a pressure force action on two-unit bridges placed in the frontal part (20 samples), where the pressure action is lower, and in the distal part (20 samples), where the pressure action is higher. A CAD program by 3Shape was used for digital designing with two different gap settings, 10 μm (20 samples) and 30 μm (20 samples). Two-unit bridges were attached to the prepared tooth using two types of dental cement (20/20 samples), which were selected for their physical and bioactive properties. All two-unit bridges (a total of 80 samples) were fabricated from CoCr alloys on Mlab cusing R by applying the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) technology. Mechanical testing was performed using the Inspekt5 table blue. The obtained data were used to verify the hypotheses—a difference between both types of cement (A ≠ B), a difference between the frontal and distal two-unit bridges (F ≠ D) and a difference between the gap sizes (10 ≠ 30). To confirm the given theories, data were statistically evaluated using the F-test and subsequent t-tests. The resulting p-value was compared with the level of significance (α = 0.05). A statistical evaluation revealed a significant difference between the compared groups; however, no explicit correlation between the individual groups of specimens was identified. © 2022 by the authors.","biomechanical testing; cobalt-chrome; dental cement; dental replacements; gap size","molybdenum; polycaprolactone; tooth cement; zinc phosphate; Article; biomechanics; bone density; cementation; corrosion; dentistry; finite element analysis; gingivitis; human; humidity; implantation; malocclusion; mechanical test; micro-computed tomography; periodontal disease; plate fixation; premolar tooth; selective laser melting; tooth plaque; tooth root; virtual reality","","molybdenum, 7439-98-7; polycaprolactone, 24980-41-4, 25248-42-4; zinc phosphate, 13847-22-8, 7779-90-0","","","Agentúra na Podporu Výskumu a Vývoja, APVV, (313011W410, APVV-17-0278, APVV-20-0068, ITMS2014); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","This research was supported by project KEGA 050TUKE-4/2022—Additive manufacturing in medicine—creation of multimedia material and tools to support teaching in biomedical engineering.

Three-dimensional bioprinting has demonstrated its advantages as one of the major methods in fabricating simple tissues, yet it still faces difficulties to generate vasculatures and preserve cell functions in complex organ production. Here, we overcome the limitations of conventional bioprinting systems by converting a six degree-of-freedom robotic arm into a bioprinter, therefore enables cell printing on 3D complex-shaped vascular scaffolds from all directions. We also developed an oil bath-based cell printing method to better preserve cell natural functions after printing. Together with a self-designed bioreactor and a repeated print-and-culture strategy, our bioprinting system is capable to generate vascularized, contractible, and long-term survived cardiac tissues. Such bioprinting strategy mimics the in vivo organ development process and presents a promising solution for in vitro fabrication of complex organs. © 2022 The Authors","3D bioprinting; Artificial organ engineering; Cardiac tissue fabrication; Print-and-culture; Six degree-of-freedom robot","angiogenesis; Article; blood vessel; cardiac muscle cell; cell activity; cell culture; cell cycle assay; cell function; cell survival; cell viability; fluorescence activated cell sorting; heart tissue; human; human cell; human embryonic stem cell; immunohistochemistry; nanofabrication; three dimensional bioprinting","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61725204, 81790622); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (XDA16020801)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by CAS Strategic Priority Research Program grants ( XDA16020801 to X.-J.W.), the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 81790622 to X.-J.

The key idea was to avert heat buildup in a LPBF part before it is printed by adapting process parameters layer-by-layer based on insights from a physics-based thermal simulation model. The motivation being to replace cumbersome empirical build-and-test parameter optimization with a physics-guided strategy. The approach consisted of three steps: prediction, analysis, and correction. First, the temperature distribution of a part was predicted rapidly using a graph theory-based computational thermal model. Second, the model-derived thermal trends were analyzed to isolate layers of potential heat buildup. Third, heat buildup in affected layers was corrected before printing by adjusting process parameters optimized through iterative simulations. The effectiveness of the approach was demonstrated experimentally on two separate build plates. In the first build plate, termed fixed processing, ten different nickel alloy 718 parts were produced under constant processing conditions. On a second identical build plate, called controlled processing, the laser power and dwell time for each part was adjusted before printing based on thermal simulations to avoid heat buildup. To validate the thermal model predictions, the surface temperature of each part was tracked with a calibrated infrared thermal camera. Post-process the parts were examined with non-destructive and destructive materials characterization techniques. Compared to fixed processing, parts produced under controlled processing showed superior geometric accuracy and resolution, finer grain size, increased microhardness, and reduced surface roughness. © 2022 The Authors","Feedforward process control; Graph theory; Laser powder bed fusion; Physics-based parameter optimization; Thermal history simulations","Computation theory; Feedforward control; Iterative methods; Laser theory; Process control; Surface roughness; Feed forward; Feedforward process control; Heat buildup; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Parameter optimization; Physic-based parameter optimization; Physics-based; Powder bed; Thermal history simulation; Graph theory","","","","","EWI Additive Manufacturing; Nanoengineering Research Core Facility; National Science Foundation, NSF, (EEC1953382); National Science Foundation, NSF; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (2025298, CMMI-1719388, CMMI-1739696, CMMI-1752069, CMMI-1920245, DE-SC0021136, ECCS-2020246, OIA-1929172, PFI-TT 2044710); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; University of Nebraska-Lincoln, UNL","Funding text 1: The X-ray CT analysis was conducted on the instrument partially funded through the Major Research instrumentation grant (CMMI-1920245, program officer: Wendy C.

Despite the dual-phase lattices have more better energy absorption capability and compression performance than the single pure lattice, limited mechanical properties still exist in the dual-phase lattices. In this work, a novel mixed structural design strategy is proposed and the specimens are fabricated by selective laser sintering. Both experimental test and numerical evaluation are conducted to validate the rationality of the proposed design strategy. Results indicate that the novel mixed lattice can achieve the higher energy absorption and lightweight in comparison with the pure and dual-phase lattice. The energy absorption efficiency could be adjusted by altering the types or sizes of basic unit cells. The proposed analytical methods can well predict the plateau stress of the mixed lattices with various geometrical dimensions. The finding of this work contributes to the designs of lattice structures with energy absorption and superior mechanical properties. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Mixed lattice structures; The analytical prediction; The densification strain; The maximum energy absorption; The specific energy absorption","Absorption efficiency; Laser heating; Sintering; Structural design; Dual phase; Lattice structures; Mixed lattice structure; The analytical prediction; The densification strain; The maximum energy absorption; The specific energy absorption; Energy absorption","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52171290, 52225108); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","The authors would like to thank the support from the National Natural Science of China under Grant No. 52225108 and Grant No. 52171290 .","Cetin E., Baykasoglu C., Energy absorption of thin-walled tubes enhanced by lattice structures, Int.

One solution to this problem is to split ventilators between multiple patients, which poses the difficulty of treating two patients with dissimilar ventilation needs. A proposed solution to this problem is the use of 3D-printed flow splitters and restrictors. There is little data available on the reliability of such devices and how the use of different 3D printing methods might affect their performance. Methods: We performed flow resistance measurements on 30 different 3D-printed restrictor designs produced using a range of fused deposition modelling and stereolithography printers and materials, from consumer grade printers using polylactic acid filament to professional printers using surgical resin. We compared their performance to novel computational fluid dynamics models driven by empirical ventilator flow rate data. This indicates the ideal performance of a part that matches the computer model. Results: The 3D-printed restrictors varied considerably between printers and materials to a sufficient degree that would make them unsafe for clinical use without individual testing. This occurs because the interior surface of the restrictor is rough and has a reduced nominal average diameter when compared to the computer model. However, we have also shown that with careful calibration it is possible to tune the end-inspiratory (tidal) volume by titrating the inspiratory time on the ventilator. Conclusions: Computer simulations of differential multi patient ventilation indicate that the use of 3D-printed flow splitters is viable.

This work presents a characterization of G, P, and D-type triply periodic minimal surfaces-based scaffolds, manufactured by fused deposition modeling, with different printing parameters and porosity values of 50 and 70%. Thermal characterization was carried out by Thermogravimetric Analysis, Differential Thermal Analysis and Differential Scanning Calorimetry. Morphology was studied by scanning electron microscopy and micro axial computed tomography. The analyses showed a noticeable change in the crystallinity of the scaffolds that were printed in the temperature interval 210 °C to 220 °C.

Additive manufacturing (AM), due to its extremely high cooling rates, can generate a refined microstructure that is beneficial to yield strength. However, the intrinsic steep thermal gradients within melt pools often lead to development of columnar grains that can result in mechanical anisotropy. To address these issues, we propose to use potent β-stabilizing elements with large growth restriction factors as the main solute elements in Ti, specifically Fe and Co. D-electron theory is also used to design the detailed compositions of the new titanium alloys for AM. A novel metastable titanium alloy, Ti-xFe-xCo-1Mo (1.5 < x < 3.5 at%), is thus developed by laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF). With process optimization, the L-PBF-processed alloy was found to contain fully equiaxed β grains embedded with α laths and ω precipitates and the grain boundaries decorated by Ti2Co precipitates. The matrix consists of a certain number of micro-sized β flecks and a high density of Fe and Mo atomic clusters. Upon solution treatment (ST), the microstructure turned into equiaxed β grains embedded with ultrafine ω precipitates and Mo atomic clusters. While the L-PBF-processed alloy shows poor tensile properties probably due to the presence of isothermal ω precipitates, the L-PBF-ST-processed alloy demonstrates an unprecedented yield strength of 1.2 GPa and a decent elongation of 10–12%. The alloy deformed by dislocation slipping and failed in a ductile fracture mode. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Columnar-to-equiaxed transition; Deformation mechanism; Laser powder bed fusion; Tensile property; Titanium alloy","3D printers; Additives; Cobalt alloys; Ductile fracture; Grain boundaries; Iron; Molybdenum; Optimization; Textures; Yield stress; Atomic clusters; Beta-titanium alloys; Columnar-to-equiaxed transition; Deformation mechanism; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Metastables; Powder bed; Solution treatments; Titanium (alloys); Titanium alloys","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST, (2018YFB0703400); Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","Funding: This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China from the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People’s Republic of China (grant No. 2018YFB0703400, 2018 ).

Previously, the process feasibility has been demonstrated to join injection-molded Ti-6Al-4V and extruded unreinforced and laminated glass-fiber-reinforced polyetherimide structures, resulting in joints with improved out-of-plane strength and fatigue performance. However, there is an unexplored field concerning the joinability of additively manufactured (AM) metal and polymer parts via U-Joining. AM allows the production of structures with complex designs, but joining AM parts can represent a challenge as defects might appear along the process, such as delamination. In this work, the feasibility of joining laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) 316L stainless steel and fused filament fabricated (FFF) poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK) via U-Joining is demonstrated. Optical and scanning electron microscopy showed that TTRs were fully inserted into the polymer and that molten PEEK could flow around and penetrate metal surface cavities, thereby improving the macro- and micromechanical interlocking between the parts. Finally, quasi-static lap shear tests were performed, showing an improvement in the ultimate lap shear force up to 2.8 times (from 1.1 ± 0.2 kN to 3.2 ± 0.2 kN) and the displacement at break up to 2.1 times (from 0.7 ± 0.1 mm to 1.45 ± 0.2 mm) when compared to unreinforced (flat pinless) reference joints produced with the same energy input. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Fused filament fabrication; Hybrid structures; Laser powder bed fusion; Ultrasonic joining","","","","","","","","(2021); Das D., Sharma S.K., Parti R., Singh J., Analyzing the effect of aviation infrastructure over aviation fuel consumption reduction, J.

In the present study, comparison of microstructure and high-temperature electrochemical behaviours between LPBF 316 and wrought 316 in simulated pressurized water reactor environment was made. Three heat treatments, stress relieving (SR), solution annealing (SA) and hot isostatic pressing (HIP), were used to heat treat the LPBF 316. The results showed that both the yield strength and impact energy of the SA and HIP treated LPBF 316 were lower than that of the SR treated sample, whilst the tensile elongation of the SA and HIP treated samples was higher than SR treated sample. These changes were found to be due to the disappearance of the cellular structures, decrease in the dislocation density and the occurrence of recrystallization during the treatments. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements at 288 °C and their interpretation with the Mixed-Conduction Model indicated that corrosion rate of the heat-treated LPBF 316 variants is significantly lower than that of the wrought 316. In addition, SR material exhibits marginally lower corrosion rates than SA and HIP ones. Microstructure examination after high-temperature water exposure revealed an inhomogeneous inner oxide layer on LPBF 316 in contrast to the thicker and more uniform inner oxide layer on wrought 316. The localised nature of electrochemical processes is suggested to be induced by the nano-precipitates in the LPBF samples. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Austenitic stainless steel; Electrochemical behaviour; Heat treatment; High-temperature water","3D printers; Additives; Corrosion rate; Electrochemical corrosion; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; High temperature corrosion; Hot isostatic pressing; Microstructure; Pressurized water reactors; 316 stainless steel; Additive manufacturing technology; Electrochemical behaviors; High-temperature water; Hot-isostatic pressings; Laser powders; Localized electrochemical process; Oxide layer; Powder bed; Solution annealing; Austenitic stainless steel","","","","","Aalto-Yliopisto; VTT; Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics; Horizon 2020; University of Manchester; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (755151); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (E051011031, 632/31/2018, SAFIR 23/2020, 628/31/2018)","The work is funded by VTT Substance Node Excellence Canva (GG_PIETU_Node), EU Horizon 2020 project MEACTOS (EURATOM research and training programme 2014\u20132018 under grant agreement no. 755151) and Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. E051011031).

To elaborate on this topic, in situ AE monitoring was applied to L-PBF manufacturing of a high-strength Al92Mn6Ce2 (at. %) alloy and combined with subsequent X-ray computed tomography. By using a structure borne high-frequency sensor, even a simple threshold-based monitoring was able to detect AE activity associated with cracking, which occurred not only during L-PBF itself, but also after the build job was completed, i.e. in the cooling phase. AE data analysis revealed that crack-related signals can easily be separated from the background noise (e.g. inert gas circulation pump) through their specific shape of a waveform, as well as their energy, skewness and kurtosis. Thus, AE was verified to be a promising method for L-PBF monitoring, enabling to detect formation of cracks regardless of their spatial and temporal occurrence. © 2022 The Author(s)","Acoustic emission; Additive manufacturing; Aluminium alloy; Crack detection; Laser powder bed fusion; Monitoring; X-ray computed tomography","","","","","","","","Gong G., Ye J., Chi Y., Zhao Z., Wang Z., Xia G., Du X., Tian H., Yu H., Chen C., Research status of laser additive manufacturing for metal: a review, J.

The PBF process parameters have been systematically altered, such as laser scan speed from 0.4 Å/ps to 0.1 Å/ps, 1–4 unidirectional and reversing laser passes, as well as laser power from 100 µW to 220 µW, following previous literature. The results suggest that reducing the laser scanning speed up to a critical velocity of 0.2 Å/ps considerably improves mechanical strengths, however further speed reduction creates severe surface defects. Alternatively, the material's strengths could be effectively improved by annealing with multiple unidirectional laser passes over the same target area, rather than reversing the direction after subsequent passes. Interestingly, increasing laser power aids in the amelioration of material density ultimately leading to higher ultimate tensile strength (UTS) even in non-dislocation free structures. Dislocation analysis reveals that for single laser pass situations, the annihilation of the bulk sessile dislocations during tensile straining marks an early yield failure, leading to decreased UTS. Whereas, the yield points are more subtle in annealed blocks, allowing them to achieve higher UTS. Likewise, fewer sessile dislocations and stacking faults correspond to better ultimate compressive strength (UCS), although the compressive yield points are usually indistinguishable in most instances. Present atomistic findings enable researchers in understanding the underlying effects and help in the process optimization of emerging microscale additive manufacturing processes. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Dislocations; FeNiCrCoCu High entropy alloy; Laser heating; Mechanical strength; Molecular dynamics simulation; Powder bed fusion process","Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Compressive strength; Copper alloys; Entropy; High-entropy alloys; Iron alloys; Optimization; Stacking faults; Surface defects; Tensile strength; Dislocation; Dynamics simulation; Fenicrcocu high entropy alloy; Fusion process; High entropy alloys; Mechanical; Mechanical strength; Molecular dynamic simulation; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion process; Molecular dynamics","","","","","Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, IICT; Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, BUET; National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, NICT","The authors gratefully acknowledge the high-performance computing facilities provided by the Institute of Information and Communication Technology (IICT), BUET in conducting this research.

Hence, optimizing process parameters to maintain a constant melt-pool size during the build process could potentially improve the build quality of the final part. This paper considers the optimal control of laser power, while keeping other process parameters fixed, to achieve a constant melt-pool size during the laser scanning of a multi-track build under L-PBF. First, Gaussian process regression (GPR) is applied to model the dynamic evolution of the melt-pool size as a function of laser power and thermal history, which are defined as the input features of the GPR model. Then a constrained finite-horizon optimal control problem is formulated, with a quadratic cost function defined to minimize the difference between the controlled melt-pool size and its reference value. A projected gradient descent algorithm is applied to compute the optimal sequence of laser power in the proposed control problem. The GPR modeling is demonstrated using simulated data sets, a mix of simulated and experimental data sets, or pure experimental data sets. Numerical verification of the control design of laser power is performed on a commercial AM software, Autodesk’s Netfabb Simulation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GPR modeling and model-based optimal control in regulating the melt-pool size during the scanning of multi-tracks using L-PBF. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Gaussian process regression; Laser powder bed fusion; Melt-pool geometry; Multi-track; Optimal control","Cost functions; Gaussian distribution; Lakes; Optimal control systems; Power control; Software testing; Verification; Gaussian process regression; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Laser power; Melt pool; Melt pool size; Melt-pool geometry; Multi tracks; Optimal controls; Powder bed; Process control","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2015930); National Science Foundation, NSF; Center for Selective C-H Functionalization, National Science Foundation; Center for Hierarchical Manufacturing, National Science Foundation, CHM, NSF","This project was financed in part by a grant from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Community and Economic Development.

The friction and wear behaviour of printed materials were systematically investigated under both dry sliding and water lubricated conditions. The results showed that with short fibre enhancements, the printed SCFRN achieved a lower friction coefficient and higher wear resistance than nylon under all tested conditions. Further, under water lubricated conditions, the printed SCFRN exhibited a low, stable friction coefficient due to the cooling and lubricating effects of water. However, the specific wear rate of the printed specimens could be higher than that obtained under dry sliding conditions, especially when the load was relatively low. The square textured surface was designed and created in the printing process to improve materials’ tribological performance. It was found that with the textured surface, the wear resistance of the printed SCFRN was improved under dry sliding conditions, which could be explained by the debris collection or cleaning effect of surface texture. However, such a cleaning effect was less noticeable under lubricated conditions, as the liquid could clean the surface effectively. On the other hand, surface textures could increase the surface area exposed to water, causing surface softening due to the higher water absorption rate. As a result, the samples having surface textures showed higher wear rates under lubricated conditions. The work has provided new insights into designing wear resistant polymer materials using three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies, subjected to different sliding conditions.

It is a promising post-processing technique for many different additive manufacturing laser powder bed fusion processes due to its high accuracy and flexibility within the manufacturing cycle. Nickel-based superalloys like Inconel 718, which are often used in turbine blades, are particularly suitable for laser surface remelting due to their complex geometries and the flexibility that laser surface remelting provides. Studying the microstructural and mechanical alterations that result from laser surface remelting is crucial to advancing and better understanding how laser surface modification techniques can improve additively manufactured alloys. In this study, mechanical and microstructural analysis techniques such as nanoindentation, scanning electron microscopy, and electron backscatter diffraction were utilized to investigate the effects of laser surface remelting on additively manufactured Inconel 718. The subsurface of the laser-remelted material exhibited decreases in nanohardness up to approximately 20 pct which was primarily attributed to increased dendritic spacing that resulted from re-solidification of the laser remelted region in addition to the columniation of epitaxial grains towards the highest temperature within the thermal gradient. This study investigated the laser remelting process at a laser power of 160 W along a single pass with scan speeds between 3 and 42 mm/s. An inverse relationship between the scan speeds during the remelting procedure and the size of the remelted zones was also exhibited, which was related to the cooling rates at different laser fluences which greatly influenced the thermal gradient within the remelted zone. © 2022, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.","","Additives; Grain refinement; Laser heating; Nickel alloys; Remelting; Scanning electron microscopy; Solidification; Superalloys; Turbomachine blades; Engineering techniques; Inconel-718; Laser surface remelting; Mechanical; Mechanical characterizations; Micro-structural properties; Microstructural characterizations; Morphological characterization; Resolidification; Scan speed; Thermal gradients","","","","","Air Force Research Lab Summer Faculty; Air Force Research Lab Summer Faculty; National Science Foundation, NSF; Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation, CMMI, (2029059)","Funding text 1: The project was supported by the National Science Foundation, CMMI, Advanced Manufacturing Program (Award Number: 2029059).

However, Nickel-based alloy is a typical difficult-to-machine material, which is a great constrain for its application in the manufacturing field. To improve the surface quality of the ground workpiece, a new high-shear and low-pressure grinding wheel, with high ratio of tangential grinding force to normal grinding force, was fabricated for the grinding of selective laser melting (SLM) manufactured Inconel718 alloy. The principle of high-shear and low-pressure grinding process was introduced in detail, which was quite different from the conventional grinding process. The fabrication process of the new grinding wheel was illustrated. A serial of experiments with different processing parameters were carried out to investigate the grinding performance of the developed grinding wheel via analyzing surface roughness and surface morphology of the ground workpiece. The optimal processing parameters of high-shear and low-pressure grinding were obtained. The surface roughness of ground workpiece was reduced to 0.232 μm from the initial value of 0.490 μm under the optimal grinding conditions. It was found that the initial scratches on the ground workpiece were almost completely removed after the observations with the metalloscopy and the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The capability of the newly developed high-shear and low-pressure grinding wheel was validated. © 2021 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics","Grinding; Grinding wheel; High-shear and low-pressure grinding;

This is detrimental to the final manufactured part, as it risks the incorporation of defects. It is therefore important to study this spattering behavior and to apply the knowledge gained to further improve the L-PBF process. This work introduces the use of a high-speed plenoptic camera to acquire 3D spatter particle trajectories generated via L-PBF line tracks. Spatter particles are tracked in the volume above the laser-metal interaction zone at 1000 fps and their velocity calculated. It is found that the calculated speeds of the spatter particles are within the expected range for this process, and that the behavior is a complex 3-dimensional process. © 2022 The Authors","Additive Manufacturing; High-Speed Imaging; Laser-Powder Bed Fusion; Metal; Particle Tracking; Plenoptic Camera; Spatter","","","","","","","","Gu D.D., Meiners W., Wissenbach K., Poprawe R., Laser additive manufacturing of metallic components: materials, processes and mechanisms, Int.

The 4D printing has the capacity to fabricate dynamic construction conforming to the natural bending of biological tissues, superior to other manufacturing techniques. In this study, we presented a multi-responsive, flexible, and biocompatible 4D-printed bilayer hydrogel based on acrylamide-acrylic acid/cellulose nanocrystal (AAm-AAc/CNC) network. The first layer was first stretched and then formed reversible coordination with Fe3+ to maintain this pre-stretched length; it was later combined with a second layer. The deformation process was actuated by the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ in the first layer which restored it to its initial length. The deformation condition was to immerse the 4D construct in sodium lactate (LA-Na) and then expose it to ultraviolet (UV) light until maximal deformation was realized. The bending degree of this 4D construct can be programmed by modifying the pre-stretched lengths of the first layer. We explored various deformation steps in simple and complex constructs to verify that the 4D bilayer hydrogel can mimic the curved morphology of the intestines. The bilayer hydrogel can also curve in deionized water due to anisotropic volume change yet the response time and maximum bending degree was inferior to deformation in LA-Na and UV light. Finally, we made a 4D-printed bilayer hydrogel stent to test its closure effect for enteroatmospheric fistulas (EAFs) in vitro and in vivo. The results illustrate that the hydrogel plays a role in the temporary closure of EAFs. This study offers an effective method to produce curved structures and expands the potential applications of 4D printing in biomedical fields. © 2022 The Authors","4D printing; Enteroatmospheric fistula; Hydrogel; Plugging technique; Shape morphing","Amides; Bending; Deformation; Length; Light; Printing; Shape; Structures; Acrylic monomers; Amides; Binary alloys; Biocompatibility; Deionized water; 4d printing; Bi-layer; Dynamic construction; Enteroatmospheric fistula; Fe 3+; Plugging technique; Shape morphing; Shape morphing structures; Ultra-violet light; Ultraviolet lights; Hydrogels","","","","","Distinguished Scholars Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (JCRCB2016006); Jiangsu Key Research and Development Plan, (BE2021727); Jiangsu Commission of Health, (M2020052); Jiangsu Commission of Health","This work was supported by Distinguished Scholars Foundation of Jiangsu Province ( JCRCB2016006 ), Jiangsu Key Research and Development Plan ( BE2021727 ), and General Program of Medical Research from the Jiangsu Commission of Health ( M2020052 ).","Terzi C., Egeli T., Canda A.E., Arslan N.C., Management of enteroatmospheric fistulae, Int.

Subsequently, the L-PBF-built parts were hot isostatic pressed (HIP), homogenized, and aged. Ultrasonic surface mechanical treatment was applied to modify the surface texture and microstructural layer of the L-PBF-built and heat-treated Inconel 718 alloy parts. Ultrasonic impact treatment (UIT) was implemented using a forcedly rotated multi-pin impact head. The surface texture, roughness, waviness, porosity, microstructure, phase composition, hardness, and residual stresses of the L-PBF-built and thermo-mechanical post-processed specimens were studied and compared. The results revealed that the UIT post-processing leads to work hardening, induces compressive residual stresses, and ∼20% increase in the surface microhardness in the near-surface layer of the heat-treated L-PBF-built 718 alloy parts. The surface roughness and waviness were significantly reduced after UIT, providing a flattened surface microrelief formation. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Inconel 718; Laser powder bed fusion; Microstructure; Thermo-mechanical post-processing; Ultrasonic surface modification","","","","","","","","Vock S., Kloden B., Kirchner A., Weissgarber T., Kieback B., Powders for powder bed fusion: a review, Prog.

However, the digital workflow of patient-specific maxillofacial prostheses (MFP) remains incomplete, and several steps in the manufacturing process are still labor-intensive and are costly in both time and resources. Despite the high demand for direct digital MFP manufacturing, three-dimensional (3D) printing of colored silicone MFP is limited by the processing routes of medical-grade silicones and biocompatible elastomers. In this study, a binder jetting 3D printing process with polyvinyl butyral (PVB)-coated silicone powder was developed for direct 3D printing of MFP. Nanosilica-treated silicone powder was spray dried with PVB by controlling the Ohnesorge number and processing parameters. After printing, the interconnected pores were infused with silicone and hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDS) by pressure-vacuum sequential infiltration to produce the final parts. Particle size, coating composition, surface treatment, and infusion conditions influenced the mechanical properties of the 3D-printed preform, and of the final infiltrated structure. In addition to demonstrating the feasibility of using silicone powder-based 3D printing for MFP, these results can be used to inform the modifications required to accommodate the manufacturing of other biocompatible elastomeric materials.

In this work, a radially graded lattice structure (RGLS), which mimics the structures of natural human bones, was designed and processed by laser powder bed fusion of martensitic Ti-rich TiNi powder. The asymmetric tension-compression behaviour, where the compressive strength is significantly higher than the tensile strength, is observed in this Ti-rich TiNi material, which echoes the mechanical behaviour of bones. The morphologies, mechanical properties, deformation behaviour, and biological compatibility of RGLS samples were characterised and compared with those in the uniform lattice structure. Both the uniform and RGLS samples achieve a relative density higher than 99%. The graded porosities and pore sizes in the RGLS range from 40%-80% and 330-805 μm, respectively, from the centre to the edge. The chemical etching has significantly removed the harmful partially-melted residual powder particles on the lattice struts. The compressive yield strength of RGLS is 71.5 MPa, much higher than that of the uniform sample (46.5 MPa), despite having a similar relative density of about 46%. The calculated Gibson-Ashby equation and the deformation behaviour simulation by finite element suggest that the dense outer regions with high load-bearing capability could sustain high applied stress, improving the overall strength of RGLS significantly. The cell proliferation study suggests better biological compatibility of the RGLS than the uniform structures. The findings highlight a novel strategy to improve the performance of additively manufactured artificial implants by bio-inspiration.  © 2022 The Author(s).

In this study, the panels' flexural behaviors and vibration-damping capabilities produced in different infill patterns (Grid, Cross, and Tri-hexagon) and different infill ratios (0 %, 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 80 %, and 100 %) were investigated. The specimen dimensions were 12.7 mm in width, 127 mm in length, and 3.2 mm in thickness. A biopolymer polylactic acid (PLA) filament with Ø 1.75 mm was used to produce test specimens. Fused Deposition Modeling is a modern additive manufacturing technique; however, optimization is needed to enhance the properties of 3D-printed parts. The flexural properties, as well as vibration-damping characteristics of the 3D-printed specimen, were evaluated experimentally. The results show that the infill pattern and ratio significantly affect flexural behavior and vibration-damping properties. The flexural tests showed that the highest flexural strength was obtained in the Tri-hexagon pattern, while the highest damping capability was obtained on Cross pattern specimens. Additionally, with the increasing infill ratio, the flexural modulus, and flexural strength increase. The specific strength value obtained for the 20 % fill rate for all patterns was observed as maximum Best damping properties were obtained on a 40 % infill ratio with all the different tested patterns. This study also showed that infill pattern and ratio design could improve the plastic parts' properties, and 3D printing provides an easy way to test the properties of different infill patterns and ratios. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3D Printing; Flexural strength; Fused deposition modeling; Modal analysis; Vibration damping","Bending strength; Biopolymers; Damping; Deposition; Fused Deposition Modeling; Infill drilling; Layered manufacturing; Vibration analysis; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Damping capability; Damping characteristics; Damping property; Flexural behavior; Flexural vibrations; Printing technologies; Property; Vibration-damping; Modal analysis","","","","","Eskişehir Osmangazi Üniversitesi, ESOGU","This work was supported by a research program supported by Eskisehir Osmangazi University .","Ngo T.D., Kashani A., Imbalzano G., Nguyen K.T.Q., Hui D., Additive manufacturing (3D printing): a review of materials, methods, applications and challenges, Compos.

The operating temperature of the process ranges from − 20 to − 25 °C. Cryo-3DP demands high cooling rates initially to reach the process temperature followed by lower cooling rates to sustain it. Multimodal freezing system proposed in this study uses more than one cooling mode that helps in achieving the variable cooling rates. The present system uses two modes of cooling, viz., vapor compression refrigeration (VCR) and CO2 injection. A detailed design of the multimodal freezing system is carried out for the chamber size of 200 mm × 200 mm × 195 mm. The performance of the system is analysed numerically. The results were experimentally validated using the prototype of the multimodal system developed as a part of the present study. The results show that the multimodal system reduces the initial cooling time substantially by providing a high cooling rate that rapidly cools the chamber to initiate the cryo-3DP. VCR system provides a low but sustained cooling rate that maintains the desired temperature. The present study proves the significance of multimodality in cooling system that is fit to deploy in a commercial cryogenic 3D printer. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Additive manufacturing; Cooling technology; Cryogenic 3D printing; Multimodal freezing system; Vapor compression refrigeration","","","","","","Key Deployment Research Program of XIOPM, (S19-020-III); Open Research Fund of Key Laboratory of Spectral Imaging Technology of the CAS, (LSIT201807G); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51877210, 52177166); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (J20-021-III); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, (2020JM-309); Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi Province, (2019JCW-03)","The authors acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51877210, 52177166), the Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province (Grant No. 2020JM-309), the Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi (Grant No. 2019JCW-03), the Key Deployment Research Program of XIOPM (Grant No. S19-020-III), the Major Science and Technology Infrastructure Pre-research Program of the CAS (Grant No. J20-021-III), and the Open Research Fund of Key Laboratory of Spectral Imaging Technology of the CAS (Grant No. LSIT201807G).

Five groups of additive manufacturing experiments were carried out using carbon fiber filament, and the considered infill density values were 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 80 %, and 100 %, respectively. Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors were selected as measurement sensors to monitor internal temperature change of all prototypes during additive manufacturing process. Monitoring tests indicate that fabrication of carbon fiber filament in additive manufacturing method leads to a significant temperature rise of FBG sensors. The obtained relationship of temperature change against printing time is characterized by three different typical phases including an initial temperature rise in the first stage, a gradual temperature reduction in the second stage, and a temperature decrease after printing is finished in the third stage. It is found that the peak value of temperature raised from 5.0 ℃ to 12.6 ℃ in the second stage when infill densities increased from 20 % to 100 %. The maximum peak value of temperature raised about 9.7–19.8 ℃ in the third stage. The obtained decrease rates of inner temperature change were − 0.289 ℃/layer, − 0.334 ℃/layer, − 0.304 ℃/layer, − 0.303 ℃/layer, and − 0.294 ℃/layer, respectively. The monitoring test data provide a better understanding of temperature change of carbon fiber filament and therefore can be further used to indicate thermal expansion and contraction during additive manufacturing process. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Carbon fiber; FBG; Inner temperature","3D printers; Additives; Carbon fibers; Electric sensing devices; Fiber optic sensors; Infill drilling; Thermal expansion; Additive manufacturing process; Density value; Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors; Fibre-optic sensor; Inner temperature; Internal temperature; Measurement sensor; Peak values; Temperature changes; Temperature rise; Fiber Bragg gratings","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52078303)","Financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 52078303 ) is greatly appreciated.

Compared to the conventional FEM using the global stiffness approach and a uniform mesh running on 10 CPU cores, L-PBF process simulation based on the proposed methodology running on a GPU card with 5,120 Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) cores enables a speedup of over 10,000x. This significant speedup facilitates detailed thermal history and melt pool geometry predictions at high resolution for centimeter-scale parts within days of computation time.

Here, we investigate micro and mesostructure, and corresponding mechanical properties, of a compositionally-graded Al-Si alloy that has been processed using commercially available AlSi5 and AlSi12 feeding wires in a dual-wire arc DED system. Microstructure characterization shows a chemical gradient from about 6.5–9.5 wt% Si along the build direction that correlates with increasing hardness values ranging from ∼ 40 HV0.5 to ∼ 65 HV0.5 and increasing tensile strength in both orthogonal orientations. While sample ductility is affected by testing orientation, the micro and mesostructure impart negligible anisotropy to the fracture resistance. Both strength and failure characteristics are associated with a mismatch in local strain deformation capacity between the α-Al dendrites and the eutectic Al-Si regions that affect the melt pool boundaries and the interior of melt pools differently. As a result, anisotropic tensile ductility results are controlled by the initiation of failure at the melt pool boundaries while the constant fracture toughness values for different orientations are mainly controlled by decohesion of the two phases and subsequent crack bridging with crack extension. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Compositionally-graded materials (CGMs); In-situ alloying; Microstructure and mesostructure; Strength and crack-extension resistance curve (R-curve) behavior; Wire-arc directed energy deposition","Alloying; Aluminum alloys; Anisotropy; Cracks; Deposition rates; Ductility; Fracture; Fracture testing; Fracture toughness; Silicon alloys; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Wire; Compositionally graded materials; Compositionally-graded material; Crack extension resistance; Directed energy; Energy depositions; In-situ alloying; Mesostructures; Microstructure and mesostructure; Resistance curve behavior; Strength and crack-extension resistance curve  behavior; Wire arc; Wire-arc directed energy deposition; Microstructure","","","","","Austrian Federal Ministry BMDW, (879875); Australian Research Council, ARC, (FT190100484); Australian Research Council, ARC; University of New South Wales, UNSW; Österreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft, FFG","This research was funded by the Austrian Federal Ministry BMDW through the project “CARAMPA” (Grant no. 879875 ) which was administered by the FFG.

Currently, the systematic research works on additive manufacturing of thin-walled components are rarely reported, making it impossible to properly supervise the production of complicated thin-walled parts. The aim of present study was to investigate the effects of thickness on the microstructure and mechanical characteristics of thin-walled Ti6Al4V alloy produced by SLM. As the thickness increased from 0.5 mm to 2.0 mm, surface roughness decreased from 15.702 μm to 5.769 μm, ultimate tensile strength grew from 1052 MPa to 1313 MPa while elongation initially increased and then decreased (all <8%). The microstructure, which has a hierarchical structure with tensile twins, dislocations (dislocation loops), and stacking faults, is dominated by martensite. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Mechanical properties; Selective laser melting; Thin-walled structure; Ti6Al4V","Aluminum alloys; Industrial research; Melting; Microstructural evolution; Selective laser melting; Surface roughness; Tensile strength; Ternary alloys; Thin walled structures; Effects of thickness; Mechanical characteristics; Microstructure characteristics; Selective laser melting; Systematic research; Tensile behaviors; Thin walled components; Thin-walled; Thin-walled parts; Thin-walled structures; Titanium alloys","","","","","Xi'an Science and technology plan project, (21XJZZ0051); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51874225); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51874225 ), Xi'an Science and technology plan project ( 21XJZZ0051 ).","Shen Z., Su H., Liu H., Et al., Directly fabricated Al2O3/GdAlO3 eutectic ceramic with large smooth surface by selective laser melting: rapid solidification behavior and thermal field simulation, J.

Controlling the quality of the additively manufactured FRP is critical to guarantee an FRP material of high performance for different applications. Therefore, in this research, a machine learning model based on data collected from experimental studies was developed using the artificial neural network (ANN) modeling method to control the quality of FRP manufactured by fused deposition modeling (FDM) printing technology. ANN model predicts the tensile properties, particularly ultimate tensile strength (UTS), of the FRP as a function of 7 material and printing parameters, which are fiber tensile strength, polymer tensile strength, layer thickness, fiber volume fraction, fiber form, infill pattern, and fiber orientation. A parametric study was conducted to confirm the credibility of the developed ANN model in representing the pairwise relationship between each input parameter and the predicted UTS. The UTS of the FRP was maximized by optimizing the printing and material parameters by using the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. Several case studies were conducted to prove the efficiency of the coupled ANN model and optimization algorithm. The ANN modeling method and ABC algorithm were codified and applied using MATLAB software. The results showed that the developed ANN model could accurately predict the UTS of FRP. The parametric study confirmed that the developed ANN model was valid for representing the pairwise relationships between the input parameters and the predicted UTS. Also, it was found that the fiber properties, fiber form, fiber orientation, and fiber volume fraction have the highest influence on the UTS of FRP manufactured by FDM compared with other parameters. Furthermore, the ABC optimization algorithm can design the input parameters (i.e., material and printing parameters) to obtain an FRP with maximum UTS. For future studies, it is recommended to include more input parameters, such as printing speed, nozzle temperature, and infill density, in addition to outputs, such as impact and flexural properties. © 2022 Institution of Structural Engineers","3D printing; Artificial Bee Colony algorithm; Artificial neural network; Fiber-reinforced polymer; Optimization","","","","","","School of Civil Engineering in Tongji University; Shanghai Government Scholarship Council","This research was supported by the Shanghai Government Scholarship Council (SGS) and the School of Civil Engineering in Tongji University.

Zinc-ion microbatteries (ZIMBs) are reliable MI-ESS candidates with excellent electrochemical potential; however, the viability and real application of conventional ZIMBs are long stricted by low device capacity/reversibility and challenging device package design. Herein, we report an all-3D-printing design of solid-state ultrahigh-capacity and highly reversible ZIMBs and achieve an advanced wearable integration. Calcium vanadate nanoribbon-based cathode and Zn nanosheet-based anode are rationally constructed by direct ink writing-based 3D printing. With a Cu-modification, dendrite-suppressed anode affords a low polarization and stable voltage profiles during long-term Zn plating/stripping. 3D printed solid-state ZIMBs deliver an outstanding device capacity of 8.9 mAh cm−2, which surpasses previously reported ZIMBs and even lithium-ion microbatteries. Superior rate capability and cycling stability is also achieved. By regulating 3D printing parameters, an ultrahigh device capacity reaches at 14.9 mAh cm−2. Furthermore, vat photopolymerization-enabled microbattery packaging is demonstrated as an efficient 3D printing platform to integrate ZIMBs into wearable monoliths. Such remarkable electrochemical behaviors and wearable integration applications are attributed to advanced 3D printing techniques and sophisticated microelectrode design, paving future roads in manufacturing of state-of-the-art MI-ESSs and powering portable and wearable electronics. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","All-3d-printing; Microbattery; Solid-state; Wearable integration; Zn anode","3D printers; Integration; Ions; Microelectrodes; Photopolymerization; Wearable technology; Zinc; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; All-3d-printing; Integration design; Micro battery; Solid-state; Storage systems; Wearable integration; Zinc ions; Zn anode; Anodes","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12192213, 21975230, 21975230,12192213); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LY20B010001); Guangxi Key Research and Development Program, (2021BAA175)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 21975230 , 12192213 ), Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China ( LY20B010001 ), the Key Research and Development Program of Hubei ( 2021BAA175 ). ; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21975230,12192213), Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (LY20B010001), the Key Research and Development Program of Hubei (2021BAA175).","Sun K., Wei T.S., Ahn B.Y., Seo J.Y., Dillon S.J., Lewis J.A., 3D printing of interdigitated Li-ion microbattery architectures, Adv.

For PBF, the selection of appropriate process parameters, environmental control, and machine functions play critical roles in maintaining fabrication consistency and reducing potential part defects such as cracks and pores. However, poor data representations in the form of approximated geometry and incoherent process plans can negatively impact the relationship between the selected parameters. To address this issue, the Standard for the Exchange of Product model data Numerical Control (STEP-NC) recently added standardized data entities and attributes specifically for AM applications. Yet, the current STEP-NC data representations for AM do not have definitions for process parameters and scan strategies that are commonly used in PBF processes. Therefore, there is a need for defining data models that link process parameters with process control. To bridge this gap, in this paper, an amended STEP-NC compliant data representation for PBF in AM is proposed. Specifically, the characteristics of the interlayer relationships in PBF, along with the technology and scan strategy controls, are defined. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of granular process planning control and the potential for producing high-quality parts that meet geometric requirements and tight tolerances. The contributions of this paper highlight the importance of information models in AM, promoting data representations as key enablers of the AM technology and supporting the neutrality and interoperability of data across AM systems.

Despite significant advances in dental implants in the past two decades, it remains a major challenge to adapt bone grafts and barrier membrane in surgery due to the complicated anatomy of tooth and defect contours. Herein, we developed a novel biphasic hierarchical architecture with modularized functions and shape based on alveolar bone anatomy to achieve the ideal outcomes. Methods: The integrated hierarchical architecture comprising of nonstoichiometric wollastonite (nCSi) scaffolds and gelatin methacrylate/silanized hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (GelMA/Si-HPMC) hydrogel membrane was fabricated by digital light processing (DLP) and photo-crosslinked hydrogel injection technique respectively. The rheological parameters, mechanical properties and degradation rates of composite hydrogels were investigated. L-929 cells were cultured on the hydrogel samples to evaluate biocompatibility and cell barrier effect. Cell scratch assay, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, and alizarin red (AR) staining were used to reveal the migration and osteogenic ability of hydrogel membrane based on mouse mandible-derived osteoblasts (MOBs). Subsequently, a critical-size one-wall periodontal defect model in dogs was prepared to evaluate the periodontal tissue reconstruction potential of the biphasic hierarchical architecture. Results: The personalized hydrogel membrane integrating tightly with the nCSi scaffolds exhibited favorable cell viability and osteogenic ability in vitro, while the scratch assay showed that osteoblast migration was drastically correlated with Si-HPMC content in the composite hydrogel. The equivalent composite hydrogel has proven good physiochemical properties, and its membrane exhibited potent occlusive effect in vivo; meanwhile, the hierarchical architectures exerted a strong periodontal regeneration capability in the periodontal intrabony defect models of dogs. Histological examination showed effective bone and periodontal ligament regeneration in the biomimetic architecture system; however, soft tissue invasion was observed in the control group. Conclusions: Our results suggested that such modularized hierarchical architectures have excellent potential as a next-generation oral implants, and this precisely tuned guided tissue regeneration route offer an opportunity for improving periodontal damage reconstruction and reducing operation sensitivity. © 2022, The Author(s).","Bioactive scaffolds; Biphasic hierarchical architecture; Guided tissue regeneration; Hydrogel membrane; Modularized functions and structures","alizarin red s; alkaline phosphatase; bioceramics; calcium; calcium silicate; gelatin; hydrogel; hydroxypropylmethylcellulose; methacrylic acid; alveolar bone; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bone defect; bone development; bone volume fraction; compression; compressive strength; confocal microscopy; controlled study; cross linking; dog; elasticity; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; histology; in vitro study; male; mandible; mandibular first molar; micro-computed tomography; mouse; NCTC clone 929 cell line; nonhuman; osteoblast; particle size; periodontal ligament; periodontium; physical chemistry; polymerization; scanning electron microscopy; tissue regeneration; tooth cementum; Young modulus","","alizarin red s, 130-22-3, 83-61-4; alkaline phosphatase, 9001-78-9; calcium, 7440-70-2, 14092-94-5; calcium silicate, 1344-95-2, 13983-17-0; gelatin, 9000-70-8; hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, 9004-65-3; methacrylic acid, 18358-13-9, 79-41-4","Inveon, Siemens, Germany","Siemens, Germany","College of Agriculture and Biotechnology; Institute of Nuclear-Agricultural Science; Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province Foundation, (2019C03027); Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Education Department, (Y202148333); Zhejiang Provincial Basic Research for Public Welfare Funds, (LGF21H140001, LGF22E030002); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LZ22E020002); Zhejiang University, ZJU","Funding text 1: The sterilization of architectures in this work was supported by Zhiyang Yu from Accelerator Center of Zhejiang University, Institute of Nuclear-Agricultural Science, College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University. ; Funding text 2: This work was jointly supported by the Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province Foundation (2019C03027), Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (LZ22E020002), a Project Supported by Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Education Department (Y202148333), Zhejiang Provincial Basic Research for Public Welfare Funds (LGF22E030002, LGF21H140001).

The effects of melt pool boundaries on the ductility and fracture behavior of the LPBF-produced AlSi10Mg have not been systematically studied. The focus of this work is to investigate the local strain evolution, microvoid growth, and crack formation in the melt pool boundary regions using in situ tensile testing and synchrotron-based X-ray microtomography. Results indicate that decreasing area fractions of melt pool boundaries from 5.48% to 4.48% leads to an increase of tensile ductility from 7.2% to 9.8% in the LPBF AlSi10Mg samples. By influencing the density of melt pool boundaries in the LPBF process, while maintaining part density, we offer a new opportunity to fabricate AlSi10Mg products with an excellent combination of high strength and ductility. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; AlSi10Mg; Characterization; Ductility; Fracture","3D printers; Additives; Fracture; Fracture mechanics; Lakes; Tensile testing; Characterization; Ductility behaviors; Fracture behavior; High-strength; Laser powders; Local strains; Melt pool; Powder bed; Processing technologies; Tensile ductility; Ductility","","","","","Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering at the University of Toronto; Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario, (814654); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (RGPIN-2018-05731); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201906020162); China Scholarship Council, CSC","H.C. and Y.Z. acknowledge the financial support from Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC Discovery Grant # RGPIN-2018-05731 ) and the Dean's Spark Assistant Professorship in the Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering at the University of Toronto.

In this study, the in-situ laser shock peening method is employed for the first time to improve the surface quality and mechanical properties of L-DED-fabricated AlSi10Mg alloy. The physical mechanism of the compressive pressure on the pore defects is accounted for using the finite element method. The numerical results indicate that severe plastic deformation driven by the shock wave contributes to defect healing, and the maximum pressure plays a crucial role. The effects of surface laser shock peening (SLSP) and layer-by-layer laser shock peening (LLSP) on the densification, surface quality, including the roughness and residual stress, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the samples are experimentally studied. After the LLSP treatment, the surface quality and mechanical properties of the samples exceed those of common aluminium alloys fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF). After the SLSP treatment, a compressive residual stress with a maximum value of 30 ± 14 MPa is formed on the upper surface, and the LLSP treatment overcome the depth limitation of the affected zone. Furthermore, the LLSP treatment addresses the strength–ductility trade-off, and realizes an excellent combination of strength and ductility through grain refinement, dislocation strengthening, and compressive residual stress. Therefore, this work establishes the viability of in-situ laser shock peening for the rapid additive manufacturing of large-size aluminium alloys.

This paper investigates 3D-printed bio-inspired spherical-roof cubic cores with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and foam-filled cores under quasi-static loading. The proposed bio-inspired spherical-roof cubic cores with 1.5 mm wall thickness were manufactured using the fused filament fabrication process, which used 70% polylactic acid (PLA) and 30% carbon fiber filament. Moreover, four groups of 3D-printed bio-inspired spherical-roof cubic cores were compared and analyzed on compressive properties and failure behavior. Experimental results were shown that foam-filled double bio-inspired spherical-roof cubic core with MWCNT was the maximum Fpeak with 1.92 kN, which provided a much more stable plateau load and better energy-absorbing characteristics. In addition, it is conducted that a double bio-inspired spherical-roof cubic core with four notches core is considered as the potential energy-absorbing core. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3D-printed core; Bio-inspired spherical-roof cubic core; MWCNT; Quasi-static loading; Three-dimensional periodic core","Carbon Fiber; Cytoskeleton; Food; Nanotubes, Carbon; Printing, Three-Dimensional; 3D printers; Biomimetics; Carbon fibers; Crashworthiness; Energy absorption; Foams; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Roofs; Spheres; carbon fiber; multi walled nanotube; polylactic acid; carbon nanotube; 3d-printed core; Bio-inspired spherical-roof cubic core; Energy; Foam filled; Multi-walled-carbon-nanotubes; Periodic cores; Quasi-static loading; Sandwich panel; Spherical roofs; Three-dimensional periodic core; Article; compressive strength; fused deposition modeling; thickness; three dimensional printing; cytoskeleton; food; three dimensional printing; Potential energy","","polylactic acid, 26100-51-6; Carbon Fiber, ; Nanotubes, Carbon, ","","","Faculty of Mechanical & Automotive Engineering Technology, Universiti Malaysia Pahang, (RDU1901126); Focus Group, Universiti Malaysia Pahang; Makers Lab and the Structural Performance Materials Engineering; SUPREME; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/2019/TK03/UMP/02/10)","The authors would like to acknowledge the Ministry of Education Malaysia : FRGS/1/2019/TK03/UMP/02/10 , and the Faculty of Mechanical & Automotive Engineering Technology, Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP) : RDU1901126 for funding this research.

Vat-photopolymerization additive technology has good process capability and produces high-quality photopolymer parts with greater geometrical complexity. This paper proposes the vat-photopolymerization process to fabricate high-strength acrylate-based photopolymer composite with improved mechanical strength. The composite structures contain 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 wt percentages of 13 nm average-sized alumina (Al2O3) nanoparticle (NP) as the reinforcement and acrylate photopolymer as matrix material. The viscosities of all the prepared suspensions were measured to determine the printing properties of the prepared nanocomposites, and these values are within the feasible printing limit. Furthermore, the depth of cure and time of exposure to UV light were optimized to achieve the desired level of printing performance. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the alumina nanocomposites reveals that the addition of alumina NP has minimal influence on the thermal stability of the photopolymer matrix. To ascertain the mechanical strength of the 3D printed products, tensile tests are performed, and it was witnessed that 1.0% weight fraction of alumina-NP loaded specimen experienced the highest tensile strength amongst all the weight fractions of alumina-NP considered, and its value increased by ∼48% when compared against the pure acrylate polymer sample. The increase in strength values for the alumina-NP loaded specimen was explained using dynamic mechanical analysis and optical and scanning electron micrographs. A constitutive elastic-viscoplastic isothermal non-linear time-dependent material model is also developed to predict the post-yield strain-softening behavior of these nanocomposites. The weight fraction and optimal weight fraction of alumina nanoparticles are correlated using semi-empirical equations of various model parameters. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D printed nanocomposite; Additive manufacturing; Alumina nanoparticle; Elastic-viscoplastic constitutive model; Mechanical deformation; Vat-photopolymerization","3D printers; Additives; Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Deformation; Fabrication; Nanoparticles; Photopolymerization; Printing properties; Scanning electron microscopy; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Thermodynamic stability; Thermogravimetric analysis; 3d printed nanocomposite; Additive technology; Alumina Nanoparticle; Elastic viscoplastic constitutive model; Mechanical; Mechanical deformation; Parameter optimization; Photo polymerization; Vat-photopolymerization; Weight fractions; Nanocomposites","","","","","DST FIST, (SR/FST/ET–II/2018/222); Fluid Surface Interaction Laboratory; Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Alberta","The author(s) acknowledge DST FIST (SR/FST/ET–II/2018/222(C)), Fluid Surface Interaction Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT (ISM), Dhanbad, India for sharing research equipment facility.","Raj R., Vamsi Venkata Krishna S., Desai A., Sachin C., Dixit A.R., Print fidelity evaluation of PVA hydrogel using computational fluid dynamics for extrusion dependent 3D printing, IOP Conf.

This technical note reports on the design and construction of a 3D-printed mouthpiece adapter for sampling exhaled breath using the commercial respiration collector for in-vitro analysis (ReCIVA) device. The paper presents the design and digital workflow transition of the adapter and its fabrication from three commercial resins (Surgical Guide, Tough v5, and BioMed Clear) using a Formlabs Form 3B stereolithography (SLA) printer. The use of the mouthpiece adapter in conjunction with a pulmonary function filter is appraised in comparison to the conventional commercial silicon facemask sampling interface. Besides its lower cost – investment cost of the printing equipment notwithstanding – the 3D-printed adapter has several benefits, including ensuring breath sampling via the mouth, reducing the likelihood of direct contact of the patient with the breath sampling tubes, and being autoclaveable to enable the repeated use of a single adapter, thereby reducing waste and associated environmental burden compared to current one-way disposable facemasks. The novel adapter for breath sampling presented in this technical note represents an additional field of application for 3D printing that further demonstrates its widespread applicability in biomedicine. © 2022, The Author(s).","Breath Analysis;

Here we design and experimentally achieve an ultralight framework of lattice-truss-core sandwich panels, namely meta-lattice structure, for highly-efficient, broadband low-frequency vibration attenuation. A composite meta-lattice sandwich panel is proposed and integrally fabricated with glass fiber reinforced Nylon by the 3D printing technique of selective laser sintering. Requiring neither heavy local-resonators nor soft damping support, the designed meta-lattice structure can generate a wide low-frequency bandgap, where the bandwidth has a remarkable double-time increment, meanwhile the yield strength has a significant improvement. An analytical model based on Rayleigh-energy and Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is presented to tailor the bandgap characteristics. Without losing lightweight superiority, our meta-lattice prototype exhibits absolute advantages in broadband, low-frequency vibration attenuation and high loading-bearing capacity, which offers a thriving avenue to the outstanding integration of structural strength and diverse-function performance. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","A.
