The results indicate that both the microstructure of as-deposited and annealed alloys consists of phases Ti3Al (α2) and TiAl (γ). When the annealing temperature was increased, the microstructure changed significantly and a greater amount of lamellar α2 phase precipitated between the lamellae. Meanwhile, the thickness of γ lamellar at the edges of lamellar clusters increased. In comparison with the annealed alloy, the secondary annealed alloy demonstrated a significant coarsening of the lamellar γ phase. Increasing the annealing temperature gradually increased the texture strength of the γ (1 1 1) orientation. At room temperature and high temperature, the as-deposited alloy had a higher tensile strength than the annealed alloy. Ti-48Al-2Cr-5Nb alloy samples secondary annealed at 1260 °C/1h/FC exhibited the highest elongations at room temperature, 750 °C, and 850 °C, with values of 1.6%, 3.8%, and 4.8%, respectively. As compared to the as-deposited alloy, the elongation increased by 1.15, 1.36, and 1.07 times, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Annealing treatment; Laser additive manufacturing (LAM); Microstructure; Tensile properties; Ti-48Al-2Cr-5Nb alloy","3D printers; Additives; Annealing; Binary alloys; Chromium alloys; Coarsening; Fabrication; Niobium alloys; Tensile strength; Textures; Titanium alloys; Annealed alloys; Annealing temperatures; Annealing treatments; As-deposited alloy; Coarsenings; Effect of annealing; Laser additive manufacturing; Texture strength; Ti-48al-2cr-5nb alloy; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Dalian University of Technology, DUT, (XB2021005)","This work was supported by PhD research startup foundation of Liaoning University of Technology ( XB2021005 ).","Qu H.P., Li P., Zhang S.Q., Li A., Wang H.M., The effects of heat treatment on the microstructure and mechanical property of laser melting deposition γ-TiAl intermetallic alloys, Mater.

In this work, we propose a modeling method for triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) lattice structures with complex contours. This method is based on moving elements method (MEM) and mainly includes the following parts: dividing the model mesh, solving the iso-surface of the TPMS in the model, obtaining the TPMS lattice structure triangular surface of the model outline, integrating the interior of the model and the outline, and finally generating an STL file that can be used for additive manufacturing. Furthermore, the representative femur model, rabbit model, and gear model are provided as case studies to verify the validity and correctness of the proposed modeling method. Then, this approach is compared with the distance field-based method (DFBM) in terms of modeling speed and modeling accuracy. The research results show that the time required by the MEM method was reduced by 3055.56%, 2799.70% compared to the DFBM method, when filling the network primitive and network gyroid lattice structures in the femur model. Moreover, this method provides technical means and simulation data for designing TPMS lattice structures with complex contour, and offers the underlying design ideas for the development and application of the excellent physical properties of TPMS lattice structures in medicine and engineering. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Complex contour; Modeling method; Moving elements method; TPMS lattice structure","Complex contour; Design method; Distance field; Lattice structures; Model method; Moving element method; Novel design; Surface lattice; Triply periodic minimal surface lattice structure; Triply periodic minimal surfaces; Complex networks","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing, (cstc2020jcyj-zdxmX0021, cstc2021jcyj-msxmX0395); Natural Science Foundation Project of Chongqing, Chongqing Science and Technology Commission","This work was supported by the Key projects of Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing (cstc2020jcyj-zdxmX0021) and the Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing (cstc2021jcyj-msxmX0395).

The forces on the cochlea during the insertion can lead to this mechanical trauma but can be highly variable between subjects which is thought to be due to differing anatomy, namely of the scala tympani. This study presents a systematic investigation of the influence of different geometrical parameters of the scala tympani on the cochlear implant insertion force. The influence of these parameters on the insertion forces were determined by testing the forces within 3D-printed, optically transparent models of the scala tympani with geometric alterations. (2) Methods: Three-dimensional segmentations of the cochlea were characterised using a custom MATLAB script which parametrised the scala tympani model, procedurally altered the key shape parameters (e.g., the volume, vertical trajectory, curvature, and cross-sectional area), and generated 3D printable models that were printed using a digital light processing 3D printer. The printed models were then attached to a custom insertion setup that measured the insertion forces on the cochlear implant and the scala tympani model during a controlled robotic insertion. (3) Results: It was determined that the insertion force is largely unaffected by the overall size, curvature, vertical trajectory, and cross-sectional area once the forces were normalised to an angular insertion depth. A Capstan-based model of the CI insertion forces was developed and matched well to the data acquired. (4) Conclusion: By using accurate 3D-printed models of the scala tympani with geometrical alterations, it was possible to demonstrate the insensitivity of the insertion forces to the size and shape of the scala tympani, after controlling for the angular insertion depth. This supports the Capstan model of the cochlear implant insertion force which predicts an exponential growth of the frictional force with an angular insertion depth. This concludes that the angular insertion depth, rather than the length of the CI inserted, should be the major consideration when evaluating the insertion force and associated mechanical trauma caused by cochlear implant insertion. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing; cochlear implant; insertion forces; micro-CT; scala tympani","Cochlea; Cochlear Implantation; Cochlear Implants; Humans; Mechanical Phenomena; Scala Tympani; 3D printing; Audition; Computerized tomography; Geometry; poloxamer; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Cross sectional area; Hearing loss; Insertion depth; Insertion force; Mechanical; Micro CT; Residual hearing; Scala tympani; angular insertion depth; Article; auditory system parameters; Capstan model; cochlear implantation; cochlear size; human; image processing; image segmentation; insertion force; micro-computed tomography; microfluidics; model; physical parameters; scala tympani; scala tympani geometry; stereolithography; three dimensional printing; volumetry; anatomy and histology; cochlea; cochlea prosthesis; mechanics; procedures; scala tympani; surgery; Cochlear implants","","poloxamer, 9003-11-6","XT 225 ST, Nikon","Nikon","Anatomical Society, AS; ; Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI; Wellcome Trust Developing Concept Fund, (RG93172/BANCE/40181, G100138); Rosetrees Trust, (EF2020\100099, F112)","This research was supported by the Wellcome Trust Developing Concept Fund (RG93172/BANCE/40181).

Therefore, commercially available drill bits which typically reflect two extremes of drill bit quality were selected. The performance of coated carbide twist drills, typically recommended for the drilling of wrought titanium alloys was compared with that of high-speed steel (HSS) drills. The average torque value, specific cutting energy (SCE), and tool wear were used to evaluate the drilling performance of AM and PM titanium alloys. The results of drilling tests revealed the application of the coated carbide drill resulted in lower torque and SCE values, less flank wear, and lower build-up-edge (BUE) compared with the uncoated HSS drill bits for AM fabricated titanium alloys. However, the carbide drill appeared to offer negligible improvement over the uncoated HSS drill when employed with the PM fabricated titanium alloy. In spite of the improvement in the drilling performance offered by the carbide drills for the AM titanium alloy, TiB intermetallic particles (part of the AM titanium microstructure) contributed to the damage of the coated carbide drill which would limit the drill lifetime. © IMechE 2022.","Additive manufacturing; carbide; drilling; powder metallurgy; titanium alloy","3D printers; Additives; Bits; Carbides; Drills; Infill drilling; Powder metallurgy; Tool steel; Wear of materials; Average torques; Coated carbide drills; Coated carbides; Drilling performance; Machining behaviors; Performance; Specific cutting energy; Titanium (alloys); Twist drills; Titanium alloys","","","","","; University of Windsor","The authors would like to gratefully acknowledge Mrs. Sharon Lackie of the Great Lakes Institute for Environmental Research (GLIER), University of Windsor, Windsor, ON, for their assistance with the SEM micrographs.

Implementation of structural health monitoring (SHM) methods to these parts would let them gain continuous sensing and damage identification capability. The small size and very strong vibration damping characteristics of additively manufactured polymer parts do not allow the direct use of many SHM methods. In this study, detection and location estimation of compressive force applied to an additively manufactured part made of PLA was examined. The test specimen was designed with multiple skin thicknesses in each of the five zones and completely digital excitation was implemented on the part. Surface Response to the Excitation (SuRE) method was used in this study. Two piezoelectric elements were used for exciting the specimen with lamb waves from one side and recording the dynamic response to excitation at the other end of the part. The digital excitation included multiple pulses with different widths covering a wide range of exciting frequencies. Two different methods were used for damage localization, Deep Learning (DL) and the two-dimensional sum of the squares of differences (2DSSD). Short-time Fourier Transformation (STFT) was used to convert the experimental time-domain sensory data into the time–frequency domain (spectrograms). Two-dimensional images of the spectrograms were classified using 2DSSD and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNN could estimate the compressive force application zone with better than 97% accuracy. © 2022, Krishtel eMaging Solutions Private Limited.","Additive manufacturing; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning;

Our approach is based on Delaunay Lofts, a class of topologically interlocked shapes that are generated by stacking layers of Voronoi partitions of a set of moving Voronoi sites based on wallpaper symmetries. Our approach is based on two key insights. First, each layer of a Delaunay Loft is simply a tessellation of convex polygons allowing for easy division of cells for collision-free simultaneous material deposition. Second, the unique transition of Voronoi cells along the layers naturally leads to topological interlocking, thereby providing better energy absorption ability compensating for the loss of structural strength due to segmented printing. In this work, we constrain our current investigation to a two-robot system and develop the LayerLock algorithm consisting of three steps: (1) a distance-based division of the Voronoi cells at each layer of the Delaunay Loft, (2) a moving-front strategy for determining the sequence of cells for each robot, and (3) print path generation based on the cell sequence, which allows synchronous collaboration. We evaluate our algorithm for a range of geometric parameters such as part orientation and cell resolution. We also demonstrate it practically using a two-robot cooperative 3D printing platform. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3D printing; Cooperative manufacturing; Path planning; Topological interlocking; Voronoi decomposition","Additives; Cells; Cytology; Industrial robots; Motion planning; Multipurpose robots; Robot programming; Topology; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Collision-free; Cooperative manufacturing; Delaunay; Layer-wise; Multirobots; Topological interlocking; Voronoi cell; Voronoi decomposition; 3D printers","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2112009, 2048182)","This work was partially supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), USA Awards #2048182 (Engineering Design and Systems Engineering Program) and #2112009 (Small Business Innovation Research Program).

In this work, a novel 95 W heavy alloy modified by nanosized Ni and Fe particles was manufactured by LDED process. The effects of laser power on the formation mechanisms of molten pool were investigated. It was found that a relatively high laser power could promote the complete melting of W powder and formation of regular molten pool morphology. The microstructures of laser-processed W heavy alloy showed columnar grains, cellular grains and equiaxed grains from bottom to top within the molten pool along the building direction. The three-dimensional finite element simulation revealed the temperature gradient (G), cooling rate (C) and solidification velocity (S) within the molten pool were different, which was responsible for the microstructural development. The bulk-form 95 W heavy-alloy part free of defects was produced at the laser power of 1400 W. The optimally processed 95 W heavy-alloy by LDED showed a high average nanohardness of 8.6 GPa and a sound wear performance with a low coefficient of friction (COF) of 0.5. The tensile tests also revealed the achievement of a combination of an excellent tensile strength of 541 MPa and an elongation of 0.99%. This work demonstrated that LDED was able to manufacture high-performance tungsten heavy-alloys in bulk form with outstanding mechanical properties. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Laser directed energy deposition; Mechanical properties; Microstructure evolution; Molten pool formation; Tungsten heavy-alloy","Deposition; Morphology; Temperature; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Textures; Tungsten alloys; Directed energy; Energy depositions; Heavy alloy; Laser directed energy deposition; Microstructure evolutions; Molten pool; Molten pool formation; Performance; Pool formation; Tungsten heavy alloys; Friction","","","","","Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province, (KYCX20_0193); Six Talents Peaks” Innovative Talents Team Program, (TD-GDZB-001); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51921003); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (NC2020004); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, PAPD; Science Challenge Project, (2019-JCJQ-JJ-331, TZ2018006-0301-02, TZ2018006-0303-03)","This work was supported by the Science Challenge Project (No. TZ2018006-0301-02 and No. TZ2018006-0303-03 ); the Basic Strengthening Program (No. 2019-JCJQ-JJ-331 ); National Natural Science Foundation of China for Creative Research Groups (Grant No. 51921003 ); The 15th Batch of “Six Talents Peaks” Innovative Talents Team Program (No. TD-GDZB-001 ); the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (NO.

For the first time, we prove that the configuration of a printout made of resin material can be modified for effective permittivity variation and apply the technique to a lens antenna design. The lens is printed with SLA printing and mounted on top of a conventional patch antenna, resulting in a 6.87 dB directivity improvement. The height of the proposed lens is reduced by about 15% compared to the reference lens design. The final proposed lens antenna operates at 5.8 GHz, with a height and diameter of 1.35 (Formula presented.) and 1.35 (Formula presented.), respectively.

The entire pelma (EP) was divided into three partitions: posterior heel (HP), lateral side of the sole (SL) and medial side of the sole (SM) according to the three-point support mechanics mechanism of the foot and ankle. A distributed force platform was established to obtain the mean positions of the center of pressure (CoP) trajectories on SL, SM, HP, and EP, which were defined as A, B, C, and O, respectively. Based on the principle that the arch height influences the distance from point O to the boundary of triangle ABC, the area ratio of triangle BOC to triangle ABC was defined as FAI. Arch height index (AHI) measurement of thirty participants by combined calipers was compared with FAI measurement of their right feet. The arches were classified based on AHI, and ANOVA was performed. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the FAI method and the AHI method is 0.79 (p＜0.0001). The Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement. ANOVA indicated FAI was statistically significant (F = 18.81,p＜0.001), and there were statistical differences between groups. These results suggest that the proposed distributed force measurement method can provide support surface boundary (triangle ABC) information related to point O. © 2022","Arch index; Distributed force; FAI; Force platform; Support surface","Foot; Humans; Arches; Correlation methods; Force measurement; Arch height indices; Arch index; Distributed forces; Foot arch index; Foot arches; Force platform; Index measurements; Measurement methods; Measurements of; Support surfaces; adult; analysis of variance; analytic method; ankle; anthropometric parameters; arch height index; arch index measurement method; Article; biomechanics; controlled study; correlation coefficient; force; heel; height; human; human experiment; normal human; plantar distributed force; pressure measurement; statistical analysis; statistical significance; surface property; foot; Analysis of variance (ANOVA)","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52105017, U1713210); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province, (2108085QE222); Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province","This research was supported by the: (1) National Natural Science Foundation(U1713210), (2) National Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. 52105017), (3) Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. 2108085QE222).

This work demonstrates masked stereolithography (mSLA) of biopolymer-based nanocomposites and the improvement of their mechanical properties by the functionalization of both polymer matrix and nanoparticles with methacrylate groups. 3D printable nanocomposite inks were prepared from plant-derived acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO), polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), and nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA). Both AESO and nHA were further functionalized with additional methacrylate groups. We hypothesized that the additional functionalization of AESO and surface functionalization of nHA would improve the tensile strength and fracture toughness of these nanocomposites by increasing the degree of crosslinking and the strength of the interface between the matrix and nanoparticles. Curing efficiency, rheology, and print-fidelity of the nanocomposites were evaluated. Mechanical test specimens were prepared by mSLA-based 3D printing. Tensile mechanical properties, Poisson's ratio, and Mode-I fracture toughness were measured by following ASTM standards. Fracture surfaces of the tested specimens were studied using scanning electron microscopy. Thermomechanical behavior, especially glass transition temperature (Tg), was studied using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Functionalized AESO (mAESO) improved rheological, tensile, and fracture mechanical properties. For instance, by replacing AESO with mAESO, tensile strength, Young's modulus, fracture toughness (K1c), and Tg increased by 33%, 53%, 40%, and 38% respectively. In addition, the combination of both functionalized nHA and mAESO improved the fracture toughness of the 10% volume fraction nHA nanocomposites but made them less extensible presumably due to reduced chain mobility due to greater crosslinking. © 2022","3D printing; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Fracture toughness; Masked stereolithography; Nanocomposites; Nanohydroxyapatite; Surface functionalization; Tensile strength","Biopolymers; Methacrylates; Nanocomposites; Polyethylene Glycols; Polymers; Stereolithography; 3D printers; ASTM standards; Biomolecules; Biopolymers; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Dynamics; Elastic moduli; Fracture toughness; Glass transition; Nanoparticles; Polymer matrix composites; Scanning electron microscopy; Soybean oil; Tensile strength; biopolymer; macrogol; methacrylic acid; nanocomposite; nanohydroxyapatite; soybean oil; biopolymer; polymer; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Acrylated epoxidized soybean oil; Functionalizations; Functionalized; Masked stereolithography; Methacrylate groups; Nano-hydroxyapatite; Surface Functionalization; Tensile mechanical properties; Article; breaking strength; chemical modification; cross linking; drug combination; epoxidation; flow kinetics; glass transition temperature; mechanical test; mechanics; scanning electron microscopy; stereolithography; surface property; tensile strength; three dimensional printing; viscosity; Young modulus; Nanocomposites","","macrogol, 25322-68-3; methacrylic acid, 18358-13-9, 79-41-4; soybean oil, 8001-22-7; Biopolymers, ; Methacrylates, ; Polyethylene Glycols, ; Polymers, ","","","Ontario Research Foundation, ORF; Canadian Institutes of Health Research, IRSC; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Canada Foundation for Innovation, CFI","This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada , the Canadian Institutes of Health Research , the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, and the Ontario Research Fund.

They can also act as a template to culture reseeded cells in vitro. However, detergent-based decellularization methods are known to alter the biochemical compositions, thereby compromising the bioactive potential of dECM. This study proposes a facile detergent-free method to achieve dECM from smooth muscle tissue. We have used the muscle layer of caprine esophageal tissue and decellularized using hypo and hyper-molar sodium chloride solutions alternatingly. Then, a hydrogel was prepared from this decellularized smooth muscle matrix (dSMM) and characterized thoroughly. A comparative analysis of the dSMM prepared with our protocol with the existing detergent-based protocol suggests successful and comparable decellularization with minimal residual DNA content. Interestingly, an 8.78-fold increase in sulfated glycosaminoglycans content and 1.62-fold increased collagen content indicated higher retention of ECM constituents with NaCl-based decellularization strategy. Moreover, the dSMM gel induces differentiation of the encapsulated adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells toward smooth muscle cells (SMCs) as observed by their expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, the hallmarks of SMCs. Finally, we optimized the process parameter for productive bioprinting with this dSMM bioink and fabricated 3D muscle constructs. Our results suggest that dSMM has the potential to be used as a bioink to engineer personalized esophageal tissues. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","3D bioprinting; decellularized smooth muscle matrix; esophagus; hypo/hyper NaCl; stem cell differentiation","Cell culture; Hydrogels; Muscle; Proteins; Stem cells; alpha smooth muscle actin; collagen; detergent; glycosaminoglycan polysulfate; hydrogel; ink; myosin heavy chain; sodium chloride; 3d bioprinting; Bioprinting; Decellularized; Decellularized smooth muscle matrix; Esophagus; Extracellular matrices; Hypo/hyper nacl; matrix; Smooth muscles; Stem cell differentiation; adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell; animal tissue; Article; cell differentiation; cell encapsulation; cell viability; compression; controlled study; decellularization; decellularized extracellular matrix; DNA content; esophagus tissue; flow kinetics; goat; heavy chain; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; muscle development; nonhuman; protein expression; smooth muscle cell; three dimensional bioprinting; Sodium chloride","","collagen, 9007-34-5; glycosaminoglycan polysulfate, 63449-40-1; sodium chloride, 7647-14-5, 23724-87-0, 49658-21-1","","","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी, (SR/FST/LSI-683/2016); Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Govt. of India under the FIST program (SR/FST/LSI-683/2016(C)).; Funding text 2: The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Govt. of India under the FIST program (SR/FST/LSI‐683/2016(C)).

The application of inter-pass machine hammer peening—where each added layer was deformed before deposition—successfully refined the strongly textured, coarse, columnar β-grain structure that is commonly seen in α + β titanium alloys, producing a finer equiaxed grain structure with a near-random α texture. The average grain diameter and texture strength decreased with the peening pitch. When Ti6242 was deposited under identical conditions to Ti64, by switching the alloy feed wire in-situ, the refined β-grain size decreased across the alloy-to-alloy transition reaching on average 25 pct less in Ti6242 than in Ti64. A similar 25 pct scale reduction was also found in the Ti6242 α-lath transformation microstructure. This comparatively greater microstructure refinement in Ti6242 was attributed to the dissimilar alloying elements present in the two materials; specifically, molybdenum, which has a lower diffusivity than vanadium and led to slower β-grain growth during reheating as well as a finer transformation microstructure. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Additives; Alloying elements; Deposition; Grain growth; Grain refinement; Hammers; Textures; Titanium alloys; Wire; Alloy Ti; Deposition process; Directed energy; Energy depositions; Machine hammer peening; Microstructure refinement; Ti-6Al-2Sn-4Zr-2Mo; Ti-6al-4v; Titanium alloy (Ti); Wire arc; Grain size and shape","","","","","Airbus-University of Manchester Centre for Metallurgical Excellence; Royal Academy of Engineering, UK, and Airbus; Henry Royce Institute, (EP/P025021/1, EP/P025498/1, EP/R00661X/1, EP/S019367/1); Henry Royce Institute; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/R001715/1, EP/R027218/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC","The authors are appreciative of the EPSRC programme grants NEWAM (EP/R027218/1) and LightForm (EP/R001715/1) for supporting aspects of this research.

The IB is composed of two parallel blades joined at their tips and roots, forming a distinctive hole in the space between the blades that generates a Venturi effect as air passes through. This phenomenon in the IB hole together with the extra lift generated by the area of the second blade produce extra valuable torque during the starting phase. We used Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis to evaluate the aerodynamic properties of this design compared with a traditional blade design of the same radius. The IB and traditional prototypes were built (50W, diameter 0.62m, λ=9 and at speed rated 8m/s) by additive manufacturing in a 3D printer and their aerodynamic behaviors tested in a small wind tunnel (square section 0.7m x 0.7m). Our results using CFD analysis show that this novel IB produces up to 65% extra torque without losing output power for low wind velocity (5-8 m/s).

For corroboration, a frequency selective surface (FSS) with meandered square loop and a monopole antenna are manufactured using AM and printed circuit board (PCB) technologies. The performance of these prototypes designed for sub-6 GHz applications are comparatively analyzed. A parametric study further explicates the high design flexibility supported by AM. The proposed FSS has a unit cell dimension of 0.15λ0 × 0.15λ0 × 0.02λ0, where λ0 stands for free space wavelength at the lower cut-off frequency. It works as a reflector in the frequency range of 2.96–4.17 GHz. The gain of the monopole antenna manufactured with the same technology is improved using the proposed FSS. The average gain is increased by 3 dBi over the operational frequency range. The proposed FSS was verified with a circuit model and also analyzed for conformal conditions. The measured values of all the AM and PCB prototypes shows good concordance with the simulated response. The results support the positive impact of the rapidly progressing AM technology in future RF prototyping. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","additive manufacturing; conformal; frequency selective surface; printed monopole antenna","Additives; Equivalent circuits; Frequency selective surfaces; Microstrip antennas; Microwave antennas; Monopole antennas; Printed circuit boards; Additive manufacturing technology; Conformal; Frequency-selective surfaces; Gain enhancement; Microwave components; Parametric study; Performance; Printed circuit board technology; Printed monopole antennas; Square loop; 3D printers","","","","","","","Ian Gibson I.G., Additive Manufacturing Technologies 3D Printing, Rapid Prototyping, and Direct Digital Manufacturing, (2015); Zhang S., Cadman D., Vardaxoglou J.Y.C., Additively manufactured profiled conical horn antenna with dielectric loading, IEEE Antennas Wirel Propag Lett, 17, 11, pp. 2128-2132, (2018); Wahyud A.H., Sumantyo J.T.S., Budiyanta A.S., Munir A., 3D printed wideband circularly polarized pyramidal horn antenna.

The addition of Ta significantly increased the phase transformation temperatures, leading to a room-temperature microstructure composed of both B19′ martensite and B2 austenite, and (Ti,Ta)2Ni precipitates distributed at the grain boundaries. Compared with the WAAM fabricated NiTi counterpart, the corrosion potential (Ecorr) of the NiTiTa material increased from − 0.55 to − 0.44 V, while the corrosion current density (Icorr) decreased from 1.90 × 10−6 to 4.2 × 10−7 A/cm2. The X-ray brightness increased from 19.6 to 56.4 %. These results indicate that the addition of Ta can enhance the corrosion resistance and X-ray visibility of NiTiTa parts. Furthermore, the WAAM fabricated NiTiTa material was able to retain a stable superelastic response under 10 loading-unloading cycles, highlighting the great potential application value in the biomedical field.

While cellular automata (CA)-based models have proven able to predict aspects of microstructure for several alloys and AM process conditions, long run times and large resource sets required limit the utility and the problem size to which existing CA models can be applied. As part of the ExaAM project, an initiative within the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) to develop, test, and optimize an exascale-capable coupled and self-consistent model of AM parts, we developed ExaCA (https://github.com/LLNL/ExaCA) for the liquid–solid phase transformation in the wake of AM melt pools. The CA-based code is parallelized using MPI and the Kokkos programming model, the latter enabling simulation on both CPUs and GPUs within a single-source implementation. We detail the steps taken to transform a baseline, MPI-based CA code into one that is performant on CPUs and GPUs. Performance testing of ExaCA on Summit (a pre-exascale machine at Oak Ridge National Laboratory) was used to quantify CPU–GPU speedup comparing with equal numbers of nodes. Testing showed comparable CPU performance to the MPI-only CA code and a 5-20x speedup when running AM-based test problems using GPUs. The improved performance of CA through GPU utilization and the performance portable nature of ExaCA will enable accurate part-scale modeling by harnessing the power of current and future generations of high performance computing resources. Future work will include improving the strong scaling of ExaCA on GPUs by reducing load imbalance associated with the locality of the problem, and continuing performance optimization across exascale hardware. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Alloy solidification; Cellular automata; High performance computing","3D printers; Additives; Cellular manufacturing; Grain size and shape; Graphics processing unit; Program processors; Solidification; Alloy solidification; Cellular automatons; Critical component; Exascale; High performance computing; Performance; Performance computing; Process properties; Processing condition; Solidification modeling; Cellular automata","","","","","DOE Public Access Plan; United States Government; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-AC05-00OR22725); Office of Science, SC; National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, LLNL, (17-SC-20-SC, DE-AC52-07NA27344)","Funding text 1: This manuscript has been authored by UT-Battelle, LLC under Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy.

In recent years, many studies have been carried out on WAAM, most of which have investigated the properties of the manufactured parts. Among these properties, the topic of fatigue was less frequently examined. The reasons for this may include difficulties such as the long duration of fatigue tests and the large number of test specimens required. However, since fatigue is responsible for most of the damage in metal components, it is important to determine the fatigue strength of the parts produced using WAAM. In this study, the WAAM process was applied to low alloy ER70S-6 steel, which is widely used in the metal industry and is also one of the most common materials used in WAAM processes. After the fabrication, horizontal and vertical specimens were obtained from the manufactured part and mechanical and metallurgical tests were applied, including, fatigue tests, with the fatigue properties of the produced WAAMed part determined using a specially designed and produced bending stress fatigue testing machine. Results demonstrated that the fatigue limits of the horizontal and vertical fatigue specimens at 107 cycles were very close to each other, as approximately 180 MPa. The fatigue strength values of the vertical and horizontal specimens were quite similar. However, the fatigue strength of the vertical specimens up to 106 cycles was found to be slightly higher. © 2022 Karabuk University","ER70S-6; Fatigue; Low carbon steel; Tensile test; WAAM","","","","","","Karabük University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit, (FDK-2019-2130); Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu, TÜBİTAK, (219M111)","This work was supported by Karabük University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit (Project number: FDK-2019-2130) and The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (Project number: 219M111).

The following parameters were calculated in the paper: theoretical gas flow speed to produce particles of required size by gas atomization of superheated fluid metal; specific flow rate of the metal flowing out of the metal tundish, and atomization nozzle parameters (such as critical and outlet cross-sectional areas and their ratio). Gas dynamics methods, being widespread in aviation engineering, were used to calculate the nozzle. The supersonic Laval nozzle parameters and gas dynamic parameters for atomization of the molten 10R6M5 tool steel were calculated at gauge gas pressures ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 MPa, allowing fine powders to be produced, including those with a particle size smaller than 50 μm. Graphical dependences were plotted to illustrate the theoretical speed at which particles of required size formed and the gas speed calculated as a function of the gas pressure before the atomization nozzle. A graphical method for determining the cross-sectional areas of the Laval nozzle and the inert gas flow speed for a given gauge pressure in the studied range was proposed. The following parameters for the production of 10R6M5 tool steel powders with a particle size smaller than 50 μm by gas atomization were established: gas flow speed at the nozzle outlet of 525 m/sec, temperature of –140°C, and pressure higher than 16.8 MPa. The calculated critical and outlet cross-sectional areas of the Laval nozzle were 110 and 290 mm2 and their ratio was 0.379. © 2023, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","10R6M5 tool steel; gas atomization conditions; gas dynamics methods; inert gas; Laval nozzle; particle size; powders; theoretical calculation","Atomization; Flow of gases; Gages; Gas dynamics; Geometry; Inert gases; Powder metallurgy; Powder metals; Tool steel; 10r6m5 tool steel; Condition; Cross sectional area; Flow speed; Gas atomization; Gas atomization condition; Gas-dynamic method; Laval nozzles; Particles sizes; Theoretical calculations; Particle size","","","","","","","Gogaev K.O., Ulshin V.I., Powder Metallurgy of Tool Steels [in Russian], Knowledge (Donetsk Branch), Donetsk, (2012); Radchenko O.K., Gogaev K.O., Requirements for metal and alloy powders for 3D printing (review), Powder Metall.

However, the concentration of adjacent tool-path fragments makes the thermo-mechanical properties of continuous tool-paths tend to be poor, resulting in performance degradation and other defects. This work focuses on the efficient planning of the continuous tool-path with fine thermo-mechanical properties and proposes an evolutional method based on genetic algorithm. All the key operations of the proposed method, such as crossover and mutation, are designed based on the characteristics of the research object. Thereinto, the fitness of a continuous tool-path is evaluated within several seconds by using the rapid thermo-mechanical field prediction model, which ensures the efficiency of the whole planning process. Additionally, the formability constraint is introduced to ensure the forming quality of the part fabricated with the planned tool-path. The experiments demonstrated that the thermo-mechanical properties of the planned tool-path improves by more than 87 % and the average residual Von Mises stresses of it decreases by more than 32 MPa. Meanwhile, the time cost of a single planning process is at the hour level, which is acceptable when considering that it takes several hours for the numerical simulation method to calculate one thermo-mechanical field. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Thermo-mechanical properties;

Due to the adherent growth characteristic of most mammalian cell types, the combination of cell carrier and bioreactor is a common choice in large-scale mammalian cell culture. Current cell carriers developed by polymer crosslinking, lithography, or emulsion drops are unable to obtain a structure with uniformed porous structure and porous interior design, which results in an inhomogeneous culture condition for cells and therefore cannot ensure an optimal dynamic culture condition for cell proliferation, matrix production, and cell differentiation. In addition, the fluidic shear stress (a standard mechanical stimulation in bioreactor culture) and inner-carrier velocity (to ensure nutrient transport and waste exchange), which influence cell viability and growth, are not well-controlled/analyzed due to an irregular porous structure with these traditionally synthesized cell carriers. To solve these problems, we designed four types of hollow porous spheres (HPS, 1.0 cm diameter) with different porous structures. To investigate the impacts of porous structure on surface shear stress and inner velocity, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted to analyze the liquid flow behavior in HPSs, based on which an optimal structure with minimal surface shear stress and best inner velocity was obtained and fabricated using fused deposition modeling three-dimensional (3D) printing technology. Inspired by the industrial large-scale culture system, a novel 3D dynamic culture system was then established using HPSs to seed the cells, which were then placed in a mini bioreactor on a tube roller. CFD analysis showed that under 0.1 m/s water flow, the shear stress at most surface areas from four HPSs was lower than 20 dynes/cm2, which suggests that the HPSs should provide protection against physical stress to the cells living on the scaffold surface. A dynamic cell seeding was developed and refined using the 3D culture system, which increased the 32% seeding efficiency of MC3T3 cells compared to the traditional static cell seeding method. The cell proliferation analysis demonstrated that HPSs could speed up cell growth in dynamic cell culture. The HPS with a honeycomb-like structure showed the highest inner pore velocity (CFD analysis) and achieved the fastest cell proliferation and the highest cell viability. Overall, our study, for the first time, developed a 3D printed HPS cell culture device with a uniformed porous structure, which can effectively facilitate cell adhesion and proliferation in the dynamic cultural environment, thereby could be considered an ideal carrier candidate. Cell carrier is critical for anchorage-dependent mammalian cells living in a dynamic bioreactor. This study developed the hollow porous spheres (HPS) as a potential cell carrier to facilitate anchorage-dependent mammalian cell growth in a dynamic culture system. Combining the computational simulation, the study result demonstrates that the velocity of the culture medium inside these cell carriers can improve the efficiency of nutrition and oxygen exchange for cell growth in HPS, which is essential for cell metabolism and viability. This study established a method of three-dimensional (3D) printed cell carrier for cell growth in a dynamic bioreactor, which could potentially be used as a 3D dynamic cell culture approach for future biomedical research.  © 2022 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","3D cell culture;

Considering the existing double-sided graded superlattice (DSGS) EBL structures and comparing their electron and hole concentrations, radiative recombination rate, and energy band diagram in the active region, we find that the electron leakage, power–current curve, voltage–current curve, internal quantum efficiency, and other aspects of the proposed structure can be significantly improved. Therefore, the superlattice EBL structure can more effectively reduce the electron leakage and improve the hole injection efficiency. Compared with the existing DSGS EBL structures, it also demonstrates superior performance for DUV-LDs. © 2022, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","deep-ultraviolet laser diode; electron leakage; radiative recombination rate; superlattice electron-blocking layer","","","","","","","","Chen H.Y., Et al., J.

Wire-based AM processes meet these demands but suffer from higher heat inputs that can lead to thermal distortion and large heat-affected zones neighboring the melt pools. Here, the tensile deformation response of an Al 4043 (Al-Si) alloy deposited on an Al 6061-T6 substrate using a laser hot-wire AM process was investigated. Digital image correlation during tensile testing was combined with optical microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction data to understand the deformation mechanisms that occurred in samples from a deposited wall in the as-built condition. During tensile testing, localized deformation was observed at the melt pool boundary regions that correlated with serrations on the stress-strain curve. The primary aluminum dendrites in regions adjacent to the melt pool boundary regions were coarser than in bulk deposited material, leading to localized deformation of the coarser microstructure. EBSD post-test analysis confirmed that the accumulated strains had occurred in the melt pool boundary regions. Analysis of the thermal and solidification conditions in the melt pool indicated that the coarsened region was associated with partial remelting of the eutectic phase. This understanding of deformation mechanisms associated with the inhomogeneities at melt pool boundaries can enable AM-specific considerations for improved process and alloy design, particularly for eutectic alloys. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Aluminum 4043 alloy; Digital image correlation; Heterogeneous microstructure; Melt pool boundary","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Aluminum coatings; Deformation; Deposition rates; Eutectics; Heat affected zone; Lakes; Microstructure; Optical correlation; Silicon alloys; Solidification; Strain; Strain measurement; Stress-strain curves; Tensile testing; Wire; Additive manufacturing process; Aluminum 4043 alloy; Boundary regions; Deformation mechanism; Digital image correlations; Heterogeneous microstructure; Hot wires; Localized deformations; Melt pool; Melt pool boundary; Image correlation","","","","","Carl Zeiss Industrial Metrology LLC; Mazak Corporation; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE, (DE-AC05–00OR22725); Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL","Funding text 1: This research was performed at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility, located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

However, the combination of high strength and corrosion resistance requires the balanced ratio of austenite and ferrite in microstructure. At the same time, the presence of other secondary phases such as intermetallic phases (σ, χ), carbides (M7C3, M23C6) and nitrides (π, CrN, Cr2N) is strongly undesirable. Additive manufacturing of duplex stainless steel has not been described in detail yet and the existing studies deal with the duplex stainless steels deposited by powder bed methods primarily. This study investigates the properties of steel SAF2507 prepared by the directed energy deposition (DED) method in the as-built state and after post-manufacturing solution annealing at 1100 °C for 60 min followed by water quenching and compares them with the duplex stainless steel additively manufactured by powder methods and conventional ways of preparation. Microstructure, phase composition and mechanical properties of both materials were studied in detail. The material after DED contains of about 28 wt% austenite, which is much more compared to additively manufactured duplex stainless steels by powder bed. The as-built state contained allotriomorphic grain boundary austenite (GBA), Widmanstätten austenite (WA) and intragranular austenite (IGA). Coarsening of austenite occurred during solution annealing, while ferrite's grains size decreased. The solution annealed material achieves approximately the desired ratio of austenite-ferrite 50:50. Yield strength decreased slightly during solution annealing from 680 MPa to 540 MPa, whereas elongation and notch toughness increase. The ductile to brittle transition temperature (about −100 °C) did not change significantly during solution annealing. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Directed energy deposition; Heat treatment; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Super duplex stainless steel","3D printers; Additives; Annealing; Austenite; Carbides; Coarsening; Corrosion resistance; Deposition; Ferrite; Steel corrosion; Directed energy; Directed energy deposition; Energy depositions; High strength and corrosion resistances; Intermetallic-phases; Mechanical property and corrosion resistance; Powder bed; Secondary phase; Solution annealing; Superduplex stainless steels; Grain boundaries","","","","","Ministerstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy, MŠMT; Ministerstvo Průmyslu a Obchodu, MPO, (LM2018110)","The development of this paper was financed by the institutional support of the research organisation (Decision no. 3/2018 of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic) and the specific university research A1_FCHT_2022_007 .

However, there are still important roadblocks impeding the full implementation of these technologies in different application fields such as soft robotics or bioengineering. One of the main bottlenecks is the difficulty to perform topological optimisation of the structures and their functional design. To help this endeavour, computational models are essential. Although 3D formulations provide the most reliable tools, these usually present very high computational costs. Beam models based on 1D formulations may overcome this limitation but they need to incorporate all the relevant mechanical features of the 3D problem. Here, we propose a mixed formulation for Timoshenko-type beams to consistently account for axial, shear and bending contributions under finite deformation theory. The framework is formulated on general bases and is suitable for most types of materials, allowing for the straightforward particularisation of the constitutive description. To prove validity of the model, we provide original experimental data on a 3D printed elastomeric material. We first validate the computational framework using a benchmark problem and compare the beam formulation predictions with numerical results from an equivalent 3D model. Then, we further validate the framework and illustrate its flexibility to predict the mechanical response of beam-based structures. To this end, we perform original experiments and numerical simulations on two types of relevant structures: a rhomboid lattice and a bi-stable beam structure. In both cases, the numerical results provide a very good agreement with the experiments by means of both quantitative and qualitative results. Overall, the proposed formulation provides a useful tool to help at designing new architected materials and metamaterial structures based on beam components. The framework presented may open new opportunities to guide AM techniques by feeding machine learning optimisation algorithms. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; Architected materials; Beam formulation; Finite deformation; Finite element method; Metamaterials","3D modeling; Additives; Computation theory; Deformation; Finite element method; Machine learning; Metamaterials; Structural design; Structural optimization; Application fields; Architected material; Beam formulation; Computational modelling; Finite deformations; Functional design; Manufacturing techniques; Numerical results; Soft robotics; Topological optimization; 3D printers","","","","","Universidad Carlos III de Madrid and Comunidad de Madrid, Spain; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Comunidad de Madrid; European Research Council, ERC; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (PID2020-117894GA-I00); Horizon 2020, (4D-BIOMAP, 947723, CM 2018 - 2018-T2/IND-9992)","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge support from Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 under Grant number PID2020-117894GA-I00 , and the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No. 947723 , project: 4D-BIOMAP).

This localized deposition of material is used for the manufacturing, modification, and repair of a wide range of metal components. The use of wire as feedstock offers various advantages over the use of powder in terms of the contamination of the process environment, the material utilization rate, the ease of handling, and the material price. However, to achieve a stable process as well as defined geometrical and microstructural properties over many layers, precise knowledge on the effects of the input variables of the process on the resulting deposition characteristics is required. In this work, the melt pool temperature was used as an input parameter in LMD with coaxial wire feeding of stainless steel, which was made possible through the use of a dedicated closed-loop control system based on pyrometry. Initially, a temperature range was determined for different process conditions in which a stable deposition was obtained. Within this range, the cause-effect relationships between the melt pool temperature and the resulting geometry as well as the material properties were investigated for individual weld beads. It was found that the melt pool temperature is positively correlated with the width of the weld bead as well as the dilution. In addition, a dependence of the microhardness distribution over the cross section of a weld bead on the melt pool temperature was demonstrated, with an increased temperature negatively affecting the hardness.  © 2022 Author(s).","","Closed loop control systems; Materials handling; Metals; Powder metals; Welds; Wire; A-stable; Additive manufacturing process; Closed-loop control; Defect-free; Free component; Laser induced; Laser metal deposition; Melt pool temperature; Weld bead; Wire feeding; Deposition","","","","","BMWK, (13IK002L); German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action","The results presented were achieved within the AdDEDValue project, which is supported by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) within the funding program “Digitalization of Vehicle Manufacturers and the Supplier Industry” (Contract No. 13IK002L) and supervised by the VDI Technology Center (VDI TZ).

To fully understand the DIW process and improve the geometrical quality of parts, numerical simulations have been widely used to model the DIW process. However, the previous research works for numerical simulation of deposited corners could only achieve the corner simulation under the condition of small angle and failed to realize corner simulation of any angle. Herein, an improved numerical simulation of deposited corners of any angle is proposed based on the use of volume of fluid (VOF) method and then the simulation is validated experimentally. In the numerical simulation, deposited corner is realized by constructing two calculation areas where two nozzle velocities with the corner angle are applied on the substrates of two calculation areas. The effectiveness of the proposed numerical model is validated through corner deposition experiments using a commercially available microcrystalline wax (MW)-based ink in a DIW 3D printer as the simulated corner angles fit experimental angles well and the maximum value of maximum distance deviation between simulated and experimental outlines (MDDSEO) is 1.06 ± 0.06 mm. It was observed that the MDDSEO of corners is larger than MDDSEO of straight filaments and decreases as corner angle increases. The current work demonstrates an effective approach for the prediction of the deposited corners of any angle in DIW based on numerical simulations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Deposited corners; Direct ink writing; Experimental validation; Numerical simulation; Volume of fluid method","3D printers; Numerical models; Condition; Corner angle; Deposited corner; Direct ink writing; Experimental validations; Geometrical quality; Maximum distance; Simulation validation; Volume-of-Fluid method; Writing process; Numerical methods","","","","","China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201906020135); China Scholarship Council, CSC","This work has been supported by the China Scholarship Council (no. 201906020135).

However, such a technology still presents some challenges, mainly related to obtaining optimal deposition parameters, which result in consistent layer geometry which leads to the robot and the welding power source programming. In this sense, the objective of this work is to analyze the influence of the parameters in bead and multi-layer wall geometries fabricated by the Cold Metal Transfer process to select the configurations that result in the best deposition control. The study was carried out in four steps: (i) deposition of single beads on plate, varying wire feed speed and travel speed that would result in stable and sound beads; (ii) deposition of five layer walls, considering both unidirectional and bidirectional path strategies, with and without stops between layers; (iii) deposition of ten and twenty layer walls, refining deposition parameters; and (iv) deposition of a one hundred layer wall, with the best parameter configuration among the previously tested, with bidirectional continuous strategy. The results showed that the geometry produced with a mean current of 62 A and torch travel speed of 8 mm/s along each layer and 24 mm/s on the transition between layers generated the best results, considering the natural cooling conditions. Also, the bidirectional path deposition presented the most regular geometries, when compared to the unidirectional strategy. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; CMT; Geometry analysis; Parameters selection; WAAM","","","","","","Universidade de Brasília, UnB","The authors thank the University of Brasilia for the laboratorial infrastructure and technical support.","Aldalur E., Veiga F., Suarez A., Bilbao J., Lamikiz A., High deposition wire arc additive manufacturing of mild steel: strategies and heat input effect on microstructure and mechanical properties, J.

Specimens heated to 800 C for 1 h at 100 MPa pressure showed grain growth across many prior foil-to-foil interfaces, thereby increasing foil adhesion. In addition to the material softening induced by a loss of Hall-Petch strengthening, premature failure of specimens loaded parallel to the build direction was observed. Premature specimen failure was attributed to the local delamination at prior foil-to-foil boundaries where grain growth was pinned by Ti impurities introduced during the UAM process via the interaction between a Ti-alloy buffer foil and the welded Zr-foils underneath. In addition, the presence of Ti along select foil interfaces resulted in the nucleation and growth of secondary (Zr,Ti)(Fe,Cr) laves phases during higher-temperature thermomechanical processing. Using a combination of micro-scale X-ray computed tomography, fractography, and in-situ digital image correlation, the effect of defects along prior foil-to-foil boundaries was revealed as delamination-assisted plasticity accelerated specimen failure in preferred tensile orientations. These findings underscore the importance of impurity control when optimizing weld quality of higher-strength material systems using ultrasonic welding. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD); Grain growth; Hot isostatic pressing; Tensile test; Ultrasonic additive manufacturing; X-ray tomography; Zirconium","3D printers; Additives; Computerized tomography; Fabrication; Fracture mechanics; Hot isostatic pressing; Sintering; Tensile testing; Titanium alloys; Ultrasonic applications; Welding; Zirconium; Electron back scatter diffraction; Electron backscatter diffraction; Hot-isostatic pressings; Interfacial bonds; Manufacturing techniques; Property; Tensile test; Ultrasonic additive manufacturing; X-ray tomography; Grain growth","","","","","Adam Hehr and Mark Norfolk at Fabrisonic LLC; DNN R&D; Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Research and Development; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA; Allegheny Technologies Incorporated, ATI; Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, UAM","Funding text 1: This manuscript has been authored by UT-Battelle, LLC, under Contract No. DE-AC05–00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy and is based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration, Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Research and Development (DNN R&D).

This paper aims to combine the high strength of carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP), the excellent ductility of aluminium alloy (Al), and the good compressibility of polyurethane (PU) foam. Quasi-static compression and low-velocity impact tests were conducted on thin-walled tubes made of single materials and composite sandwich structures made of multi-materials, namely Al-PU-Al, Al-PU-CFRP, CFRP-PU-Al, and CFRP-PU-CFRP. The structural failure modes and crashworthiness indicators were analysed and compared under different loadings. The results showed that the CFRP thin-walled tube exhibited a progressive damage and failure mode, and the resultant force changed smoothly. The CFRP tube possessed a larger mean crushing force and specific energy absorption than the corresponding aluminium tube. Composite structures exhibited more stable deformation mode and higher energy absorption, compared with the sum of linear superposition (SLS) of individual components, due to the interaction effects among components. Among the designed four combinations, CFRP-PU-CFRP exhibited an ideal energy absorption under both quasi-static and dynamic impact, while CFRP-PU-Al produced the second highest specific energy absorption (SEA), with an increment of 42.0% compared with Al-PU-Al. With full consideration of crashworthiness performance and economic cost, CFRP-PU-Al can be recommended as an impact energy absorber for vehicles due to its lower economic cost than CFRP-PU-CFRP. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP);

A novel surface heat source model considering the arc energy shading effect is proposed and adopted. An improved momentum source of the arc force considering the arc pressure shading effect is also developed and used. This model has been used to study the metal transfer dynamics, flow patterns, and bead shape of the WPAAM process with a wire-feeding speed (WFS) of 1–5 m/min. The simulated results agreed reasonably with the experimental data. As the WFS increased from 1 to 5 m/min, three different metal transfer modes were observed, which changed from globular droplet mode to droplet-liquid bridge mode and solid-liquid bridge mode. Detailed metal transfer information was analysed, including metal transfer position, shape, average temperature, and main driving force. The effects of the arc shading and metal transfer on the melt pool dynamics and bead shape were simulated and discussed. A periodic flow pattern of the melt pool produced by the metal transfer impact causes ripples or even humping defects. As the WFS increased, the melt pool depression gradually disappeared due to the arc pressure shading effect. When the WFS increased to 5 m/min, a temperature drop of about 140 K in the central melt pool, caused by the arc energy shading effect and cold metal transfer, weakened the lateral flow significantly, which explained the decrease of bead width at a large WFS. The results demonstrate that the developed wire-feeding model and findings could be used as a theoretical tool and basis to better understand the underlying physical mechanisms and achieve bead shape control in the WAAM process. © 2022 The Authors","Bead shape; Flow pattern; Metal transfer; WAAM; Wire-feeding","3D printers; Additives; Drops; Feeding; Lakes; Metals; Pressure effects; Wire; Bead shape; Feeding models; Feeding speed; Fluid-flow; Melt pool; Metal transfers; Plasma arc; Shading effect; WAAM; Wire feeding; Flow patterns","","","","","Cranfield University; University of South China, USC","The authors would like to thank the NEWAM project (EP/R027218/1) for financial support.

The isothermal and non-isothermal crystallisation kinetics were explored using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Fast Scanning Calorimetry (FSC). The half-time, onset and ending of crystallisation were obtained for isothermal crystallisation temperatures between 150 °C and 330 °C, while the crystallisation under constant cooling was obtained using rates between − 0.5 K s−1 and − 45 K s−1. The results were used to draw the Continuous Cooling Transformation (CCT) and the Time-Temperature Transformation (TTT) diagrams and calculate the Avrami numbers using the parallel Avrami model. These results were then compared to the degree of crystallinity as a function of time and temperature for the MEX process. To evaluate the crystallisation within the MEX process a 1D transient transfer heat model was used to obtain the printing thermal profile, which was replicated using the FSC technique. The results showed that for the MEX printing process, the crystallisation usually is a product of a combination of rapid cooling and heating processes followed by periods of greater thermal stability which, depending on the nature of the process, can approach a quasi-isothermal crystallisation process. By superimposing the process thermal profile on the TTT and CCT diagrams and comparing the crystallinity values measured from each point in the thermal profile, it was possible to understand the crystallinity evolution and the remelting of the build surface promoted by the subsequent printed layers. © 2022 The Authors","Crystallisation; DSC; FSC; MEX; PEEK","Calorimeters; Cooling; Crystallinity; Extrusion; Graphic methods; Isotherms; Continuous cooling transformation; Cristallinity; Extrusion process; Fast-scanning calorimetries; Function of time; Isothermal cooling; Isothermal crystallization temperature; Material extrusion; Polyetheretherketone; Thermal profiles; Differential scanning calorimetry","","","","","Bond3D High Performance 3D Technology BV; University of Exeter","This work was supported by Bond3D High Performance 3D Technology BV and the University of Exeter .

Herein, the fluorene-based poly (ether ether ketone)s (FD-PEEK) were designed and synthesized to solve the problem. A remarkable improvement in the interlayer strength of materials was achieved. By introducing 10 mol% fluorene groups into the polymer chain (10 %-FD-PEEK), the interlayer strength of 10 %-FD-PEEK was improved to 41 MPa, which is close to that of the commercial PEEK resin for 3D printing (Victrex, AM 200). The introduction of 15 mol% fluorene groups (15 %-FD-PEEK) enabled the interlayer strength and strain at break of 400 % and 500 % higher than that of PEEK, reaching 67 MPa and 11.23 %, respectively. The improvement of the interlayer strength was attributed to the slower crystallizing rate of FD-PEEK, which was verified by the isothermal and non-isothermal crystallization kinetics. Meanwhile, the chain rigidity caused by fluorene groups and the larger spherulite generated by the slower crystallization allowed FD-PEEK to reach a similar tensile strength to PEEK in the X-axis and Y-axis directions. Achieved by slowing crystallization and introducing rigid structure into the molecular chain, the results significantly promote the engineering application of 3D printing parts and provide new insights into the performance enhancement of semi-crystalline additive manufacturing materials. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D printed PEEK; Chain rigidity; Interlayer strength; Slowing crystallization","Crystallization kinetics; Ethers; Finite difference method; Ketones; Kinetics; Polybutadienes; Rigid structures; Rigidity; Tensile strength; 3-D printing; 3d printed PEEK; 3D-printing; Chain rigidity; Fluorenes; Interlayer strength; Molecular design; Poly ether ether ketones; Poly(ether ether ketones); Slowing crystallization; Isotherms","","","","","Key R&D Program of Guangdong Province, (2018B090906001)","Financial support from the Key R&D Program of Guangdong Province (grant 2018B090906001 , China) is gratefully acknowledged.

The idea of the dimension splitting method (DSM) is introduced into the improved element-free Galerkin (IEFG) method, thus a sequence of 2D forms can be obtained by splitting the problem domain of 3D Helmholtz equation, each 2D form can be discretized by using the IEFG method, thus the corresponding 2D discretized equations can be obtained, and these equations can be coupled by employing the finite difference method (FDM) in the dimension splitting direction, thus final formulae of numerical solution for 3D Helmholtz equation can be obtained. In Sec. 4, the relative errors and the convergence are analyzed, respectively, and the numerical results show that the calculation resources can be saved greatly without losing the computational accuracy when using the HEFG method.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","dimension splitting method; Helmholtz equation; Hybrid element-free Galerkin method; improved element-free Galerkin method; meshless method","Convergence of numerical methods; Finite difference method; Galerkin methods; Dimension splitting method; Element-free Galerkin method; Helmholtz's equations; Hybrid element; Hybrid element-free galerkin method; Improved element-free galerkin method; Meshless methods; Splitting method; Splittings; Helmholtz equation","","","","","","","Belytschko T., Lu Y.

The formation kinetics of the secondary phases precipitated by heat-treating of WAAM products differ from those of wrought or cast products because of the heat that accumulates during layer-by-layer deposition. Therefore, the secondary phases in the heat-treated WAAM products differ from those in conventional products according to the microstructural locations, e.g., the dendritic region, interdendritic region, and grain boundaries. To investigate such phase differences, a 100-layer IN718 wall was deposited using cold metal transfer (CMT)-based WAAM and then heat-treated under various conditions. In each heat-treated specimen, the δ, γ’, and γ” phases were identified by microstructural analyses. Based on the results, time–temperature–transformation diagrams were constructed for each microstructural location, which confirmed that the secondary phases were precipitated faster in the interdendritic region and at grain boundaries than those in the dendritic region. In addition, the applicability of single-aging, which can be used to satisfy the desired mechanical properties in less time with less processing, was evaluated by the hardness and tensile tests in the WAAM products. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Cold metal transfer (CMT); Heat treatment; Inconel 718; Precipitation kinetics; Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM)","Additives; Deposition; Grain boundaries; Heat treatment; Kinetics; Location; Precipitation (chemical); Tensile testing; Wire; Cold metal transfer; Cold metal transfers; Formation kinetics; Inconel-718; Manufacturing products; Micro-structural; Precipitation kinetics; Secondary phase; Wire arc; Wire arc additive manufacturing; 3D printers","","","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2020R1C1C1009519); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (No. 2020R1C1C1009519).

In this study, we applied this powder to an AISI D2 substrate via additive manufacturing based on a directed energy deposition process and evaluated the mechanical and metallurgical properties of the FeCrMoVW deposited on the D2 substrate. To this end, microstructural observation and mechanical tests with respect to hardness, impact, compression, and wear were conducted. The properties of the hardfaced substrate were compared to those of AISI D2 (QT-D2), which is obtained through heat treatments such as quenching and tempering, typically used for high-strength cold work tool steel. In the microstructure of the deposited FeCrMoVW (as-built FeCrMoVW), high-hardness carbides were observed with fine cellular dendrites at grain boundaries owing to the melting and quenching of FeCrMoVW powders. The hardness of the deposits was approximately 20% higher than that of QT-D2 (56HRc) because of the presence of fine grains in the deposited zones. Furthermore, the wear resistance and compressive strength of as-built FeCrMoVW increased compared to those of QT-D2. This was attributed to the generation of martensite due to quenching after powder melting. The toughness of as-built FeCrMoVW and QT-D2 were similar (4 J). Furthermore, as-built FeCrMoVW exhibited high hardness, good wear resistance, and high compressive strength owing to the presence of various types and sizes of carbides and martensite. The results of the study confirm that the hardfacing process using FeCrMoVW powder can be applied in industries for increasing the performance of tools and molds used in harsh environments.

However, the characteristics of thermal cycling during the PPA-AM process and the mechanism of subsequent heat treatment on the microstructure and mechanical properties are unclear. In this study, an Al1.2CoCrFeNi2.1 HEA with dual-phase (FCC + B2) was fabricated via PPA-AM. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the as-built and heat-treated samples were explored. The crystallographic orientations of the FCC and B2 phases were also determined. Because the alloy in the bottom region was affected by thermal cycling, B2 particles precipitated in the FCC phase, and FCC particles precipitated in the B2 phase. During the tensile test, the phase boundary between B2 matrix and FCC particles produced cracks preferentially. These cracks reduced the strength and elongation of the alloy. After heat treatment at 1200 °C, the FCC and B2 precipitates formed globular shapes inside the B2 and FCC grain matrix, respectively. The alloy showed a uniform structure and the ductility of the alloy was improved significantly. This work elucidates the mechanisms of thermal cycling and heat treatment on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the alloy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Heat treatment; High-entropy alloy; Mechanical properties; Microstructure","3D printers; Additives; Cobalt alloys; Cracks; Entropy; Fabrication; High-entropy alloys; Iron alloys; Mechanisms; Microstructure; Tensile testing; Thermal cycling; Additive manufacturing process; B2 phase; Effect of heat treatments; FCC phase; High entropy alloys; Manufacturing IS; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Plasma arc; Properties of Al; Thermal-cycling; Heat treatment","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51875213); Wenzhou University, WZU; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2022A1515010065)","Funding text 1: This project is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51875213 ), and the GuangDong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (No. 2022A1515010065 ).

However, existing additive manufacturing (AM) approaches can only treat one material species at a time due to their intrinsic working mechanisms. Here we develop an AM manipulator for manufacturing a wide variety of material species, including polymers, ceramics, and metals, through a multifilament transport strategy assisted by laser power. The six-jaw manipulator contains three pairs of filament delivering/cutting systems for transporting diverse materials and a beam of tunable laser as the thermal source. The whole apparatus is integrated into a robotic manipulator to create a multifreedom manufacturing platform. With this innovation, products with multiple material species and desired complex geometries can be fabricated on demand. Furthermore, we synthesize a multimaterial (polymer/ceramic/metal) printed magnetoelectric pressure sensor that can convert applied mechanical forces to electricity and maintain efficiency even after undergoing 10000 cycles of pressure/recovery. With this multimaterial filament transport and laser manufacturing strategy, our AM manipulator exhibits promising application in the advanced manufacturing of embedded electronics, sensors, soft robotics, and customizable medical devices. © 2022, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","additive manufacturing; laser; magnetoelectric; manipulator; multiple materials","3D printers; Additives; Fabrication; Pressure sensors; Robotics; Desired position; End-uses; Fabrication cost; Fabrication time; Magnetoelectrics; Multi materials; Multifilaments; Multiple materials; Polymer metals; Working mechanisms; Manipulators","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China Aerospace Advanced Manufacturing Technology, (U2037203); Huazhong University of Science and Technology, HUST; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (YCJJ202202010); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China Aerospace Advanced Manufacturing Technology Research Joint Fund (Grant No. U2037203, 2020) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. YCJJ202202010).

One of the main sources for this issue is the difficulty with accurately controlling ink flow rate at smaller size scales. Towards addressing this limitation, this paper elucidates complex ink flow mechanisms that renders flow rate control difficult and explores printing implementations to increase flow rate accuracy in direct-ink-writing at the micro scale. To this end, a DIW system utilizing hybrid pressure and velocity-controlled extrusion is used to obtain pressure-flow rate relationships for a water-based sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC) solution ink, as a function of printing nozzle diameter (510–100 µm). These studies showed that the transient response of piston velocity-controlled extrusion significantly slows down with decreasing nozzle diameter. For pressure-controlled extrusion, the wall slip increases with decreasing nozzle diameter and the constant slip velocity assumption no longer holds as nozzle size decreases below a certain diameter. To contextualize the influence of such behavior on flow rate accuracy, temperature-controlled parallel plate rheometry was performed on the inks and rheological ink models were accordingly determined. It was shown that the associated flow rate predictions under predicted flow rates due to lack of wall-slip consideration, particularly for smaller nozzle sizes. Lastly, an iterative pressure-controlled DIW implementation was explored to address the accuracy issues for micro-DIW. Our results indicated significant improvement in the transient response and flow rate accuracy for nozzle diameters as small as 100 µm using this approach compared to both of the conventional pressure and velocity control approaches. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Micro extrusion; Non-Newtonian; Rheology; Wall slip; Water-based ink","Accuracy; Extrusion; Flow Measurement; Ink; Nozzles; Pressure; Velocity; Extrusion; Flow rate; Non Newtonian flow; Nozzles; Transient analysis; Velocity; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Controlled extrusions; Ink flow; Microextrusion; Non-newtonian; Nozzle diameter; Rate accuracies; Wall-slip; Water-based inks; 3D printers","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1825872, 1842493); National Science Foundation, NSF","This work was financially supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) grant 1825872 and NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Award 1842493 .

In connection with this, a new line of research has emerged to replace lead-based ceramic materials with their lead-free counterparts. Rising energy costs and the need to reduce environmental impact also require more efficient and sustainable manufacturing processes for piezoceramics. The ceramics industry is an energy-intensive industry and has great potential for improving energy efficiency, mainly by introducing modern sintering technologies. Although the toxicity of the raw materials and high energy consumption are forms of the adverse environmental impact of the technological process, the management strategies are different for each one. Several technological approaches have now been developed to lower the cost of energy in the production of ceramics. There is also significant potential to improve environmental friendliness, for example by introducing additive manufacturing methods and new methods of sintering as well as by the manufacture of composites. This article presents a brief analysis of the prospects for introducing 3D printing methods in the production of piezoceramics and piezoelectric composites from the standpoint of perfecting a strategy for mitigating environmental impact. © 2022, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","3D printing; additive technologies; lead-free piezo ceramics; piezo ceramic composites; piezo ceramics; sustainability","3D printers; Additives; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental technology; Piezoelectric ceramics; Piezoelectricity; Sintering; Sustainable development; Toxicity; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Additive technology; Ceramic composites; Lead-Free; Lead-free piezo ceramic; Piezo ceramic composite; Piezo-ceramics; Environmental impact","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (20-19-00780); Russian Science Foundation, RSF","This work was supported by the Russian Science Foundation under grant 20-19-00780.","“RoHS Compliance Engineer R.

An advanced design paradigm is necessary to develop customized and process-tailored reactor solutions able to provide the optimal operating conditions, transport properties and geometry. This can be achieved by a detailed understanding of the catalyst functionality in the reactive environment. Multiscale Modeling provides such in-depth insights into the complex physical-chemical phenomena enabling to achieve a first-principles-based understanding and design of the most suitable reactor geometry and configuration. To overcome the intrinsic complexity of the approach, Machine Learning can be synergically employed to reduce the computational cost fostering the inclusion of detailed numerical simulations since the early stage of the design process. Moreover, hybrid machine learning models trained with the data and enforced by the physics are envisioned to assist the work of designers facilitating the development of disruptive intensified solutions. The manufacturing of these unconventional systems requires adequate techniques. Additive Manufacturing is showing enormous potential in this direction and their future developments are expected to make it possible to routinely fabricate intensified reactors. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Catalytic reactors; Machine learning; Multiscale modeling; Process intensification","Additives; Chemical industry; Machine learning; Sustainable development; Advanced designs; Catalyst functionality; Catalytic reactor; Design paradigm; Machine-learning; Model machine; Multiscale modeling; Optimal operating conditions; Process intensification; Sustainable production; 3D printers","","","","","","","Keil F.J., Process intensification, Rev.

Past studies demonstrated how FOS strain data could be used to reconstruct the static and dynamic deformed shapes of a flexible wing. The current study further develops these capabilities and demonstrates wing shape control. Specifically, FOS-measured strain data are used in an optimization scheme, with a target of keeping the wing’s elastic deformations small, below a user-defined threshold, while maintaining a constant lift value (as required for trimmed flight) and with minimal usage of the control surfaces. The method is demonstrated computationally and experimentally on a wing model with four control surfaces. The wing was designed for this study, fabricated using additive manufacturing, and wind-tunnel tested. The trim optimization is performed both computationally and experimentally, following the same procedures but using strain and strain-modes data from finite element analysis and experiments. The wind-tunnel study demonstrated how a flexible wing’s shape could be controlled based on experimental strain data only, without resorting to a computational model. In both the computational and experimental parts of the study, considerable control-surface deformations were required. This primarily indicates that large control surfaces are not the optimal means for wing shape control. However, the same strain-based technique can be used with other effectors, such as distributed control surfaces, strain actuators, etcetera. The study opens a path to using FOSs to optimize winged unmanned-aerial-vehicle performance, and thus design lighter and more efficient platforms. © 2022, AIAA International.

Multiple experiments were systematically conducted to further understand the fundamentals and limitation of this manufacturing process, and a novel 3D mixer and a fluorescent chemosensor assay used to determine dopamine concentration at high-alkaline pH conditions were successfully demonstrated. Experiment results showed: (1) the 3D mixer is superior than conventional 2D mixer regarding mixing performance and repeatability, (2) dopamine detection and pH indicator can be realized with fewer operation steps and shorter processing time, (3) a truly 3D µPAD, including multilayer microchannels within a monolithic paper substrate, can be created with fewer reagent loss and higher transportation efficiency, (4) a smallest microchannel, 100 µm wide microchannel, can be successfully created on µPAD. These results clearly proved that this proposed 3D µPAD is not only a novel format of µPAD, but it can also simplify the operation steps for an analytical assay while improving the mixing phenomenon via 3D mixer and using minimum sample volume. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Dopamine detection; Mixing on 3D- µPAD; Monolithic 3D µPADs; Sequential digital masks; Stereolithography 3D printing","3D printers; Alkalinity; Amines; Analytic equipment; Microchannels; Microfluidics; Mixing; Neurophysiology; pH; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Dopamine detections; Manufacturing process; Mixing on 3d- µPAD; Monolithic 3d µPAD; Monolithics; Paper-based analytical devices; Sequential digital mask; Stereolithography 3d printing; Mixers (machinery)","","","","","Chemistry Department of National Tai-wan Normal University; Mechanical Engineering Department of National Taiwan University of Science and Technology; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (110-2628-E-011-006, MOST-110-2113-M-003-009); Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST; National Taiwan Normal University, NTNU; National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, NTUST","This research was funded by Ministry of Science and Technology with grant numbers of MOST 110-2628-E-011-006 and MOST-110-2113-M-003-009 , the Mechanical Engineering Department of National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST) and Chemistry Department of National Tai-wan Normal University (NTNU).

However, its poor weldability and easy occurrence of cracks during the highly non-equilibrium process have limited the adoption of this material for AM. In this research, various DED process conditions were employed to fabricate crack-free Al 7075 samples, and double aging combined with solution treatment was performed on the as-built materials thanks to the precipitation hardening nature of Al 7075. The influences of DED process parameters and heat treatment on microstructure and mechanical properties were investigated. It was found that the setting of laser power at 280 W and scanning speed at 500 mm/min led to crack-free material deposition with the highest density among all conditions investigated. Compared with the as-built Al 7075, the average micro-hardness of the alloy increased from 91.73 to 144.91 HV, and the ultimate tensile strength increased from 233.18 to 342.16 MP after heat treatment. Meanwhile, it was discovered that mass Cu elements are segregated at grain boundaries (GBs) for the as-built material. The existence of Al2Cu phase at GBs is believed to effectively mitigate the hot cracking, and the coherent strengthening mechanism of Cu segregation to the Al GBs is discussed. In addition, it was shown that Mg and Zn contents increased at the GBs after heat treatment, which tend to form precipitated phases and lead to the improved mechanical properties for DED produced Al 7075. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Al 7075 alloy; Grain boundary; Laser directed energy deposition; Mechanical properties; Segregation; Tensile strength","Age hardening; Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Copper; Cracks; Deposition; Grain boundaries; High strength alloys; Microhardness; Microstructure; Al 7075; Al 7075 alloy; Crack free; Directed energy; Energy depositions; Grain-boundaries; Laser directed energy deposition; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Process parameters; Segregation; Tensile strength","","","","","","","Imran M., Khan A.A., Characterization of Al-7075 metal matrix composites: a review, J.

In LMD, it is crucial that both the laser intensity and powder mass flow distribution within the process zone are precisely matched for a welding bead of predefined shape and a consistent layer quality. While there are many common tools for the characterization of laser intensity distributions, a deep understanding of powder propagation behavior is still missing. Therefore, the present work thoroughly characterizes the powder stream propagation behavior of a discrete coaxial nozzle with three angle-adjustable powder jets. A line laser is used to selectively illuminate individual layers horizontally to the nozzle, and the intensity of the illuminated powder is recorded with the aid of a CCD camera. An envelope of the powder distribution is then plotted from the individual layers, analogous to a caustic of a laser beam, and, thus, the powder stream is evaluated. A novel method is presented to compensate for the radial asymmetry of a discrete powder nozzle in the evaluation, thus making it comparable with continuous nozzles. The method is validated by characterizing the powder stream propagation behavior of a three-jet discrete nozzle. Influencing factors on the powder stream are the protective gas flow, the powder mass flow, the angle of the powder nozzles, and the interaction of the three powder jets. The investigations are supplemented by a point-particle large-eddy simulation of the particle-laden flow.  © 2022 Author(s).","","CCD cameras; Deposition; Large eddy simulation; Laser beams; Mass transfer; Nozzles; Powder metals; Coaxial nozzles; Flow distribution; Large components; Laser intensities; Laser metal deposition; Laser powders; Powder mass flow; Powder process; Powder stream; Propagation behavior; Flow of gases","","","","","HLRN; North-German Supercomputing Alliance; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (424886092)","The work was supported by the North-German Supercomputing Alliance (HLRN).

This is based on their high thermal and mechanical stress resistance as well as their high wear resistance to corrosive and abrasive loads. However, cobalt is a cost-intensive material that is difficult to machine. Moreover, increasingly complex structures and the optimisation of resource efficiency also require additive manufacturing steps for the production or repair of components in many sectors. Concerning inhomogeneity and anisotropy of the microstructure and properties as well as manufacturing-related stresses, a lot of knowledge is still necessary for the economic use of additive welding processes in SMEs. As a result of the high stresses on the components and requirements for a high surface quality, a complementary use of additive and machining manufacturing processes is necessary. Thereby, Co–Cr alloys are extremely challenging for machining with geometrically defined cutting edges because of their low thermal conductivity combined with high strength and toughness. An approach to solve this problem is to refine and homogenise the microstructure. This is achieved by modifying the alloy with elements zirconium and hafnium, which are added up to a maximum of 1 wt.-%. A reduction of the process forces and stresses on the tool and work piece surface is also achievable via hybrid milling processes. There are already studies on the combined use of additive and machining manufacturing processes based on laser technology. However, knowledge based on powder and wire-based arc processes is important, as these processes are more widespread. Furthermore, the effects on the surface zone of additively manufactured components by hybrid finish milling have not yet been a subject of research. The results show that the structural morphology could be significantly influenced with the addition of zirconium and hafnium. © 2022, The Author(s).","Co–Cr-alloy; Modification of structural morphology; Plasma-transferred arc welding; Ultrasonic-assisted milling","Chromium; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Hard facing; High strength alloys; Microstructure; Morphology; Structural optimization; Wear resistance; Zirconium; Co-Cr alloys; Cobalt-chromium alloys; High thermal; Manufacturing process; Modification of structural morphology; Plant construction; Plasma transferred arc welding; Structural morphology; Surface finishing; Ultrasonic-assisted millings; Additives","","","","","Allianz Industrie Forschung, AiF; Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie, BMWi","The IGF project IGF No. 20.979 N (DVS 01.3211) of the Research Association of the DVS was supported by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy by the AiF as part of the program for support of the cooperative industrial research (IGF) on the basis of a decision by the German Bundestag.

Roudebush VA Medical Center, Indianapolis, 46202, IN, United States","The middle ear bones (‘ossicles’) may become severely damaged due to accidents or to diseases. In these situations, the most common current treatments include replacing them with cadaver-derived ossicles, using a metal (usually titanium) prosthesis, or introducing bridges made of biocompatible ceramics. Neither of these solutions is ideal, due to the difficulty in finding or producing shape-matching replacements. However, the advent of additive manufacturing applications to biomedical problems has created the possibility of 3D-printing anatomically correct, shape- and size-personalized ossicle prostheses. To demonstrate this concept, we generated and printed several models of ossicles, as solid, porous, or soft material structures. These models were first printed with a plottable calcium phosphate/hydroxyapatite paste by extrusion on a solid support or embedded in a Carbopol hydrogel bath, followed by temperature-induced hardening. We then also printed an ossicle model with this ceramic in a porous format, followed by loading and crosslinking an alginate hydrogel within the pores, which was validated by microCT imaging. Finally, ossicle models were printed using alginate as well as a cell-containing nanocellulose-based bioink, within the supporting hydrogel bath. In selected cases, the devised workflow and the printouts were tested for repeatability. In conclusion, we demonstrate that moving beyond simplistic geometric bridges to anatomically realistic constructs is possible by 3D printing with various biocompatible materials and hydrogels, thus opening the way towards the in vitro generation of personalized middle ear prostheses for implantation. © 2022 by the authors.","3D bioprinting; additive manufacturing; biocompatible materials; bioink; digital design; embedded 3D printing; microCT; ossicle; personalized medicine; prosthesis","","","","","","Kinoshita memorial enterprise subsidy; Cosmetology Research Foundation","This work was supported by KOSÉ Cosmetology Research Foundation (TF) and Kinoshita memorial enterprise subsidy (TF).

In this study, we propose a dual-modality quantitative phase contrast microscopic (DQPCM) platform that integrates quantitative differential interference phase-contrast microscopy (qDIC-PCM) and quantitative Zernike phase-contrast microscopy (qZ-PCM) in the same microscopy. Both imaging modalities are realized through spatial light modulator (SLM) based pupil phase modulation, and switching between the two imaging modes is performed by rotating two polarizers. Both imaging modalities have the merits of high stability and low coherent noise due to their common path interference structure and partially coherent illumination. The experimental results indicate that qDIC-PCM is superior to qZ-PCM in quantitative phase imaging of samples with certain scattering, while qZ-PCM has higher spatial resolution than qDIC-PCM. The proposed technique will be very helpful for imaging the dynamic processes of biological samples with high spatiotemporal resolution. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Biological dynamics; Dual-modality; High spatiotemporal resolution; Label free; Quantitative phase imaging","Light modulators; Biological dynamics; Differential interference; Dual-modality; High spatiotemporal resolution; Interference phase contrast microscopies; Label free; Phase-contrast microscopy; Quantitative phase contrasts; Quantitative phase imaging; Spatio-temporal resolution; Phase modulation","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12104354, 62075177, 62105251); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, (2021JQ-184); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFE0100700); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (QTZX22039, XJS210503, XJS210504); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2020A1515110590); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC 62105251 , 62075177 , 12104354 ); the Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, China ( 2021JQ-184 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China ( XJS210503 , XJS210504 , and QTZX22039 ), Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2022YFE0100700 ), and Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation, China ( 2020A1515110590 ).

The antenna is composed of two stacked layers which are responsible for right-handed circularly polarized (RHCP) radiation in K-band and left-handed circularly polarized (LHCP) radiation in Ka-band. Each stacked layer consists of a GW power distribution network to excite 16 radiating units from a single input. A waffle grid is mounted on top of the array structure to increase effective aperture areas and reduce grating lobes. A prototype was fabricated using stereo lithography appearance (SLA) 3D printing and metallization technology, which significantly decreased the fabrication cost and complexity. Measurement results for the antenna prototype demonstrate the operating bandwidths of 19.91–20.52 GHz in K-band and 28.26–29.19 GHz in Ka-band, over which the reflection coefficients of <−10 dB and axial ratios of <3 dB are achieved. The prototype provides peak gains of 20.1 and 20.3 dB with total efficiencies of >90% in the two respective bands. The combination of dual-band, dual-circularly polarized capability, high gain, high efficiency, lightweight, low cost and compact size renders the proposed design a potential candidate for commercial millimeter wave communication applications. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing technology; antenna array; dual-band dual-circularly polarized; gap waveguide (GW)","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62133013); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFA0717500); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was fund by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2021YFA0717500, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62133013, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.","Majeed A., Zhang J., Awan Z.A., Memon S., Ishfaq M., Wang C., A high-efficiency dual-band linear-to-circular polarization converter based on rectangular-slot reflective metasurface, Appl.

Hence, the present research develops a topology optimization method dedicated for surface fiber reinforcement design. The targeting part is composed of fiber contents reinforcing the boundary contour and isotropic substrate materials infilling the structural interior. The idea of full-scale modeling of the fiber contents and the approach of addressing the bi-modulus reinforcement effect are highlighted. Specifically, under the SIMP framework, the fiber contents (including the fiber materials and the wrapping matrix materials) are identified through boundary layer extraction with double layers of density smoothing and projection, and the reinforcement fiber materials are recognized through analytical skeleton extraction from the boundary layer. In this manner, constant-thickness fiber contents are modeled and more importantly, stringently incorporated into the topology optimization problem formulation. Both the boundary layer thickness and the fiber reinforcement thickness can be explicitly controlled by modifying the projection threshold parameters. Compliance minimization problems are considered in the current study. Sensitivities of the objective and constraint functions are derived to guide the design update. Several numerical and experimental examples are provided to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method, especially disclosing the impact on the derived topological structures by incorporating boundary layer fibers. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Composite structures; Fiber reinforcement; Topology optimization","3D printers; Additives; Boundary layer flow; Extraction; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Numerical methods; Shape optimization; Structure (composition); Substrates; Topology; Composites structures; Fiber materials; Fiber reinforcement (e); Fibers content; Fibre-reinforced; Scale topologies; Substrate material; Surface fibers; Topology optimisation; Topology Optimization Method; Boundary layers","","","","","Shandong University, SDU; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (RGPIN-2020-03956); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; China Scholarship Council, CSC, (CSC 202108180014); China Scholarship Council, CSC; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, (ZR2020QE165); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52105462); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","The authors would like to acknowledge the support from NSERC discovery grant for Prof. Yongsheng Ma (RGPIN-2020-03956), National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 52105462, the support from Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (ZR2020QE165), and the support from China Scholarship Council PhD scholarship (CSC 202108180014) awarded to Mr. Shuzhi Xu and Shandong University Qilu Young Scholar award given to Dr. Jikai Liu.","Li Q., Sigmund O., Jensen J.S., Aage N., Reduced-order methods for dynamic problems in topology optimization: A comparative study, Comput.

A series of 2D arrays of random numbers are directly generated to encode the ghosts, i.e., original signals or images. The generated 2D arrays of random numbers are sequentially embedded into amplitude-only spatial light modulator (SLM), and are illuminated to propagate through scattering media in free space. Experimental results show feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, and different types of ghosts (e.g., analog signals and grayscale images) can be encoded and retrieved with high fidelity. In addition, comparisons using different algorithm parameters and different experimental parameters (e.g., different diffraction distances and wavelengths) are conducted to analyze and illustrate performance of the proposed method. It is found that the proposed method possesses high robustness against scattering media, and can realize high-fidelity ghost diffraction and optical information transmission. The proposed high-fidelity optical ghost diffraction could open up an avenue for many applications, e.g., free-space optical transmission through scattering media. @ 2022. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","2D arrays of random numbers;

While data are available on the instantaneous properties of additively manufactured PETG, few research have been done on forecasting the creep behaviour of additively manufactured PETG while accounting for the material altering effects of ageing. This research article aims to enhance the understanding of both the instantaneous and time-dependent mechanical properties of additively manufactured PETG through a series of tensile, FEA simulations, Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA), and two types of creep experiments. The details of experimental and mathematical calculations of the instantaneous and time-dependent properties of additively manufactured PETG are provided. Nine independent material parameters have been determined including three Young's moduli, three shear moduli and three Poisson's ratios, to fully quantify an orthotropic material model of additively manufactured PETG. The printed material exhibited a Young's modulus that is 86.5% of the theoretically possible value in direction 1, a Young's modulus in direction 2 is 66.0% of the theoretical optimum, and a Young's modulus in direction 3 is within 1% of its theoretical maximum. In addition to reporting the creep behaviour of PETG, the novel application of the Time-Temperature Superposition Principle (TTSP) to additively manufactured PETG has been shown to produce an age-affected creep prediction for up to 3.88 years based on samples aged for 221 h and at 23 °C. The methodology and data models have been found to enable predictions for other ages and temperatures. It was concluded that the application of the TTSP creep methodology was limited by the creep test temperature, 60 °C, after which the material began to behave in a non rheologically-simple manner. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Aging; Creep; Material extrusion; Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PETG); Tensile properties; Time-Temperature Superposition Principle (TTSP)","Creep; Extrusion; Forecasting; Glycols; Plastic bottles; Tensile strength; Time series analysis; Creep behaviors; Effect of ageing; Material extrusion; Polyethylene terephthalate glycol; Polyethylene terephthalate glycols; Property; Time dependent; Time-temperature superposition principle; Time-temperature superposition principles; Young modulus; Elastic moduli","","","","","Innovative Manufacturing Cooperative Research Centre; University of Technology Sydney, UTS, (IMCRC/MTC/290418); Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, Australian Government","Funding text 1: The research study described herein is supported by an Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship and is a collaboration between the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), the Innovative Manufacturing Cooperative Research Centre (IMCRC) and Downer, via its subsidiary Mineral Technologies.

We developed an efficient coupled process model for a steel wall to simulate the interaction between WAAM deposition and rolling. The predicted RS distributions and wall dimensions agree well with experimental results. Cyclic variation of longitudinal tensile RS occurs during WAAM deposition and inter-layer rolling in clamped condition. The influence depth of deposition and rolling is characterised by the number of the underlying layers that are plastically deformed after each process cycle. For the inter-layer rolling with a flat roller, the rolling has smaller influence depth than the deposition; consequently, the rolling does not eliminate but rather contains the regeneration of WAAM tensile RS after thermal cycles. Rolling with a slotted roller introduces more tensile plastic strain and thereby more effectively reduces WAAM tensile RS and unclamping distortion. Compared to the inter-layer rolling, stacked-four-layer rolling has larger influence depth and hence achieves similar RS mitigation efficacy with fewer rolling operations, while post-build rolling has lower efficacy due to insufficient penetration. Therefore, stacked-layers rolling with slotted roller is recommended for an optimal hybrid process of WAAM and rolling. © 2022 The Authors","Cold working; Directed energy deposition; Distortion; Numerical simulation; Residual stress","3D printers; Additives; Cold working; Deposition; Rollers (machine components); Directed energy; Directed energy deposition; Energy depositions; High pressure; Hybrid process; Influence depths; Inter-layers; Large-scales; Tensile residual stress; Wire arc; Residual stresses","","","","","WAAMMat; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/R027218/1)","Initial part of this research was guided and supported by Dr. Paul Colegrove.

Herein, a series of Mg-xGd-3Y-0.2Zr (wt%, x = 9, 12, 15, and 18) alloys was manufactured by LDED, respectively. The microstructure evolution, hardness, tensile properties and fracture behavior were characterized and the effects of Gd addition were systematically explored. With the increment of Gd content, epitaxial growth at the bottom of melting pool transforms to equiaxed growth. The size of equiaxed dendritic grains shows negligible changes, whereas the intermetallic phase increases to a large extent from 1.51% to 15.92% (volume fraction). The Vickers hardness presents a linear growth against Gd content, and peaks at x = 18 wt% (118 Hv). Furthermore, the variation trend of the yield strength (YS) was rationalized by using the superposition law, according to which solute atoms in supersaturated solid solution (i.e. α-Mg matrix) and the intermetallic phase provided the main contribution. The highest YS (230 MPa) appears in Mg-15Gd-3Y-0.2Zr alloy, in contrast, the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) peaks at x = 12 and 15 wt%, at around 260 MPa. Noticeably, the hardness, YS, UTS, and elongation of Mg-xGd-3Y-0.2Zr alloys manufactured by LDED are generally superior to those of their as-cast counterparts. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Gd effects; Laser directed energy deposition; Mechanical properties; Mg-Gd-Y-Zr alloys","3D printers; Additives; Deposition; Fracture mechanics; Gadolinium alloys; Intermetallics; Tensile strength; Textures; Vickers hardness; Yttrium alloys; Zircaloy; Additive manufacturing process; Directed energy; Energy depositions; Gd contents; Gd effect; Intermetallic-phases; Large-scale engineering; Laser directed energy deposition; Microstructure evolutions; Ultimate tensile strength; Magnesium alloys","","","","","Defense Industrial Technology Development Program, (JCKY2021601B203); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51905023, 51971130); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFB0703400); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This research was financially supported by the Defense Industrial Technology Development Program (No. JCKY2021601B203 ), National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2018YFB0703400 ), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51905023 , 51971130 ).","Zhang J., Liu S., Wu R., Hou L., Zhang M., Recent developments in high-strength Mg-RE-based alloys: Focusing on Mg-Gd and Mg-Y systems, J.

The defects occurred significantly compromise structural integrity and mechanical properties of fabricated parts. Therefore, there is an urgent need in fast, yet reliable AM component certification. Most finite element analysis related methods characterize defects based on the thermomechanical relationships, which are computationally inefficient and cannot capture process uncertainty. In addition, there is a growing trend in data-driven approaches on characterizing the empirical relationships between thermal history and anomaly occurrences, which focus on modeling an individual image basis to identify local defects. Despite their effectiveness in local anomaly detection, these methods are quite cumbersome when applied to layer-wise anomaly detection. This paper proposes a novel in situ layer-wise anomaly detection method by analyzing the layer-by-layer morphological dynamics of melt pools and heat affected zones (HAZs). Specifically, the thermal images are first preprocessed based on the g-code to assure unified orientation. Subsequently, the melt pool and HAZ are segmented, and the global and morphological transition metrics are developed to characterize the morphological dynamics. New layer-wise features are extracted, and supervised machine learning methods are applied for layer-wise anomaly detection. The proposed method is validated using the directed energy deposition (DED) process, which demonstrates superior performance comparing with the benchmark methods. The average computational time is significantly shorter than the average build time, enabling in situ layer-wise certification and real-time process control.

It reduces the diffraction efficiency of the SLM, as a result, the accuracy of the wavefront modulation will be reduced. To reduce the fly-back zone error, this paper proposes a zoning variable module phase wrapping method based on the grayscale segmentation, which is marked as the module-n1π-n2π method. The experimental results show that the root-mean-square (RMS) value of the astigmatism term's deviation is from 0.0413λ reduced to 0.0277λ, which proves that the proposed method can improve the reconstruction accuracy of the non-rotationally symmetric aberrations and can effectively reduce the fly-back zone error. Compared with the traditional module-2π method, the module-n1π-n2π method does not need to consider the 2π correction of the modulation depth, therefore, it is more flexible and convenient. With the improvement of the wavefront modulation accuracy of SLMs, it will play a more important role in adaptive interferometry for optical freeform surfaces. © 2022","Phase modulation curve; Spatial light modulator; The fly-back zone error; Wavefront modulation","Errors; Light modulation; Light modulators; Optical signal processing; Wavefronts; Gray scale; Mean square values; Modulation curve; Phase modulation curve; Phase wrapping; Reconstruction accuracy; Root Mean Square; Spatial light modulators; The fly-back zone error; Wavefront modulations; Phase modulation","","","","","Technology Program of Shaanxi Province of China, (2014K07-02); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52075429, 92060110); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province, (20202BAB204019); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( NSFC No.92060110, 52075429 ) and the Technology Program of Shaanxi Province of China ( 2014K07-02 ), and Jiangxi Provincial Natural Science Foundation ( 20202BAB204019 ).

In this paper, we apply numerology, mini-slot based transmission, and punctured scheduling techniques to support eMBB and URLLC network slices. For efficient allocation of radio resources (e.g., physical resource blocks, transmit power) to the users, we formulate RAN slicing problem as a multi-timescale problem. To solve this problem and address the dynamics of the traffic, we propose a hierarchical deep learning framework. Specifically, in each long time slot, the service provider employs a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to determine the slice configuration parameters. The eMBB and URLLC schedulers use their own attention-based deep neural network (DNN) algorithm to allocate radio resources to their corresponding users in each short and mini time slot, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can achieve a higher aggregate throughput and a higher service level agreement (SLA) satisfaction ratio compared to some other RAN slicing approaches, including the resource proportional placement algorithm, decomposition and relaxation based resource allocation algorithm, and distributed bandwidth optimization algorithm.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Attention mechanism; deep reinforcement learning (DRL); enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB); network slicing; radio access network (RAN); ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC)","Deep neural networks; Heuristic algorithms; Quality of service; Radio; Radio access networks; Reinforcement learning; Resource allocation; Scheduling; Attention mechanisms; Deep learning; Deep reinforcement learning; Enhanced mobile broadband; Heuristics algorithm; Low-latency communication; Mobile broadband; Network slicing; Radio access network; Radio access networks; Reinforcement learnings; Resource management; Ultra reliable low latency communication; Ultra-reliable low-latency communication; Wireless communications; Bandwidth","","","","","","","Katsalis K., Nikaein N., Schiller E., Ksentini A., Braun T., Network slices toward 5G communications: Slicing the LTE network, IEEE Commun.

Three different representative volumetric AM structures were built and subsequently characterized. The parts show a sound visual appearance with the absence of macroscopic cracks or severe distortion. The fabricated parts exhibit high density and the value depends on the welding sequence applied; while the thin- and medium-walled structure has a relative density of ~100% and 99.875%, the measured relative density of the volumetric structure is slightly reduced to ~99.131% due to the smaller periodic bonding defects. However, a higher density could be achieved compared to powder-based processes on refractory metal. The mean hardness value of the fabricated AM structures is approx. 366–380 HV1 and is in the range of approx. 89–93% of the conventionally fabricated substrate of 410 ± 39 HV1. A coarsening of the grains from the bottom to the top and a change in morphology can be noted for all AM structures. While the coarsening is quite severe for the thin-walled structure, it is moderate for the volumetric AM structures due to the change of the thermal boundary conditions. Caused by the deposition process, the microstructure in the substrate also changes and exhibits a coarse-grained heat-affected zone. Nevertheless, the grain size is still smaller compared to the AM bulk material. © 2022 The Author(s)","Direct energy deposition; Electron beam additive manufacturing; Refractory metal; Tungsten; Wire-based additive manufacturing","Additives; Coarsening; Deposition; Electron beams; Heat affected zone; Morphology; Refractory metals; Thin walled structures; Wire; Coarsenings; Direct energy deposition; Electron beam additive manufacturing; Electron beam technique; Electron-beam; Energy depositions; Pure tungsten; Relative density; Volumetrics; Wire-based additive manufacturing; 3D printers","","","","","TU Graz, Internationale Beziehungen und Mobilitätsprogramme; Christian Doppler Forschungsgesellschaft, CDG","RHB foster the CD-Laboratory for Design of High-Performance Alloys by Thermomechanical Processing with the support of the Christian Doppler Society.

The use of a rotating mandrel to fabricate tubular scaffolds using this technique is increasing in popularity; however, the translation of many novel scaffold designs that have been explored on flat collectors has yet to be realized using mandrels. This study reports novel tools to automatically generate scaffold gcode for several new tubular scaffold designs, investigating a range of auxetic pore geometries and open unit cell designs. Through optimization of printing parameters, the novel scaffold designs are successfully printed and mechanically tested to assess tensile properties. Open unit cells significantly reduce the tensile stiffness of scaffolds manufactured with closed pores. Auxetic scaffolds could also be widely tuned using the novel gcode generator tool to exhibit similar stress–strain profiles to typical crosshatch scaffolds but could be made to expand to desired radial dimensions. Finally, heterogeneous auxetic constructs are also fabricated with regions of various radial compliances. This study presents several, mechanically validated novel scaffold designs that are of interest for future applications in targeted tissue engineering product development as well as in soft robotic actuation. © 2022 The Authors.

However, wide adoption of WAAM technologies has been limited by low shape accuracy, high surface roughness, and poor reproducibility. Since WAAM part quality is affected by a multitude of factors related to part geometries, materials, and process parameters, experimental characterization or physics-based simulation for WAAM process optimization can be cost prohibitive, particularly for new part designs. As an effective alternative, data-analytical approaches have been developed for prescriptive modeling and compensation of shape deviations in 3D printed parts. However, WAAM faces a unique challenge of large shape deviation and high surface roughness at the same time. Accurate prediction and control of WAAM part quality require process-meaningful error decomposition under geometric measurement uncertainties. We propose a generalized additive modeling approach to separate global geometric shape deformation from surface roughness. Under this statistical framework, tensor product basis expansion is adopted to learn both the low-order shape deformation and highorder roughness patterns. The established predictive model enables optimal geometric compensation for product redesign to reduce shape deformation from the target geometry without altering process parameters. Experimental validation on WAAM manufactured cylindrical walls of various radii shows the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

These powders are then simultaneously fused together by a high powered (0.1–1 kW, often ND:YAG) laser to form a deposited layer. Out of the various nozzle designs Continuous Coaxial nozzles provide the most even spray profile due to their annular profile. This is at the cost of a reduction in spray focusing. In this paper, the authors use full factorial analysis of simulated gas-powder nozzle flows to determine the impact of inlet pressure (1–10 kPa), powder inlet angle (0° – 25°), powder inlet offset (0–10 mm offset from the centerline), and internal groove shape (no grooves, straight grooves, tapered grooves) on nozzle focusing and powder velocity. It was determined that 1 mm wide straight grooves provided the best focusing, with powder concentrations reaching from 0.3 to 0.45 kg/m3 and particle cloud diameters reaching as low as 6 mm. CFD simulations showed that straight grooves drastically reduce tangential particle velocity components, forcing powders to point towards the nozzle's focal point. A second batch of designs with a smaller nozzle angle (from 17° to 12°) focused on examining other groove geometries, including wider straight grooves and helical grooves. These simulations confirmed that narrow, straight grooves with uniform thickness provide improved powder focusing by controlling powder exit trajectories. In addition, helical grooves with steeper helical angles reduced the powder spray divergence. Finally, one control and the two best performing designs from each batch were manufactured and tested in a lab setting to experimentally observe the overall spray profile. Both the simulations and experiments showed an improvement in nozzle focusing with the addition of straight nozzle grooves, with experimental results showing a 17–18 % decrease in the spray width compared to the control nozzle. © 2022","Additive manufacturing;

In this study, a 3D heat transfer and fluid flow model coupled with the volume-of-fluid algorithm for free surface tracking is developed for the simulation of molten pool dynamics in high-power laser beam welding. The underlying laser-material interactions, i.e., the multiple reflections and Fresnel absorption, are considered by a ray-Tracing method. Two strategies of free surface reconstruction used in the ray-Tracing method are investigated: A typical piecewise linear interface calculation (PLIC)-based method and a novel localized level-set method. The PLIC-based method is discrete, resulting in non-continuous free surface reconstruction. In the localized level-set method, a continuous free surface is reconstructed, and, thus, the exact reflection points can be determined. The calculated spatial laser energy distribution and the corresponding molten pool dynamics from the two methods are analyzed and compared. The obtained numerical results are evaluated with experimental measurements to assure the validity of the proposed model. It is found that distinct patterns of the beam multiple reflections are obtained with the different free surface reconstructions, which shows significant influence not only on the molten pool behaviors but also on the localized keyhole dynamics.  © 2022 Author(s).","Laser beam welding; Laser energy distribution; Ray tracing; Weld pool dynamics","Drop breakup; Flow of fluids; Heat transfer; Laser beam welding; Laser beams; Laser materials processing; Level measurement; Piecewise linear techniques; Ray tracing; Surface reconstruction; Three dimensional computer graphics; Free surfaces; High power laser beam welding; Laser energy distribution; Molten pool; Multiple reflections; Piecewise linear interface calculations; Ray-tracing method; Surfaces reconstruction; Weld pool; Weld pool dynamic; Numerical methods","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (416014189)","This work is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)—Project No. 416014189.","Rethmeier M., Gumenyuk A., Bachmann M., High-power laser beam welding for thick section steels-New perspectives using electromagnetic systems, Sci.

The interaction between the reinforcement phase and the matrix has a major impact on the micro and macroscopic properties of these materials. This interaction is fostered by the exposition of the materials to high temperatures. Hence, it is highly influenced by the thermal cycle of the manufacturing process. In this work, an experimental approach is adopted to determine the influence of the main process parameters on the properties of metal-matrix composites. Statistical regression models are employed to consider the role of the most relevant parameters, from exploration to exploitation. The obtained trends are further corroborated by the corresponding microstructural, SEM, and EDS analyses. In terms of surface hardness, the DOE reveals different trends of the response depending on the composition of the feedstock employed. It is concluded that the strengthening behaviour of the material varies throughout the experimental domain studied. When high WC% feedstocks are employed, the main strengthening mechanism responsible for the increase of hardness is the solid-solution of tungsten and carbide precipitation. On the contrary, when low WC%s are employed, grain refinement becomes the main strengthening mechanism. © 2022 The Authors","Cobalt-base alloy; Diffusion; Metal Matrix Composites; Multi-material L-DED; Tungsten carbide; Wear-resistant coating","Cobalt alloys; Composite coatings; Deposition; Feedstocks; Grain refinement; Hardness; Metallic matrix composites; Metals; Powder metals; Regression analysis; Strengthening (metal); Tungsten alloys; Wear resistance; Cobalt base alloys; Directed energy; Energy depositions; Matrix composite; Metal matrix; Metal matrix composite; Multi materials; Multi-material L-DED; Strengthening mechanisms; Wear-resistant coating; Tungsten carbide","","","","","Eusko Jaurlaritza, (KK-2021/00120); Eusko Jaurlaritza; Tampereen Yliopisto, UTA; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (PDC2021-121042-I00 EHU-Coax, PID2019-109220RB-I00); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN; Business Finland, (4056/31/2021); Business Finland","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Basque Government (Eusko Jaurlaritza) [grant number KK-2021/00120 Imagine]; the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [grant numbers PID2019-109220RB-I00 ALASURF, PDC2021-121042-I00 EHU-Coax]; and Business Finland [grant number TANDEM (4056/31/2021)]. ; Funding text 2: This work made use of the Tampere Microscopy Center facilities at Tampere University.

However, the prevalent laser-based AM technologies possess high energy and investment consumption, and relatively low manufacturing speed, hampering their widespread adoption in building metal lattice components. In this study, an integrated approach of material extrusion AM, debinding, and sintering was introduced to produce 17–4 PH stainless steel plate-lattice structures in a time-efficient and cost-effective way. Three types of plate-lattice structures, namely body-centered cubic (BCC), face-centered cubic (FCC) and their combination (BCC-FCC), were successfully fabricated. Physical-mechanical behaviors, including physical deformation and compressive properties, were investigated through modeling, simulation, and experiments. Specifically, the shrinkage of the final sintered parts was predicted by the analytical modeling and characterized by experimental observation, the results of which showed a good consistency. The plate-lattice structure exhibited equiaxed grains on each surface, with a small portion of lath martensite observed at the top surface. Numerical simulation and compression test were conducted to reveal the compressive modulus, yield strength, and the fractural response at large compressive strains. All three types of plate-lattices possessed a lower compressive modulus than the simulated value, but still exhibited extraordinary yield strength under the compressive force compared to the truss-based or triply periodic minimal surface lattices. The successfully built metal plate-lattice structure verifies the great potential of material extrusion AM process, showing a great promise to fabricate complex metal lattice for large scale applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Compressive properties; Material extrusion; Plate-lattice; Sintering","3D printers; Additives; Compression testing; Compressive strength; Cost effectiveness; Crystal structure; Extrusion; Investments; Metals; Plate metal; Plates (structural components); Powder metals; Stainless steel; Textures; Yield stress; Additive manufacturing technology; Body-centred cubic; Compressive properties; Face-centred cubic; Lattice structures; Material extrusion; Mechanical behavior; Metal lattices; Plate-lattice; Stainless steel plate; Sintering","","","","","State University of New York, SUNY, (ADLG222); Empire State Development's Division of Science, Technology and Innovation, NYSTAR","This work has been supported by the start-up funds from Thomas J.

The FMI 3.0 standard supports two kinds of clock-based simulations: Synchronous Clocked Simulation to ensure predictable systems scheduling with multiple simultaneous events and scheduled execution to facilitate real-time simulations comprising multiple black-box models by allowing fine-grained control over the computation time of submodels. The formalization is a basis for developing tools for orchestrating, verifying and validating the composition of multiple FMUs.

The effect of forming accuracy and compositional homogeneity of the bypass current Cu-Ni structure was first verified by controlled experiments. The effect of Ni content on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Cu-Ni gradient structures fabricated using bypass current was then investigated, with a focus on grain orientation and texture analysis of the three intermediate Cu-Ni mixed gradient layers. The results showed that the use of bypass current in the additive manufacturing of Cu-Ni gradient structures can improve the forming accuracy and effectively eliminate lateral composition deviations within the gradient layers. In the Cu-Ni mixed gradient layers, the average grain size of the gradient layers decreased with increasing nickel content, and unusually large secondary grains appeared in different gradient layers. Due to the different Ni content, different degrees of amplitude modulation decomposition occurred in different gradient layers, resulting in changes of grain orientation and texture composition. Under the combined effects of solid solution strengthening, fine grain strengthening and amplitude modulation decomposition, the microhardness and tensile strength increased with increasing nickel content and then decreased, reaching a maximum near the side of the gradient composition biased toward nickel. The fracture analysis showed a transition from ductility to quasi-fracture. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Bypass-current PAW; Cu/Ni graded materials; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Texture; Wire arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Amplitude modulation; Binary alloys; Copper alloys; Fabrication; Tensile strength; Textures; Thin walled structures; Bypass current; Bypass-current PAW; Cu/ni graded material; Forming accuracy; Graded materials; Gradient layers; Gradient structure; Ni content; Wire arc; Wire arc additive manufacturing; Nickel alloys","","","","","State Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Underwater; Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China, MIIT, ([2019]360); State Key Laboratory of Advanced Welding and Joining, SKLAWJ","Funding text 1: The authors are greatly indebted to the State Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Underwater Vehicle for the support on this research and the State Key Laboratory of Advanced Welding Production Technology for the tests and analyses conducted in this research.

In this research, off-cuts of basalt fibre and recycled mushroom trays made of Polypropylene (PP) have been collected, recycled and combined in an extruder to make short fibre reinforced filaments as material extrusion feedstock filament material. A Noztek Touch Dual PID filament maker was utilized to make reinforced PP with 0%, 2%, 5%, and 8% basalt fibre weight fractions. The extruding parameters including motor speed, heating temperatures, cooling fan status, extrusion tension have been optimized to produce a filament made from these waste materials with the desired surface quality, void content, and profile. Microscopic assessment has been carried out to verify the fibre dispersion and above mentioned quality measures in the upcycled filaments. Differential scanning calorimetry has been done to measure the melting and crystallization temperatures of collected polypropylene and recycled filaments, and the tensile strength and elastic modulus of the reinforced recycled polypropylene have been measured in presence of different percentages of short basalt fibres with 4.5 mm length. The produced filaments with 5% wt. of basalt are a good candidate for use as feedstock in manufacturing using 3D printing. © 2022 The Author(s)","3D printing; Composite; Filament; Recycling","3D printers; Basalt; Differential scanning calorimetry; Extrusion; Feedstocks; Fibers; Plastic recycling; Reinforced plastics; Tensile strength; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Basalt fiber; Fibre-reinforced; Filament; Manufacturing methods; Polypropylene filaments; Recycled plastics; Recycled polypropylene; Recycling; Polypropylenes","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Horizon 2020; ; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (847402); H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA","Funding text 1: This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie grant agreement No. 847402.; Funding text 2: This project has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie grant agreement No. 847402.","Berman B., 3-D printing: The new industrial revolution, Bus.

The first part of the paper focuses on the selection of suitable variants for the robotic vehicle arrangement, i.e., frame, electric motors with gearboxes, wheels, steering and accumulators. Based on the selection of individual components, the robotic vehicle was built. An important part of the robotic vehicle was the design of the suspension of the front wheels. The resulting shape of the springs was experimentally developed from several design variants and subsequently produced by an additive manufacturing process. The last part of article is devoted to the experimental measurement of the acceleration transfer to the upper part of the frame during the passage of the robotic vehicle over differently arranged obstacles. Experimental measurements measured the accelerations that are transferred to the top of the robotic vehicle frame when the front wheels of the vehicle cross over the obstacle (obstacles). The maximum acceleration values are 0.0588 m/s2 in the x-axis, 0.0149 m/s2 in the y-axis and 0.5755 m/s2 in the z-axis. This experimental solution verifies the stiffness of the designed frame and the damping effect of the selected material of the designed springs on the front wheels of the robotic vehicle. © 2022 by the authors.","accumulators; electric motors; robotic vehicle; steering; vibration","Automobile steering equipment; Robotics; Traction motors; Vehicle wheels; Vibrations (mechanical); Accumulator; Additive manufacturing process; Design and construction; Front wheels; Individual components; Measurements of; Robotic vehicles; Vehicle frame; Vibration; Wheel steering; acceleration; article; rigidity; spring; suspension; three dimensional printing; vibration; Steering","","","","","Internal Grant Agency of Jan Evangelista Purkyne University in Usti nad Labem, (UJEP-IGA-JR-2021-48-003-2)","This work was supported by the Internal Grant Agency of Jan Evangelista Purkyne University in Usti nad Labem, Czech Republic, grant number UJEP-IGA-JR-2021-48-003-2.","Martinez-Gutierrez A., Diez-Gonzalez J., Ferrero-Guillen R., Verde P., Alvarez R., Perez H., Digital Twin for Automatic Transportation in Industry 4.0, Sensors, 21, (2021); Santos J., Rebelo P.M., Rocha L.F., Costa P., Veiga G., A* Based Routing and Scheduling Modules for Multiple AGVs in an Industrial Scenario, Robotics, 10, (2021); Kala R., Warwick K., Motion Planning of Autonomous Vehicles in a Non-Autonomous Vehicle Environment without Speed Lanes, Eng.

In this work, an equiatomic CoCrNi medium-entropy alloy (MEA) was used as a novel binder to fabricate W–CoCrNi composites through laser metal deposition (LMD) technique. The microstructural features and corresponding mechanical properties were systematically investigated by changing the contents of CoCrNi binders. The intrinsic fast melting and high cooling rate followed by the cyclic thermal treatment during the additive manufacturing process induced a hierarchical microstructure: tens of micro-sized un-melted W particles were uniformly distributed in the CoCrNi matrix, while those partially melted W form supersaturate solid solution in the matrix with a W concentration of ∼20 wt% and finely dispersed Co7W6 precipitates. With the increasing of CoCrNi, the morphology of Co7W6 precipitates changes from coarse short rods into fine dendrites, which results in substantial increase in compression strain. The W-based composite shows an excellent combination of compression yield strength over 1300 MPa and strain of 60% at room temperature. The high strength derives from the capability of blocking dislocation motions by W particles and Co7W6 precipitates, while the large plastic strain originates from the intrinsic high work hardening rate of CoCrNi MEA. The findings in this work provide an avenue for the design of refractory materials with high strength and high deformability by taking advantage of MEA binders. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing;

However, realistic load scenarios usually exhibit more general stress distributions. This study employs local member analyses to estimate the buckling strength surface of stretch-dominated lattice structures. As an integral part of the method, the yield strength surface is also determined. Local members are analyzed under different boundary conditions, i.e., simply-supported, clamped as well as rotational springs accounting for lattice topologies. The local member estimations are compared with accurate but expensive numerical linear microstructural buckling analyses for different loadings. The local member approach provides a valuable tool to quickly estimate the microstructural buckling strength of stretch-dominated lattice structures, especially for applications where the stress state is non-uniform such as infill in additive manufacturing. Using the local member approach, we compute the entire buckling strength surfaces of an orthotropic bulk modulus optimal plate, an isotropic stiffness optimal plate, and an isotropic truss lattice structure subjected to rotated uni-axial loads. All the considered lattice structures possess high buckling strength anisotropy. In addition, the isotropic stiffness optimal plate structure possesses a near-isotropic yield strength surface while the truss counterpart possesses an anisotropic one. Inspired by the buckling strength surface calculations, we further propose a new isotropic plate lattice configuration with enhanced buckling strength isotropy without stiffness or yield strength deterioration. © 2022","Architected materials; Buckling strength surfaces; Microstructural buckling; Yield strength surfaces","Anisotropy; Deterioration; Orthotropic plates; Stiffness; Structural optimization; Trusses; Yield stress; Architected material; Buckling strength; Buckling strength surface; Isotropics; Lattice structures; Micro-structural; Microstructural buckling; Strength surface; Yield strength surface; Buckling","","","","","Villum Fonden","We acknowledge the financial support from the Villum Foundation through the Villum Investigator Project InnoTop .","Andersen M.N., Wang F., Sigmund O., On the competition for ultimately stiff and strong architected materials, Mater.

There is a significant effect on user-to-user, user-to-server, server-to-user, and other forms of inter-communication due to the LWE. The researcher employs many cryptographic techniques, including encryption, decryption, signcryption, and digital signature, to heighten the effect of information security in LWE scenarios. The challenging task of the proposed techniques, such as RSA, Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP), Elliptic Curves (EC), etc., is unsuitable for LWE. Due to the large key size, it does not provide an efficient solution in terms of computation and communication costs. Therefore, the researchers use the concept of the Hyper Elliptic Curve (HEC), which is more suitable for LWE. In this paper, we analyze the concept of HEC for resource-constrained environments. The HEC perspective trend is used to ensure the maintenance of the security of LWE and to provide effective performance in computation and communication overheads. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Digital signature; Discrete Logarithm Problem; Encryption; Hyper elliptic curves; Hyper elliptic curves cryptography; Low Constrained Environments; Signcryption","Authentication; Electronic document identification systems; Geometry; Curve cryptography; Discrete logarithms problems; Electronics devices; Hyper elliptic curve cryptography; Hyper-elliptic curves; Hyperelliptic curve cryptosystems; Low constrained environment; Signcryption; Smart phones; Cryptography","","","","","","","Scholten J., Vercauteren F., An introduction to elliptic and hyperelliptic curve cryptography and the NTRU cryptosystem, State of the art in applied cryptography, COSIC, Vol. 3, (2003); Eschenauer L., Gligor V.D., A key-management scheme for distributed sensor networks, Proceedings of the 9th ACM conference on computer and communications security, pp. 41-47, (2002); Landstra T., Zawodniok M., Jagannathan S., Energy-efficient hybrid key management protocol for wireless sensor networks, 32nd IEEE conference on local computer networks (LCN 2007), pp. 1009-1016, (2007); Watro R., Kong D., Cuti S.-F., Gardiner C., Lynn C., Kruus P., TinyPK: securing sensor networks with public key technology, Proceedings of the 2nd ACM workshop on security of ad hoc and sensor networks, pp. 59-64, (2004); Chatterjee K., De A., Gupta D., Mutual authentication protocol using hyperelliptic curve cryptosystem in constrained devices, IJ Netw Secur, 15, 1, pp. 9-15, (2013); Koblitz N., Hyperelliptic cryptosystems, J Cryptol, 1, 3, pp. 139-150, (1989); Fernandez-Valencia R., Undeniable signatures based on isogenies of supersingular hyperelliptic curves, (2019); Yi X.-L., Zhou W., Zhao L., Jin Y.-Y., A proxy signature scheme based on hyperelliptic curve, J Beijing Univ Technol, 8, (2009); Cohen H., Frey G., Avanzi R., Doche C., Lange T., Nguyen K., Vercauteren F., Handbook of elliptic and hyperelliptic curve cryptography, (2005); Gaudry P., Integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems, Les Cours CIRM, 4, 1, pp. 1-20, (2014); Rivest R.L., RSA problem, pp. 1-10, (2004); Tahat N., Abdallah E.E., A new signing algorithm based on elliptic curve discrete logarithms and quadratic residue problems, Ital J Pure Appl Math, 32, 1, pp. 125-132, (2014); Lauter K.E., Stange K.E., The elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem and equivalent hard problems for elliptic divisibility sequences, Selected areas in cryptography, pp. 309-327, (2009); Xiangjun X., Hailiang S., Digital signature scheme based on the inverse bilinear pairing operation problem, 2009 WASE international conference on information engineering, Vol. 2, pp. 225-228, (2009); Tran C., Formulae for computation of tate pairing on hyperelliptic curve using hyperelliptic nets, International conference on cryptology in Africa, pp. 199-214, (2014); Bertoni G., Breveglieri L., Wollinger T., Paar C., Finding optimum parallel coprocessor design for genus 2 hyperelliptic curve cryptosystems, International conference on information technology: Coding and computing, 2004.

However, existing research reveals no golden standard for identifying suitable part candidates for AM and mainly combines preexisting methods that lack conceptual underpinnings. As a result, the identification approaches are not adjusted to organizations and are not completely operationalizable. Our first contribution is to investigate and map the existing literature from the perspective of knowledge management (KM). The second contribution is to develop and empirically investigate a combined part-identification approach in a defense sector case study. The part identification entailed an analytical hierarchy process (AHP), semi-structured interviews, and workshops. In the first run, we screened 35,000 existing aftermarket and legacy parts. Similar to previous research, the approach was not in sync with the organization. However, in contrast to previous research, we infuse part identification with KM theory by developing and testing a “Phase 0” assessment that ensures an operational fit between the approach and the organization. We tested Phase 0 and the knowledge management-based approach in a second run, which is the main contribution of this study. This paper contributes empirical research that moves beyond previous research by demonstrating how to overcome the present challenges of part identification and outlines how knowledge management-based part identification integrates with current operations and supply chains.

Modern applications include the repair of existing components and additive manufacturing. The main advantages of DED are high deposition rates and low energy input. However, the process is influenced by a variety of parameters affecting the component quality. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) offer the possibility of mapping complex processes such as DED. They can serve as a tool for predicting optimal process parameters and quality characteristics. Previous research only refers to weld beads: a transferability to additively manufactured three-dimensional components has not been investigated. In the context of this work, an ANN is generated based on 86 weld beads. Quality categories (poor, medium, and good) are chosen as target variables to combine several quality features. The applicability of this categorization compared to conventional characteristics is discussed in detail. The ANN predicts the quality category of weld beads with an average accuracy of 81.5%. Two randomly generated parameter sets predicted as ""good""by the network are then used to build tracks, coatings, walls, and cubes. It is shown that ANN trained with weld beads are suitable for complex parameter predictions in a limited way.  © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","additive manufacturing; artificial neural network; DED; quality assurance; welding parameter","3D printers; Additives; Coatings; Complex networks; Deposition rates; Neural networks; Welding; Welds; 3D geometry; Coating process; Directed energy; Directed energy deposition; Energy depositions; Industrial use; Modern applications; Parameter set; Weld bead; Welding parameters; Quality assurance","","","","","German Welding Association; German federal ministry for economic airs and energy; Deutscher Verband für Schweißen, DVS; Allianz Industrie Forschung, AiF; Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie, BMWi","Research funding: This research was funded by the German federal ministry for economic airs and energy (BMWi) through the industrial cooperative research association (AiF) and the German Welding Association (DVS) under the project entitled “Certify as you build – Quality assurance for the directed energy deposition” with grant number of IGF 20.612 N.

For heterogeneous tissue development, the printing approaches permitting controllable deposition of multicellular components in a flexible manner are urgently needed. Here, a facile dot-extrusion printing (DEP) system for one-step generation of cell-laden gelatin methacrylate (GelMa) hydrogel beads (GHBs) is developed, which allows size-tunable GHBs programmable positioned into complex 3D constructs. The GelMa is in situ semi-gelled at the printhead, thus enabling one-step generation of GHBs onto the platform, as a result of improved printing simplicity, fidelity and flexibility. The size and spatial position of the GHBs are adjustable by programming G-code parameters. Further, by integrating multiple printheads, GHBs encapsulating different cellular components can be printed to fabricate heterogeneous tissue constructs, and maintain the post-printed cell viability over 95%. As an example of application, two different tumor-stroma spatial phases were developed through spatial regionally printing tumor cells and normal fibroblasts into juxtapositional or overlapping microcapsule structures, giving an access to study the complex tumor-stroma interactions in different microenvironments. The developed DEP system thus holds promise for creation of complex and heterogeneous tissues toward various biology studies. © 2022 The Authors","3D tumor constructs; Dot extrusion bioprinting; Hydrogel beads; Tumor invasion; Tumor-stroma interaction","Cell culture; Cell engineering; Cells; Extrusion; Hydrogels; Tissue engineering; 3d tumor construct; Bioprinting; Dot extrusion bioprinting; Heterogeneous tissues; Hydrogel beads; Print head; Printing system; Tumor invasion; Tumor models; Tumor-stroma interactions; Tumors","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (31927801); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31927801).

In this respect, surface unevenness of parts deposited by WAAM has always been a pressing issue. The improvement of surface unevenness depends on the multi-bead overlapping model. However, due to the asymmetric deposition environment and obstruction of the previous bead, the traditional overlapping model hardly achieves a relatively flat surface. In this study, the gap-filling overlapping model (GOM) based on the alternate overlapping strategy was proposed for WAAM. Based on the principle of equal volume, the model does not need curve fitting and significantly simplifies the calculation process of its mathematical model. Single-bead experiments were performed to capture the shapes of beads. According to two calculation strategies, three-bead experiments were conducted to verify the correctness of the proposed GOM. Five-bead experiments were conducted to compare the GOM and the alternated overlapping model (AOM). The results show the effectiveness of the GOM in various cross-section profiles of beads. The five-bead sample deposited by the GOM achieves better surface flatness and a larger effective area than the AOM. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Gap-filling overlapping model; Multi-bead; Surface unevenness; Wire and arc additive manufacturing","Additives; Curve fitting; Filling; Wire; Flatter surfaces; Gap filling; Gap-filling overlapping model; Manufacturing IS; Metallic component; Model-based OPC; Multi beads; Pressung; Surface unevenness; Wire and arc additive manufacturing; 3D printers","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai, (20ZR1422600); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai (grant no. 20ZR1422600).

The growing popularity of cloud computing has raised power usage and network costs. Frequent calls for computational resources may cause system instability; further, load balancing in the host requires migrating virtual machines (VM) from overloaded to underloaded hosts, which affects energy usage. The proposed cost-efficient whale optimization algorithm for virtual machine (CEWOAVM) technique helps to more effectively place migrating virtual machines. CEWOAVM optimizes system resources such as CPU, storage, and memory. This study proposes energy-aware virtual machine migration with the use of the WOA algorithm for dynamic, cost-effective cloud data centers in order to solve this problem. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm saved 18.6%, 27.08%, and 36.3% energy when compared with the PSOCM, RAPSO-VMP, and DTH-MF algorithms, respectively. It also showed 12.68%, 18.7%, and 27.9% improvements for the number of virtual machine migrations and 14.4%, 17.8%, and 23.8% reduction in SLA violation, respectively. © 2022 by the authors.","cloud computing; migration; SLA; virtual machine; WOA","","","","","","","","Garg H., A hybrid PSO-GA algorithm for constrained optimization problems, Appl.

While the usage of these structures was met with some success, the results were not optimal due to factors such as lack of localized porosity control and stress concentration at nodes of gradient scaffolds. This led to a push for novel designs, such as, stochastic scaffolds with locally tunable porosity as well as anisotropically varying mechanical properties. A number of methods exist for generating these stochastic structures, such as, random set method, stochastic optimization method, iterative non-linear transformative method and others, but while these techniques led to a greater approximation of the bone microstructure, they did not help in the creation of a structure with controlled modulus along different directions. The novelty of the method used in this paper is that it not only helps in generating stochastic structures in a computationally inexpensive and non-complex way, but also generates a porosity gradient along three different axes in a controlled manner. Various additive manufacturing techniques have been successfully utilized for fabricating these structures at different scales, using different materials, thus, proving their versatility. The proposed design approach was implemented in the case of a 3D reconstructed rabbit model. Magics software was used to extract the internal microstructure of the rabbit model and our design approach was used for generating a stochastic scaffold which accurately mimicked the porosity gradient of the rabbit model in all the three directions. On comparing the mechanical properties of the rabbit microstructure and the gradient mimicking scaffold, the variations were significant as the properties depend not only on the porosity gradient but also on the internal microstructure, which warrants further multi-property optimization. © 2022 The Authors","3D printing, biomimetic; Bone tissue engineering; Functionally gradient; Stochastic scaffolds; TPMS","Biomechanics; Biomimetics; Honeycomb structures; Iterative methods; Microstructure; Optimization; Porosity; Scaffolds (biology); Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Structural properties; Tissue; 3-D printing; 3d printing, biomimetic; 3D-printing; Bone tissue engineering; Functionally gradient; Porosity gradients; Rabbit models; Stochastic scaffold; Stochastics; Triply periodic minimal surfaces; 3D printers","","","","","New York University Abu Dhabi","This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.

For the optimization design of fiber-reinforced composite, two key issues are the description of spatially varying fiber angles and the mathematical representation of the manufacturing constraints. A novel parameterization scheme based on the compactly supported radial basis functions (CS-RBFs) is established to describe the spatially varying fiber angle vector field. Its main characters, including the nonnegativity, partition of unity, and differentiability, inherently ensure the fiber continuity, the bounds of the design variables and make it compatible with the gradient-based optimization design algorithm. Besides, a mathematical formulation is developed to construct the relationships between two common manufacturing constraints (minimum turning radius and gap/overlap) and the curl and divergence of the vector field. By the proposed parameterization scheme and p-norm aggregation function, these manufacturing constraints can be easily described in all elements and added to the optimization. Several numerical examples are conducted to investigate the influence of the varying support points, the radius of the CS-RBFs, initial design, load condition, norm parameter and the excitation frequency on the final design. The optimized results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Design optimization; Fiber-reinforced composite; Manufacturing constraints; P-norm; Radial basis function","Fiber reinforced plastics;

A spatially varying representative grain texture and morphology are incorporated in a representative volume element having the size of a single fusion zone and which is generated using a 3D anisotropic Voronoi algorithm. The constitutive behavior is modeled at the grain scale by a finite element crystal plasticity framework, of which the corresponding parameters are obtained from experimental tensile tests in one of the processing directions. As a result of the spatially correlated grain orientations inside the fusion zone, distinct deformation patterns and strain localizations have been observed during experimental tensile tests. The strain fields obtained from numerical simulations are compared to the experimental deformation patterns and a remarkable correspondence is observed. Numerical simulations are also performed in various uniaxial loading directions to predict the 3D yield behavior. A strongly anisotropic plastic response is obtained and a convincing match between the numerical model and experimental tensile tests is found in various loading directions. © 2022 The Author(s)","316L stainless steel; Crystal plasticity; Experimental characterization; Microstructural modeling; Wire + arc additive manufacturing; Yield stress anisotropy","3D modeling; Additives; Anisotropy; Austenitic stainless steel; Deformation; Numerical models; Plasticity; Tensile testing; Textures; Yield stress; 316 L stainless steel; Crystal plasticity; Deformation pattern; Experimental characterization; Fusion zones; Microstructural models; Stress anisotropy; Wire + arc additive manufacturing; Wire arc; Yield stress anisotropy; 3D printers","","","","","Rotterdam Fieldlab Additive Manufacturing BV; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO; Materials innovation institute, M2i","Funding text 1: This research was carried out under project number P16-46/S17 024e, which is part of the AiM2XL program, in the framework of the Partnership Program of the Materials innovation institute M2i (www.m2i.nl) and the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (www.nwo.nl).

For this purpose, different mix compositions including 0%, 1%, and 3% RSF content in terms of volume were proposed. Self-compacting ability was assessed using mini-cone tests, while nondestructive testing has been used to evaluate the effect of RSF inclusion on the compaction of UHPSCM constituent materials. Mechanical performances were investigated using compression and unnotched flexural tests. Residual flexural strength in both service limit state (SLS), ultimate limit state (ULS), and two equivalent flexural strengths were evaluated under notched flexural tests and analysed using statistical approaches. Concrete Damage Plasticity (CDP) has been employed for the analysis behaviour of developed mortars under different loadings. Additionally, an element deletion approach was used to evaluate the fracture of UHPSCM under compression and flexural loadings. The experimental results showed that adding 1% and 3% of RSF resulted in decreasing workability by 3% and 22%, respectively. Improving compressive strength by 16% and 22% and flexural by 7% and 8% were noticed in the case of samples with 1% and 3% fiber, respectively, in 28 days. In spite of the significant improvement of post-cracking behaviour of samples with 3% of RSF, this behaviour was insignificant for the samples with 1% of RSF. However, with less amount of fibre inclusion, brittle failure can be altered to ductile failure. Moreover, the behaviour of the tested specimens under different loadings was successfully predicted using Finite Element (FE) simulations.

However, limitations, including low build volume capability and production rate, yield its rapid application in high volume production. This paper presents the potential of remote laser welding (RLW) as a post-AM joining approach to scale up the AM components. The AM AlSi10Mg alloy was fabricated by direct metal laser sintering and subsequently joined by RLW without filler wire or shielding gas. A novel adjustable ring mode (ARM) laser beam was employed during the RLW process where the ring beam is designed to stabilize the keyhole by providing the preheating and postheating while the core beam guarantees a sufficient weld penetration. The impact of the ARM laser on weld porosity was evaluated in both fillet lap and bead-on-plate welding configurations, accompanied by the variation of core/ring beam power ratios. Crack-free welds with promising weld appearance were obtained among all welding trials, indicating that the ARM-RLW process can be employed for the robust connection of AM AlSi10Mg alloys. Optimizing the power ratio can substantially reduce the weld porosity area ratio from 24.3% to 13.5% in the fillet lap configuration and from 24.2% to 14.4% in the bead-on-plate configuration. Analysis of variance tests statistically confirmed the significant impact of the power ratio on the porosity area ratio. Future work has been suggested for the process maturation of RLW as a post-AM joining approach in industrial application.  © 2022 Author(s).","","Additives; Joining; Laser beam welding; Laser beams; Laser heating; Porosity; Sintering; Welds; Area ratios; Bead on plate; Innovative manufacturing; Manufacturing IS; Power ratio; Remote laser welding; Ring beams; Ring modes; Weld porosity; Welding process; 3D printers","","","","","WMG Centre High Value Manufacturing Catapult and Innovate UK FASA; Higher Education Funding Council for England, HEFCE","This work was partially supported by WMG Centre High Value Manufacturing Catapult and Innovate UK FASA: Flexible, Automated Stator Assembly.

The key elements of the reactor and fuel design differ somewhat to those seen in Light Water Reactors (LWRs), most markedly the cladding, an austenitic stainless steel, and annular ceramic UO2 fuel pellets. The graphite moderated AGR cores also experience much higher temperatures than PWR (Pressurised water reactor) cores. In order to fully understand the requirements for enhanced fuel performance and interim/long term spent fuel storage, some efforts must be made to compare and contrast the two fuel types, to understand if LWR data are fully applicable to AGR data in various operational and storage scenarios. One such microstructural effect requiring assessment is a fuel microstructure commonly referred to as high burnup structure (HBS). The current study describes a series of post-irradiation examinations (PIE) undertaken on AGR fuel. A total of circa 30 AGR samples are examined in which HBS is present, and a further similar size of samples in which no HBS was present. Observations include SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and LOM (light optical microscopy) providing a characterisation of the appearance of HBS in AGR. The results are supported by burnup profile modelling, and assessment of fuel temperature from metallographic markers. The results are consistent with AGR outer ring fuel exhibiting an onset of HBS at a rod average burnup of ∼30 MWd/kgU and a 100 μm HBS thickness at a rod average burnup of 40 MWd/kgU. These values are lower than the comparable (pellet average) burnup for PWR fuel. The difference in burnup is shown to be due to the neutron spectrum in AGR fuel elements, and which also leads to a marked variation in HBS thickness around the circumference of AGR fuel. There is no suggestion that the local onset burnup for HBS formation differs between the two fuel types. © 2022","","Fuel storage; Gas cooled reactors; Gas plants; Light water reactors; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Pelletizing; Pressurized water reactors; Scanning electron microscopy; Uranium dioxide; Burn up; Fuel design; Fuel types; Gas-cooled reactors; Graphite-moderated; High-burnup structure; Key elements; Pressurised water reactor; Reactor designs; Reactor fuels; Digital storage","","","","","BNFL; NNL Science and Technology; EDF Energy","Funding text 1: Most of the LOM metallographic results presented here were obtained as part of the AGR PIE programme funded by EDF Energy and previous operators of the UK AGR reactor fleet.

Hexagonal close-packed arrangements of circular/spherical holes allow defining 2D/3D isotropic/transversely isotropic microstructures whose macroscopic elastic properties depend on the radius of the cavities, namely the density of the porous material. An interpolation law is implemented to handle two-material structures with void, distributing both solid and graded material within a certain density range. An Augmented Lagrangian approach is adopted to handle multiple displacement constraints, along with the enforcement of a minimum amount of graded porous microstructure to be used in the optimal design. The proposed method defines: (i) boundaries of the component, and, (ii) possible internal arrangements of circular/spherical holes with graded radius. Also, when boundaries of a hollow component are prescribed, the method can be used to equip it with an optimal infill. Numerical examples are presented, concerning two- and three- dimensional problems, for different types of loads. Features of the proposed procedure are discussed, as well as peculiar properties of the optimal solutions, with special regard to coated structures. Fabrication of the porous layouts by means of additive manufacturing techniques is outlined. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Close-packing of spheres; Coated structures; Isotropic porous microstructures; Multi-constrained optimization; Multi-scale topology optimization","3D printers; Additives; Lagrange multipliers; Microstructure; Optimal systems; Porous materials; Shape optimization; Topology; Close packing; Close-packing of sphere; Coated structure; Isotropic porous microstructure; Isotropics; Multi-constrained optimization; Multi-scale topology optimization; Multi-scales; Porous microstructure; Scale topologies; Topology optimisation; Constrained optimization","","","","","Nemzeti Kutatási Fejlesztési és Innovációs Hivatal, NKFIH, (K 138615)","The first three authors wish to thank the National Research, Development and Innovation Office of Hungary (grant K 138615).

To evaluate the developmental toxicity of antifouling biocides (Diuron, Irgarol 1051, Sea-nine 211) and wastewater (from high-pressure water blasting (WHPB) and its MeOH extract (WHPB-MeOH)) in the copepod Paracalanus parvus sl, we investigated the chemical concentration, egg-hatching rate, and nauplius mortality. WHPB samples were obtained through hull-cleaning activities involving WHPB in a dry dock. Among the biocides, Sea-nine 211 had the strongest effects on hatching rates and nauplius mortality, which was followed by Diuron and Irgarol 1051. In the WHPB and WHPB-MeOH samples, there was no significant difference between the experimental groups in terms of the egg-hatching rate; however, WHPB was found to be more toxic in terms of nauplius mortality, suggesting that metals in WHPB may also adversely affect nauplius survival in P. parvus sl. A comparison of the LC50 results of Sea-nine 211 and WHPB revealed that WHPB had a negative effect on nauplius mortality even at a 100-fold lower concentration. Therefore, if chemical contaminants generated during in-water cleaning activity are discharged continuously into the ports without being properly collected through a post-treatment system, they are expected to negatively impact the population of copepods near the port. Although verification is needed through additional experiments, our results could be used for a baseline study concerning the toxicity of antifouling biocides on marine copepod species. © 2022 by the authors.","antifouling booster biocides; biofouling; dissolved metal; in-water cleaning; invasive species; marine ecosystem","","","","","","Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, MOF; Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology, KIOST, (20210651)","This research was a part of the project titled “A Base Study to Understand and Counteract Marine Ecosystem Change in Korean Waters: Development of Risk Assessment and Management Process for Ship’s Biofouling Debris Discharged from In-water Cleaning (PEA0013),” funded by the Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology (KIOST).

It can result in a poor bead surface, surface oxidation, and spattering. In particular, the relocation of the cathode spot area is the main cause of big spatters because of the high thermal energy of the molten droplet at the molten pool surface. In this study, two cathode spot control techniques were applied using auxiliary laser heating and prelaid oxides, and the behaviors of the cathode spots and arc were visualized using high-speed photography. When the laser beam was irradiated in front of the GMA, a cathode spot was formed at the laser irradiation position, and the cathode jet did not interfere with the arc plasma and droplet transfer from the GMA. However, when the distance between the GMA and the laser irradiation position increased by more than 8 mm, multiple cathode spots were established, and spattering increased. The prelaid Ti oxide particles increased the metal deposition efficiency by establishing multiple and dispersed cathode spots rather than a concentrated cathode spot by droplet impingement. It was found that the volumetric transfer efficiencies (excluding spattering) for the laser-assisted control and Ti oxide powder were up to 99.87% and 91.2%, respectively.  © 2022 Author(s).","","3D printers; Additives; Cathodes; Drops; High speed photography; Irradiation; Laser beams; Titanium oxides; Bead surface; Cathode spot; Critical problems; Gas metal arcs; High thermal; Irradiation position; Surface oxidations; Titania oxides; Titanium (alloys); Wire arc; Titanium alloys","","","","","Korea Institute of Industrial Technology, KITECH, (EO-22-0005); Korea Institute of Industrial Technology, KITECH","We acknowledge the financial support provided by the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology (Grant No. EO-22-0005).","International A.S.M., ASM Handbook, 10th Ed., Vol. 2: Properties and Selection: Nonferrous Alloys and Special-Purpose Materials, (1992); Uhlmann E., Kersting R., Klein T.B., Cruz M.F., Borille A.V., Additive manufacturing of titanium alloy for aircraft components, Proc.

Among the characteristics, the individually effect of morphology on its flowability still is not comprehensively evaluated. In this study, the effect of morphology on the flowability of hydride-dehydrate titanium (HDH Ti) powder treated by high temperature ball milling (HTBM) was investigated systematically using the fractal dimension and shape factors, i.e., circularity, elongation, compactness and convexity. The results of HTBM show that the modified HDH Ti powder with a mass flow rate of 48.1 ± 0.3 s/50 g and the angle of repose (AOR) of 38.88 ± 0.5°. The fractal dimension of powder plays a main role on the flowability, which increase in the decrease of it. The box plot and Pearson correlation coefficient of shape factors indicate that only circularity is strong correlation with flowability, which increases with it. The regression model of flowability expressed with fractal dimension and circularity shows the adjusted R2 value of 0.991, which is good agreement with the experiment. Taken together, this study provides a general guide to evaluate the powder flowability based on the morphology. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Flowability; High temperature ball milling; Hydride-dehydrate titanium; Particle morphology","3D printers; Additives; Compressive strength; Correlation methods; Fractal dimension; Hydrides; Milling (machining); Morphology; Powder metals; Regression analysis; Flowability; High temperature ball milling; Highest temperature; Hydride-dehydrate titania; Particle morphologies; Powder characteristics; Powder flowability; Shapes factors; Titania; Titanium powders; Ball milling","","","","","Postdoctor Research Foundation of Shunde Graduate School of University of Science and Technology Beijing, (2022BH001); State Key Lab of Advanced Metals and Materials; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51874037, 51922004); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2021M700377); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (2212035); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality; University of Science and Technology Beijing, USTB, (2020Z-04, 2021Z-03, FRF-IDRY-20-023); University of Science and Technology Beijing, USTB; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (06500236, FRF-TP-19005C1Z); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2021A1515110548); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","This research work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51922004, 51874037), State Key Lab of Advanced Metals and Materials, University of Science and Technology Beijing (Z-14, 2020Z-04, 2021Z-03), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (FRF-TP-19005C1Z, 06500236), Interdisciplinary Research Project for Young Teachers of USTB (Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, FRF-IDRY-20-023), Postdoctor Research Foundation of Shunde Graduate School of University of Science and Technology Beijing (2022BH001), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2021M700377), Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2021A1515110548) and the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (2212035).","Nagase T., Hori T., Todai M., Sun S.H., Nakano T., Additive manufacturing of dense components in beta-titanium alloys with crystallographic texture from a mixture of pure metallic element powders, Mater.

Investigations of bead-on-plate welds for Ti–6Al–4V were first conducted to identify the process parameters for full penetration welds with a minimum energy input of 37 mA at a traverse speed of 7 mm/s. Vanadium bead on plate welds produced a penetration of approximately 75%, which was enough to proceed onto DW experiments. Defect-free full penetration welds were produced. The DW weld zone microstructure revealed an elongated dendritic structure comprised of bulky βTi grains and a fine substructure of α' laths. Thermal imaging (TI) showed an increment in radiance temperature ahead of the melt pool, indicating that there is a minimum energy required before keyhole welding is present, confirming mathematical calculations. Mechanical characterisation finds a fair range of hardness across both base metals (BM), heat affected zones (HAZ) and fusion zones (FZ). With no yield plateau in tensile test curves, the material is confirmed to fail on the side with lower mechanical properties, i.e., vanadium, which draws a fair process window for dissimilar welding between Ti6Al4V and vanadium alloys. © 2022 The Authors","Design of experiments; Dissimilar welding; Electron beam welding; Microstructure; Thermal imaging; Titanium; Vanadium","","","","","","Henry Royce Institute; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP /L025213/1, EP /P006566/1, EP /R00661X/1); Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, MHESR","The main author (A.M.) would like to thank The Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research of Iraq (MoHESR) for sponsoring his studies during his PhD project.

Los Castros s/n, Santander, 39005, Spain","The growing use of power converters connected to the grid motivates their study in power electronics courses and the prototype development in the degree final project (DFP). However, the practical realization of using state-of-the-art components and conversion techniques is complex due to the numerous multidisciplinary aspects that students must consider in its design and development and the workload associated with the DFP. An example of this is that, unlike a conventional power factor correction (PFC) design, the individual dedication of students to complete the design and validation of modern bridgeless PFC stages exceeds the number of credits of the DFP. The reason for this is that it includes system modeling, becoming familiar with the devices used, discrete selection, circuit design, control development, and programming, to build the converter and verify the operation of the complete system. To reinforce the individual skills needed for the DFP and reduce this time, a novel strategy is proposed. It allows the student to focus their efforts on integrating the individual skills achieved in the degree at the appropriate competence level during the modeling and construction of the power converter while carrying out part of the tasks out of the lab, if necessary, as was the case during the pandemic restrictions. For this, the rapid prototyping technique is introduced to speed up the overall design and speed up the tuning of digital controllers. This manuscript presents a teaching experience in which students build digitally controlled power converters using Texas Instruments microcontroller boards and PLECS®. The example of a bridgeless totem-pole power factor corrector is shown. Although it began to develop and was motivated due to the restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, the experience has been verified and is maintained over time, successfully consolidating. © 2022 by the authors.","digital control; grid connected converter; power converter; power electronics; power factor corrector; rapid prototyping; teaching experience","","","","","","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (PID2021-128941OB-I00)","This research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation under Project PID2021-128941OB-I00 TRENTI–Efficient Energy Transformation in Industrial Environments.","Crow M., Making the graduate-industry connection, IEEE Power Energy Mag, 3, pp. 34-37, (2005); Olvera M.M., Velazquez A.L.F., Castellanos A.T., Assessment of Competencies Required for Society 5.0 for Engineering Graduates, IEEE Rev.

The filament is an amorphous polymer matrix (PEI) reinforced with elastic short glass fibers treated as a single polymer composite (SPC) holding the assumption of thermo-rheologically simple matrix. Effective thermo-viscoelastic behavior is obtained by implementing mean-field homogenization schemes through the extension of the correspondence principle to continuous variations of temperature by using the time–temperature superposition principle and the internal time technique. The state of the fibers in the composite is described through the use of probability distribution functions. Explicit forms of the effective properties are obtained from an identification step, ensuring the same mathematical structure as the matrix behavior. The benchmark simulations are predictions of residual stress resulting from the cooling of the representative elementary volumes (REVs) characterizing the composite filament. The computation of the averaged stress in the benchmarking examples is achieved by solving numerically the stress–strain problem via the internal variables’ framework. Reference solutions are obtained from Fast Fourier Transform based full-field homogenization simulations. A comparative analysis is performed, showing the reliability of the proposed homogenization procedure to predict residual stress against extensive computations of the macroscopic behavior of a given microstructure. © 2022","Analytical homogenization; Full-field FFT homogenization; Reinforced polymers; Thermo-viscoelasticity","3D printers; Additives; Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Distribution functions; Fast Fourier transforms; Fibers; Polymer matrix composites; Residual stresses; Analytical homogenization; Fibre-reinforced; Full-field FFT homogenization; High-temperature fibers; matrix; Reinforced polymers; Simple++; Thermo-viscoelastic; Thermoviscoelasticity; Viscoelastic behaviors; Viscoelasticity","","","","","DGA-RAPID, (DGA-2103404513); French Ministry of Higher Education; French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation","Funding text 1: This document is part of a Ph.D. research project funded by the French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation.This study was supported in part by DGA-RAPID (DGA-2103404513) through the SPRING project with a postdoctoral fellow-ship for R.

Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil","This paper provides a new approach for the analysis of transient heat diffusion arising from conduction. The diffusion is subject to zero and non-zero initial conditions in a two-dimensional domain, containing confined heterogeneous subdomains. This system can be subjected to a heat source. A new formulation is presented, in the frequency domain. It allows coupling between the boundary element method (BEM) and other methods (such as the method of fundamental solutions (MFS), the finite element method (FEM), the finite difference method (FDM), the meshless Petrov-Galerkin (MLGP) method, the virtual element method (VEM), and analytical formulations). The BEM is used for the homogeneous exterior domain and the other method is used to evaluate the solutions for the non-homogeneous confined subdomains, to overcome the specific limitations of each of these methods. An inverse fast Fourier transform was used to provide the time domain responses and the results were then compared with those of reference solutions. It was then possible to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm could be used in the frequency and time domains by performing simulation analyses to study heat diffusion in the neighbourhood of heterogeneous inclusions within a solid medium. © 2022","boundary element method;

The aim is to study the effects of this assembly process on the fatigue strength, assessed at a 106 cycles, of additively produced parts, compared to that of raw rolled products. An original campaign of high cycle fatigue tests based on seven batches of specimens, manufactured additively or cold rolled, one-pieced or assembled, raw or polished, is carried out with a positive load ratio (R= 0.1). A stress relieving heat treatment is applied to all specimens to reduce residual stress levels. Particular attention is paid to identifying the damage mechanisms associated with each batch. Preliminary results allowed an original conclusion that laser welding does not degrade the fatigue strength of additively produced parts. In addition, the fatigue behavior of the studied system depends essentially on the stress concentration generated on the surface or a few micrometers in the underlayer, mainly by the roughness of the LPBF produced parts combined with the lack of fusion (LoF) defects, and in a second order by the geometry of the laser welding channel. Furthermore, additively produced parts showed higher sensitivity to the presence of defects than rolled parts. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing LPBF; High cycle fatigue; Laser welding; Surface defect","3D printers; Additives; Austenitic stainless steel; Cold rolling; High-cycle fatigue; Laser beam welding; Low-cycle fatigue; Metal cladding; Residual stresses; Steel sheet; 316 L stainless steel; Additive manufacturing LPBF; Additive manufacturing process; Assembly process; Autogenous laser welding; Cycle fatigue behaviors; High cycle fatigue; High-cycle fatigue strength; Steel parts; Surface defects","","","","","","","Benoist V., Arnaud L., Baili M., A new method of design for additive manufacturing including machining constraints, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 111, 1, pp. 25-36, (2020); Joshi S.C., Sheikh A.A., 3D printing in aerospace and its long-term sustainability, Virt Phys Prototyp, 10, 4, pp. 175-185, (2015); Koutiri I., Pessard E., Peyre P., Amlou O., De Terris T., Influence of SLM process parameters on the surface finish porosity rate and fatigue behavior of as-built inconel 625 parts, J Mater Process Technol, 255, pp. 536-546, (2018); Vayssette B., Saintier N., Brugger C., May M.E., Pessard E., Numerical modelling of surface roughness effect on the fatigue behavior of Ti-6Al-4V obtained by additive manufacturing, Int J Fatigue, 123, pp. 180-195, (2019); Bonneric M., Brugger C., Saintier N., Investigation of the sensitivity of the fatigue resistance to defect position in aluminium alloys obtained by Selective laser melting using artificial defects, Int J Fatigue, 134, (2020); Le V.D., Pessard E., Morel F., Edy F., Interpretation of the fatigue anisotropy of additively manufactured TA6V alloys via a fracture mechanics approach, Eng Fract Mech, 214, pp. 410-426, (2019); Wu A.S., Brown D.W., Kumar M., Gallegos G.F., King W.E., An experimental investigation into additive manufacturing-induced residual stresses in 316L stainless steel, Metall Mater Trans A, 45, 13, pp. 6260-6270, (2014); DebRoy T., Wei H.L., Zuback J.S., Mukherjee T., Elmer J.W., Milewski J.O., Beese A.M., Wilson-heid A., De A., Zhang W., Additive manufacturing of metallic components–process structure and properties, Progr Mater Sci, 92, pp. 112-224, (2018); Matilainen V.P., Pekkarinen J., Salminen A., Weldability of additive manufactured stainless steel, Physics Procedia, 83, pp. 808-817, (2016); Rautio T., Makikangas J., Kumpula J., Jarvenpaa A., Hamada A., Laser welding of laser powder bed fusion manufactured inconel 718: Microstructure and mechanical properties, KEM, 883, pp. 234-241, (2020); Wu S.C., Hu Y.N., Duan H., Yu C., Jiao H.S., On the fatigue performance of laser hybrid welded high Zn 7000 alloys for next generation railway components, Int J Fatigue, 91, pp. 1-10, (2016); Jokisch T., Marko A., Gook S., Ustundag O., Gumenyuk A., Rethmeier M., Laser welding of SLM-manufactured tubes made of IN625 and IN718, Materials, 12, 18, (2019); Yang J., Wang Y., Li F., Huang W., Jing G., Wang Z., Zeng X., Weldability microstructure and mechanical properties of laser-welded selective laser melted 304 stainless steel joints, J Mater Sci Technol, 35, pp. 1817-1824, (2019); Rautio T., Hamada A., Makikangas J., Jaskari M., Jarvenpaa A., Laser welding of selective laser melted Ti6Al4V: Microstructure and mechanical properties, Mater Today Proc, 28, pp. 907-911, (2020); Eibl M., Sonsino C.M., Kaufmann H., Zhang G., Fatigue assessment of laser welded thin sheet aluminium, Int J Fatigue, 25, 8, pp. 719-731, (2003); Zhang Y., Hu X., Jiang Y., Study on the microstructure and fatigue behavior of a laser-welded Ni-based alloy manufactured by selective laser melting method, J Mater Eng Performance, 29, 5, pp. 2957-2968, (2020); Mokhtari M., Pommier P., Balcaen Y., Alexis J., Laser welding of AISI 316L stainless steel produced by additive manufacturing or by conventional processes, J Manuf Mater Process, 5, 4, (2021); ISO 1099, Metallic materials — Fatigue testing — Axial force-controlled method, (2017); Salman O.O., Gammer C., Chaubey A.K., Eckert J., Scudino S., Effect of heat treatment on microstructure and mechanical properties of 316L steel synthesized by selective laser melting, Mater.

Therefore, nutrient concentration data of Poyang Lake in the past three decades were selected for spatial and temporal heterogeneity analysis. The entropy-based method (EBM) was used to calculate the contribution weight of three independent driving factors (precipitation, agricultural land area, and urban land area) to nutrient concentrations in Poyang Lake in three different periods (1988-1997, 1998-2007, and 2008-2018). The results of this study showed that the concentrations of NH3-N and total nitrogen (TN) have similar trends over time, both of which have been increasing in this century, while the total phosphorus (TP) concentration has experienced a decreasing-increasing process. The nutrient concentrations in the eastern part of Poyang Lake were at the highest level in the whole lake after 1998, and this area has good conditions for the formation of algal blooms, which need special control and management. The effect of precipitation on the nutrient concentrations of the lake in the last 30 years was most prominent. The weight of agriculture's contribution to nutrient concentrations showed a significant upward trend during the first 20 years, and agriculture and urban construction weights remained stable after experiencing opposite changes in the first 20 years. In the future, precipitation in the Poyang Lake basin needs to be of high concern, and agricultural and urban pollution control measures need to be implemented continuously. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Driving factors; Entropy-based method (EBM); Nutrient concentration; Poyang Lake","China; Jiangxi; Poyang Lake; Agriculture; Ammonia; Entropy; Nutrients; Pollution control; Water; Concentration data; Driving factors; Entropy-based method; Entropy-based methods; Fresh water lakes; Independent driving; Land areas; Nutrient concentrations; Poyang Lake; Spatial and temporal heterogeneity; concentration (composition); entropy; factor analysis; freshwater environment; heterogeneity; lake water; trace element; water quality; Lakes","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51779075, 52179064); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, PAPD, (51479064); Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Province of China","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51779075 and 52179064), Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (No. 51479064), and Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province.

The fractional-derivative Merchant (FDM) model has been introduced into the consolidation system to simulate the viscoelasticity. Swartzendruber’s flow law is also introduced to describe the non-Darcian flow characteristics simultaneously. The generalized numerical solution of the 1D consolidation under continuous boundaries is given by the finite difference scheme. Furthermore, to illustrate the effectiveness of the numerical method, two simplified cases are compared against the current analytical and numerical results. Finally, the effects of boundary parameters and model parameters on the viscoelastic consolidation were illustrated and discussed. The results indicated that the boundary parameters have a significant influence on consolidation. The larger the values of boundary parameters, the faster the whole dissipation of the excess pore-water pressure and soils’ settlement rate. Fractional-order and viscosity parameter have little effect on consolidation, which are primarily significant in the middle and late consolidation phases. With the increase of the modulus ratio, the whole consolidation process becomes faster. Moreover, considering Swartzendruber’s flow delays the consolidation rate of the soil layer. © 2022, Central South University.","continuous drainage boundaries; finite difference method; fractional-derivative;

Using the titanium implant as an electrode and the packaging wall as a dielectric barrier, a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma was generated, allowing the implant to remain sterile. Numerical and experimental investigations were conducted to determine the optimal discharge conditions for eliminating hydrocarbon impurities, which are known to degrade the bioactivity of the implant. XPS measurement confirmed that plasma treatment reduced the amount of carbon impurities on the implant surface by approximately 60%. Additionally, in vitro experiments demonstrated that the surface treatment significantly improved cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. Collectively, we proposed a plasma treatment source for dental implants that successfully removes carbon impurities and facilitate the osseointegration of SLA implants. © 2022, The Author(s).","Dielectric barrier discharge; Hydrocarbon; Osseointegration; Surface treatment; Titanium implant","Carbon; Cell adhesion; Dental prostheses; Dielectric barrier discharge; Dielectric devices; Dielectric materials; Flow control; Plasma applications; Surface treatment; Titanium; Titanium alloys; alkaline phosphatase; carbon; hydrocarbon; titanium; Carbon impurities; Cylindrical plasmas; Dielectric barrier; Dielectric barrier discharge plasmas; Dielectric barrier discharges; Osseointegration; Plasma surface treatment; Plasma treatment; Titanium dental implants; Titanium implants; adsorption; Article; biological activity; cell adhesion; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; cell proliferation assay; efficacy parameters; extracellular matrix; image analysis; in vitro study; mathematical model; medical procedures; osseointegration; plasma surface treatment; scanning electron microscopy; X ray photoemission spectroscopy; Hydrocarbons","","alkaline phosphatase, 9001-78-9; carbon, 7440-44-0; titanium, 7440-32-6","","","Plasmapp Co., Ltd.; Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (2020R1F1A1073385); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Ministry of SMEs and Startups, MSS, (P0018200, S2850646); Ministry of SMEs and Startups, MSS","Funding text 1: HJJ, JYK, SHL, HK, and YL are employees of Plasmapp Co., Ltd.

Critical quality indicators with distinct technological and industrial impact are surface roughness, dimensional accuracy, and porosity, among others. Their achieving scores can be optimized by adjusting the 3D printing process parameters. The effect of six (6) 3D printing control parameters, i.e., raster deposition angle, infill density, nozzle temperature, bed temperature, printing speed, and layer thickness, on the aforementioned quality indicators is investigated herein. Optical Microscopy, Optical Profilometry, and Micro Χ-Ray Computed Tomography were employed to investigate and document these quality characteristics. Experimental data were processed with Robust Design Theory. An L25 Taguchi orthogonal array (twenty-five runs) was compiled, for the six control parameters with five levels for each one of them. The predictive quadratic regression models were then validated with two additional confirmation runs, with five replicas each. For the first time, the surface quality features, as well as the geometrical and structural characteristics were investigated in such depth (>500 GB of raw experimental data were produced and processed). A deep insight into the quality of the MEX 3D printed parts is provided allowing the control parameters’ ranking and optimization. Prediction equations for the quality features as functions of the control parameters are introduced herein, with merit in the market-driven practice. © 2022 The Authors","3D printing; Computed tomography (CT); Polylactic acid (PLA); Porosity; Surface roughness","","","","","","","","Abbott A.C., Tandon G.P., Bradford R.L., Koerner H., Baur J.W., Process-structure-property effects on ABS bond strength in fused filament fabrication, Addit.

Thanks to their properties, aluminium alloys are extensively used in aerospace, rail, and automotive industries. Laser metal deposition (LMD), among the AM processes, can manufacture complex features as well as reinforcement structures on pre-existing complex parts. The work performed within the SAMOA project aims to expand the knowledge of the material properties of aluminum alloys when the LMD process is performed under atmospheric conditions. Both common alloys (AlSi10Mg, AlSi1Mg) and AM-specific alloys (AM205 and AlSi1Mg + 1 wt. %Zr) were analyzed and compared. Results show significantly lower amounts of internal defects and higher mechanical properties in AM-specific alloys. This database of mechanical properties will be used to design, simulate, and fabricate reinforcement structures on car frames to enhance their crash resistance and increase vehicle security. Moreover, to reduce material waste, the SAMOA project focuses also on the effects of powder recycling by analyzing both chemical and physical changes in the powder. The higher concentration of oxygen and hydrogen was separately analyzed by artificially increasing their concentration by heat treating AlSi10Mg powder. Results showed similar processability with a reduction in UTS of -31.4% and an increased elongation at fracture of +112.5%. Recycled powder, on the other hand, could not be easily collected, sieved, and reused since the identified physical and chemical changes of the powder lower its processability.  © 2022 Author(s).","","Accidents; Automotive industry; Chemical analysis; Deposition; Powder metals; Recycling; Reinforcement; Silicon alloys; Additive manufacturing process; Chemical change; Complex parts; Deposition process; Feature structure; Laser metal deposition; Physical changes; Processability; Property; Reinforcement structures; Aluminum alloys","","","","","European Institute of Innovation and Technology, EIT","This study was accomplished within the European project SAMOA (No. 18079) funded by EIT Raw Materials.","Ma K., Smith T., Lavernia E.J., Schoenung J.M., Environmental sustainability of laser metal deposition: The role of feedstock powder and feedstock utilization factor, Proc.

To this end, Fe–50 %Ni samples with homogeneous distributions of Fe and Ni were produced using three different rotation strategies through the directed energy deposition method and subsequent heat treatment. According to subsequent microstructural and crystallographic investigations, a pronounced S {123} 〈634〉 texture component and γ-fiber texture were detected in the as-printed sample produced by 67° rotation, resulting in a relatively undesirable magnetic response. Better magnetic properties were achieved in the 90° rotation strategy, with the Cube {001} 〈100〉 and Brass {011} 〈211〉 texture components predominating, and in the no rotation strategy, with the Cube {001} 〈100〉 and Copper {112} 〈111〉 texture components predominating. Heat treatment increased the intensity of the predominant texture components with no significant changes in grain size. On the other hand, short-time heat treatment for the purposes of texture sharpening and dislocation density reduction enhanced the magnetization saturation, coercivity, and Curie temperature values to ~160 emg/g, 1.7 Oe, and ~540 °C, respectively. These findings demonstrate that in comparison with the conventional process, the two-step production approach consisting of crystallographic texture-engineered laser-based in situ alloying additive manufacturing and short-time heat treatment is an efficient route for enhancing the magnetic performance of soft magnetic materials. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Crystallographic texture; In situ synthesis; Magnetic properties; Soft magnetic materials","Additives; Heat treatment; Iron alloys; Magnetic materials; Magnetic properties; Nickel alloys; Rotation; Saturation magnetization; Textures; Crystallographic orientations; Crystallographic textures; Directed energy; Energy depositions; Homogeneous distribution; In-situ synthesis; In-situ synthesized; Orientation dependent; Permalloys; Texture components; 3D printers","","","","","Ministry of Education, MOE, (2022R1A6A3A13073830); Ministry of Education, MOE; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2020H1D3A1A04105882, NRF-2021R1A2C3006662, NRF-2022R1A5A1030054); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIP) ( NRF-2021R1A2C3006662 , NRF-2022R1A5A1030054 ).

In existing AM processes, extrusion-based AM is popular, in which the material is extruded through the nozzle and moves on the platform according to the pre-defined toolpath. The part build orientation in AM has a crucial effect on the dimensional accuracy, surface quality, support structure, build time, and cost, etc. The layer thickness affects the surface quality and build time of an as-built part. It is preferable to optimize the build orientation and layer thickness simultaneously. This study proposes a build orientation optimization method for extrusion-based AM coupling with adaptive slicing. First, an adaptive slicing method using volume deviation rate is developed. Second, the estimation models of the relative decision criteria are created. In particular, the estimation model of surface roughness is constructed based on a designed benchmark artifact via the actual measurement by a contact surface roughness tester. Third, a set of alternative build orientations are generated based on the minimum bounding rectangles of the facet clusters in a manifold mesh model. Then, an integrated multi-criteria decision-making model composed of the weighted sum model and grey relational analysis is proposed to select an optimal build orientation among the alternatives above. At last, the effectiveness of the proposed method is experimentally validated using two case studies. The results show that the proposed method is desirable to simultaneously optimize the build orientation and layer thickness of parts in extrusion-based AM. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Adaptive slicing; Build orientation optimization; Extrusion-based additive manufacturing; Minimum bounding rectangle; Multi-criteria decision-making","3D printers; Additives; Decision making; Surface properties; Surface roughness; Adaptive slicing; Build orientation; Build orientation optimization; Extrusion-based additive manufacturing; Layer thickness; Minimum bounding rectangle; Multi criteria decision-making; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; Optimisations; Extrusion","","","","","Zhejiang Provincial Key Research and Development Project of China, (LZY22E060002); Zhejiang University President Special Fund Financed by Zhejiang Province, (2021XZZX008); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, NNSF, NSF, NSFC, (51821093, 51935009, 51935009；51821093)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51935009; 51821093); Zhejiang University President Special Fund Financed by Zhejiang Province (2021XZZX008); Zhejiang Provincial Key Research and Development Project of China (LZY22E060002).

It was decided to employ the feedforward backpropagation (BP) algorithm as an adaptive method in ANN. Two types of prosthetic knee joints were employed in this study, a mechanical model (3R60) and a microprocesses model (C-Leg4). Three inputs parameters were used in building the ANN model. This involved, the vertical ground reaction force (vGRF), hip angle and knee angle. The vGRF was measured on the treadmill using Zebris FDM-T system. While, the data of knee angle and hip angle were estimated for prosthetic knee joints using Kinovia program. The flexion moment in knee joint was selected as target parameter for ANN model. Finally, the verification results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of ANN model in prediction the flexion moment in different types of knee prosthesis. Furthermore, there is a good compatible in data of knee flexion moment between microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knee joints with the intact limb which help in improve many of gait features and reduce hip work production. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.","Artificial neural network;

Due to its energy-efficiency and rapid curing of thermosets, a series of applications related to polymer and polymer composite manufacturing have been developed based on FP, in particular additive manufacturing (AM). While the current research demonstrates successful printing of 1D, 2D and 3D structures based on FP, a key challenge is the determination of the printing parameters through trial-and-error, which hinders its large-scale application. To better understand how different process parameters affect the front behavior and the printing process, and eventually enable fast printing of complex parts without trial-and-error, computational modeling of the printing process is highly desired. For the first time, we develop a multiphysics finite element model for simulating FP-assisted AM which accounts for both the thermal-chemical process and the ink deposition in a real printing process. To simulate the dynamic ink deposition process, element activation is used that constantly adds elements to the simulation domain following a predefined printing path and velocity. A coupled thermo-chemical partial differential equation system is solved over the changing ink domain to simulate the heat transfer and chemical reaction during the printing process. The model is first validated by comparing the front temperature history during the printing process with the experimental infrared thermal measurements. The validated model enables the determination of proper printing velocity range, within which the polymerization front can follow the printing such that the ink will not deform before curing, which is critical to ensure printing accuracy. Furthermore, the simulation reveals the change of front temperature and degree of cure between different layers, and their dependency on layer length and printing velocity, providing insights into the printing experiments for processing parameters selection. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Frontal polymerization; Multiphysics modeling; Process parameters; Thermosets","Additives; Curing; Deposition; Energy efficiency; Fused Deposition Modeling; Heat transfer; Polymerization; Printing presses; Frontal polymerization; Layer by layer; Multiphysics model; Polymer components; Printing process; Process parameters; Reaction front; Self-propagating exothermic reactions; Thermoset polymers; Trial and error; Thermosets","","","","","Department of Mechanical Engineering at Colorado State University; Energy Institute at Colorado State University; NASA EPSCoR; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (80NSSC19M0061); University of Wyoming, UW","Funding text 1: This work has been funded by the Wyoming NASA EPSCoR, NASA Grant #80NSSC19M0061.

A bare FBG is small and light; hence, it can be easily embedded into hosting materials. However, conventional fabrication methods are generally time-consuming with reproducibility issues. A more recent strategy has been proposed to develop novel FBG-based systems by encapsulating the grating within 3-D-printed structures. This process, known as 3-D printing, is characterized by several advantages like rapid prototyping, printing precision, and high customization. The possibility of quickly personalizing the 3-D-printed sensors by customizing the infill settings makes this technique very appealing for medical purposes, especially for developing smart systems. However, the influence of printing settings on the sensor response has not been yet systematically addressed. This work aimed at combining FBG with the most popular 3-D printing technique (the fused deposition modeling [FDM]) to develop four 3-D-printed sensors with different printing profiles. We chose two patterns (triangle and gyroid) and two infill densities (30% and 60%) to investigate their influence on the sensors' response to strain, temperature, and relative humidity (RH), and on the hysteresis behavior. Then, we preliminary assess the sensor performance in a potential application scenario for FBG-based 3-D printing technology: the cardiorespiratory monitoring. The promising results confirm that our analysis can be considered the first effort to improve the knowledge about the influence of printing profiles on sensor performance and, consequently, pave the way to develop highly performant 3-D-printed sensors customized for specific applications.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.","3-D printing technology; fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors; fused model deposition; infill properties; medical applications; metrological characterization; wearable systems","Deposition; Electric sensing devices; Fiber optic sensors; Fused Deposition Modeling; Infill drilling; Medical applications; Three dimensional displays; Wearable sensors; 3-dimensional printing; 3-dimensional printing technology; Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors; Fiber gratings; Fused model deposition; Infill property; Metrological characterization; Printing technologies; Property; Sensor phenomenon and characterizations; Three-dimensional display; Three-dimensional-printing; Wearable systems; Fiber Bragg gratings","","","","","H2020/ICT European Project; Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte, MECD, (UIDP/50025/2020, LA/P/0037/2020); Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte, MECD; CON-BOTS, (CEEIND/00154/2020, ICT-09-2019-2020); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (871803); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (UIDB/50025/2020); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT","This work was supported in part by the FCT/MEC through the project i3N under Grant UIDB/50025/2020, Grant UIDP/50025/2020, and Grant LA/P/0037/2020; and in part by the H2020/ICT European Project \u201CCONnected through roBOTS (CON-BOTS): physically coupling humans to boost handwriting and music learning\u201D under Grant ICT-09-2019-2020.

However, the interfacial bonding force of PCL coating has always been the key factor affecting their application. In this paper, a micro-nano graded laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) NiTi alloy surface was created by nanosecond laser pretreatment innovatively and observed by scanning electron microscopy. Nano-scratch experiments were performed to assay the interfacial bonding force, and the corrosion behavior was carried out by the potentiodynamic polarization test. The results show that the high surface roughness and micro-nano hierarchical structure of the nanosecond laser machining surface conduce to achieve superior interfacial bonding force compared with the mechanically polished sample. Meanwhile, the 80 μJ-PCLcoated sample can obtain the most excellent corrosion resistance in simulated body fluids (SBF), clearly indicating nanosecond laser machining is a promising pretreatment for enhancing the interfacial bonding force and anti-corrosion of coatings. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Corrosion; Interfacial bonding force; NiTi; Polycaprolactone coating","3D printers; Binary alloys; Biocompatibility; Body fluids; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant coatings; Corrosive effects; Scanning electron microscopy; Surface roughness; Bonding forces; Excellent corrosion resistances; Interfacial bonding; Interfacial bonding force; Laser machining; Laser powders; Nanosecond lasers; NiTi alloys; Polycaprolactone coating; Powder bed; Titanium alloys","","","","","","","Nematollahi M., Safaei K., Bayati P., Elahinia M., Mater.

Design/methodology/approach: In the proposed model, time integration is performed with an implicit scheme. The equations for heat transfer are discretized by a finite volume method with thermophysical properties of the metal powder and an updated convection coefficient at each time step. The model includes convective and radiative boundary conditions for the exposed surfaces of the part and constant temperatures for the bottom surface on the build plate. The laser source is modeled as a moving radiative heat flux along the scanning pattern, while the thermal gradients are used to calculate directional and von Mises residual thermal stresses by using a quasi-steady state assumption. Findings: In this study, four different scanning patterns are analyzed, and the transient temperature and residual thermal stress fields are evaluated from these patterns. It is found that the highest stresses occur where the laser last leaves off on its scanning pattern for each layer. Originality/value: The proposed model is designed to capture the layer-by-layer deposition for a three-dimensional geometry while considering the effect of the instantaneous melting of the powder, melt pool, dynamic calculation of thermophysical properties, ease of parametrization of various process parameters and the vectorization of the code for computational efficiency. This versatile model can be used for process parameter optimization of other laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing techniques. Furthermore, the proposed approach can be used for analyzing different scanning patterns. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing; DMLS; Scanning pattern; Thermal gradient; Thermal residual stress","Additives;

Especially in recent years, efficient and optimum design of the transformer has become increasingly important. This study presents a comparative analysis of the application of metaheuristic optimization algorithms in transformer design for maximum efficiency of a three-phase dry-type transformer. In addition, transformer modeling was done using FEM analysis, and its magnetic characteristics were shown. The main contribution of this paper is to optimize the determined basic design parameters with optimization methods that have not been used in transformer optimization before and to maximize efficiency by reducing losses. During this process, using the loss constants of the materials in the basic loss equation for core loss, this process was tried to be carried out without any change in the method in applications to be made with different materials. This situation also strengthens the accuracy of the applied method. Crow Search (CSA), Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO), Vortex Optimization (VOA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Social Learning-Particle Swarm Optimization (SL-PSO) algorithms were used in the study. The loss values were obtained by performing loaded and unloaded FEM analysis with the ANSYS/Maxwell program. As a result, the best result was obtained with SL-PSO as max 99,05%. © 2022, Strojarski Facultet.

Moreover, we investigated the effect of interstitial C content on the microstructure, room temperature tensile properties and deformation behavior of MEA. The initial microstructure shows that both AM-built interstitial C-doped MEAs had a heterogeneous grain structure and epitaxial growth grains along the building direction. The analysis of electron channeling contrast images showed a large amount of nano-sized precipitates (in-situ precipitates) distributed at the sub-structure boundaries formed by a dislocation network, and a large number of stacking faults were simultaneously observed inside the sub-structure. The fraction of in-situ precipitates was higher in 0.75 C MEA than in 0.25 C MEA. A room temperature tensile test measured yield strengths (YS) of 747.5 MPa for 0.25 C MEA and 832.2 MPa for 0.75 C MEA, indicating the highest properties among additively manufactured MEAs reported to date. Considering the strengthening mechanisms, we compared the microstructural characteristics that affected YS, and identified that in-situ precipitates and high-dislocation density were major strengthening factors. On the other hand, deformation twin, which improves strain hardening rate and ductility was observed in both alloys. Based on the above results, we discuss the correlation of microstructure, mechanical properties, and deformation mechanism of AM-built interstitial NiCoCr MEA. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Deformation behavior; Interstitial carbon; Medium-entropy alloy; Microstructure; Nano-sized precipitates; Tensile property","3D printers; Additives; Cobalt alloys; Deformation; Entropy; High-entropy alloys; More electric aircraft; Strain hardening; Strain rate; Tensile properties; Tensile testing; C contents; Carbon content; Deformation behavior; Interstitial carbons; Interstitials; Medium entropy; Medium-entropy alloy; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Nano-sized precipitates; Sub-structures; Microstructure","","","","","National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, MEST, (2022R1A2C3006964)","This study was supported by National Research Foundation of Korea ( NRF ) grant funded by the Korea government ( MEST ) (No. 2022R1A2C3006964 ).

Analyses were focused on the different microstructures developed and on steel fracture behavior in terms of tensile fracture elongation, Charpy impact properties, and linear elastic fracture toughness. Comparisons were also drawn by testing a reference 4130 steel fabricated from a gas atomized powder. The slightly higher oxygen content found in the water atomized powder led to the formation of finely dispersed nano-size oxide particles in the steel matrix. It was found that these inclusions have a minor effect on the tensile properties, but a significant influence on the impact toughness response. The fracture toughness tests showed that the orientation leading to propagation of cracks along the inter-layer planes represented the most critical situation, and the steel toughness could be significantly improved after the quench and tempering treatment owing to the achievement of a more homogeneous microstructure. The results suggest that the investigated water atomized low-alloy steel powder feedstock can be considered as a suitable and cheaper alternative for structural parts produced by additive manufacturing, which could replace the more popular gas atomized steel grades. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Fracture toughness; Hardenability; Laser powder bed fusion; Low-alloy steel; Non-metallic inclusions; Water atomized powder","Ductile fracture; Fracture mechanics; Fracture toughness; High strength steel; Microstructure; Particle size analysis; Steel metallurgy; Strain; Tempering; 4130 steels; Hardenability; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Low-alloy steel; Non-metallic inclusions; Plane strain fracture toughness; Powder bed; Steel powder; Water atomized powders; Alloy steel","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education of the Arab Republic of Egypt; Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR; Politecnico di Milano","The investigation was carried out within the frame of the SPAcEMAN project funded by EIT-Raw Materials in 2018–2021.

From theoretical aspect, a novel theoretical model is developed as a function of layer deposition orientation, layer thickness, finishing working time, density ratio and hardness ratio to estimate the surface roughness profile of FDM part at different finishing conditions and finishing time intervals. Meanwhile, from the experimental aspect, an experimental campaign was performed under different mechanical and mechanical-chemical finishing conditions to verify the theoretical model and also assess the surface and subsurface characteristics of the polished parts. Design/methodology/approach: The theoretical model commences with an approximation of surface profile of the FDM part through a sequence of parabola arcs, continues with the calculation of reference line and machined surface profile and leads to a formulation of surface roughness of as-printed and polished surface. In the experimental section, the FDM parts are polished under dry, pure water, 25% and 50% volumetric aqueous acetone solutions finishing conditions through CDF technique. Findings: The comparison between experimental and theoretical results reveals 9% mean absolute error between theoretical and experimental results. Meanwhile, Rq reduction percentage of polished parts under dry, pure water, 25% and 50% aqueous acetone solutions are 66.1%, 54.5%, 56.9% and 67.2%, respectively. The scanning electron microscopy results reveal severe layer damage in dry finishing condition, while the application of 50% aqueous acetone as a polishing solution completely eliminates layer damage. Another promising finding was sticky material phenomenon on the surface of polished part under 25% finishing condition. The Shore hardness test illustrates that the surface hardness improvement of the polished parts under dry, pure water, 25% and 50% aqueous acetone solutions finishing conditions are 8.4%, 2.25%, 4.36% and 10.8%, respectively. The results also revealed that the dimension variation of polished parts under dry, pure water, 25% and 50% aqueous acetone solutions are 0.634%, 0.525%, 0.545% and 0.608%, respectively. The edge profile radius of the as-printed part is 134 µm, while the edge profiles radius of the polished parts under dry, pure water, 25% aqueous acetone solution and 50% aqueous acetone solution are 785.5 µm, 545.5 µm, 623.5 µm and 721.5 µm, respectively, at the polishing time of 720 min. Originality/value: This paper fulfills an identified need to study the benefits of the mechanical-chemical polishing technique in comparison to mechanical and chemical polishing strategy of the FDM parts for the first time. Beside the experimental campaign, the novel analytical formulation of surface roughness as a function of mechanical properties of abrasive media and FDM part and finishing specifications provides a valuable insight in the case of material-removal processes. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing; Centrifugal disk finishing; Fused deposition modeling; Mechanical-chemical polishing; Roughness prediction; Surface finishing; Surface improvement; Surface roughness","Acetone; Additives; Aspect ratio; Centrifugation; Chemical mechanical polishing; Density functional theory; Deposition; Fused Deposition Modeling; Hardness; Scanning electron microscopy; 'Dry' [; Acetone solution; Aqueous acetone; Centrifugal disk finishing; Condition; Pure water; Roughness predictions; Surface finishing; Surface improvement; Theoretical modeling; Surface roughness","","","","","","","Adibi H., Hashemi M.R., Experimental study on tensile strength of copper micro particles filled polymer composites printed by fused deposition modelling process, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 28, 1, pp. 21-31, (2022); Akhouri D., Banerjee D., Mishra S.B., A review report on the plating process of fused deposition modelling (FDM) built parts, Materials Today: Proceedings, 26, pp. 2140-2142, (2020); Atzeni E., Balestrucci A., Catalano A.R., Iuliano L., Priarone P.C., Salmi A., Settineri L., Performance assessment of a vibro-finishing technology for additively manufactured components, Procedia CIRP, 88, pp. 427-432, (2020); Baligidad S., Kaup V., Maharudresh A.C., Kumar G.C., Elangovan K., Quantitative analysis of surface treatment to enhance surface finish and mechanical characteristics of ABS parts, Applied Physics A 2020 126:8, 126, 8, pp. 1-10, (2020); Boschetto A., Bottini L., Roughness prediction in coupled operations of fused deposition modeling and barrel finishing, Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 219, pp. 181-192, (2015); Boschetto A., Bottini L., Surface improvement of fused deposition modeling parts by barrel finishing, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 21, 6, pp. 686-696, (2015); Boschetto A., Bottini L., Veniali F., Finishing of fused deposition modeling parts by CNC machining, Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 41, pp. 92-101, (2016); Boschetto A., Bottini L., Veniali F., Surface roughness and radiusing of Ti6Al4V selective laser melting-manufactured parts conditioned by barrel finishing, The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 94, 5-8, pp. 2773-2790, (2018); Boschetto A., Bottini L., Macera L., Veniali F., Post-processing of complex SLM parts by barrel finishing, Applied Sciences.

However, the scalar nature of the SLM-induced phase response is a potential hurdle when applying the approach to wideband light, as is typical in astronomical imaging. For the first time, to our knowledge, we present laboratory results with broadband light (up to ∼12% bandwidth) for two commercially available SLM devices used as active focal-plane phase masks in the visible regime (640 nm). It is shown that under ideal or realistic telescope aperture conditions, the contrast performance is negligibly affected in this bandwidth regime, reaching a sufficient level for ground-based high-contrast imaging, which is typically dominated by atmospheric residuals. © 2022 Optica Publishing Group.","","Focusing; Light modulation; Light modulators; Liquid crystals; Coronagraphy; Focal Plane; High contrast imaging; Liquid crystal spatial light modulators; Mask opening; Performance; Phase response; Spatial light modulators; Technological progress; Wide-band; Bandwidth","","","","","Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich, ETH; University of Bern, UB; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (154800)","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F\u00F6rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung (NCCR PlanetS #TP_SF6, PZ00P2_154800).

The effect of channel aspect ratio up to 2:1 on thermal-hydraulic performance is explored in additively manufactured rectangular channels and square channels, both with and without 60 deg ribs on the top and bottom sides. The Wilson-plot method is employed to experimentally measure channel-averaged Nusselt number over a Reynolds number range up to 370,000. The friction factor is calculated from pressure drop and mass flow rate and additionally, the overall thermal performance factor (TPF) is reported. A companion computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation is performed for the rib turbulated cooling configurations reported in the experiments using the Reynolds average Navier–Stokes-based turbulence model. The objective of the numerical study is to gain insight into the local heat transfer augmentation in the ribbed channels as a result of varying the aspect ratio, channel configuration (square versus rectangular), operating conditions (Reynolds number) and the surface roughness, an inherent outcome of the additive manufacturing process. Surface roughness is simulated using sand grain roughness height (KS) calculated from the experimental data, and a comparison is presented with the corresponding channel configuration with varying surface roughness heights starting from smooth surfaces (KS ¼ 0). Experimental results indicate that the heat transfer augmentation is negligible in the rectangular channels with ribs on the long side compared to the square channel. However, it is enhanced by 60% in comparison to placing ribs on the shorter side. The TPF remains constant at around 1 for the entire range of Reynolds numbers consistent with prior work at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). The simulation results highlight that increased surface roughness can have a favorable considerable influence on Nusselt number and overall thermal performance enhancement.

These devices are used in the military, industry, medicine and in other areas of science and technology. The paper presents the theoretical assessment and analysis of the InAs/InAs1−xSbx type-II superlattice (T2SL) (grown on GaSb buffer layer) strain impact on the bandgap energy and on the effective masses of electrons and holes at 150 K. The theoretical research was carried out with the use of the commercial program SimuApsys (Crosslight). The k·p method was adopted in T2SL modeling. Luttinger coefficients (γ1, γ2 and γ3) were assessed assuming the Kane coefficient F = 0. The bandgap energy of ternary materials (InAsxSb1−x) was determined assuming that the bowing parameter (bg) for the above-mentioned temperature is bg = 750 meV. The cutoff wavelength values were estimated based on the theoretically determined absorption coefficients (from approximation the quadratic absorption coefficient). The bandgap energy was calculated according to the following formula: Eg = 1.24/λcutoff. The theoretical simulations allowed us to conclude that the strain in T2SL causes the Eg shift, which also has an impact on the effective masses me and mh, playing an important role for the device’s optical and electrical performance. The T2SLs-simulated results at 150 K are comparable to those measured experimentally. © 2022 by the authors.","effective masses; infrared detectors; k·p method; type-II superlattice","Antimony compounds; Buffer layers; Energy gap; Gallium compounds; III-V semiconductors; Indium antimonides; Absorption coefficients; Band gap energy; Effective mass; Infrared detection; K-p method; Military industries; Property; Science and Technology; Type II; Type-II superlattice; Indium arsenide","","","","","Narodowe Centrum Nauki, NCN, (UMO-2019/33/B/ST7/00614)","The paper was partially supported by the National Science Centre (Poland), grant no.

Thus, the aim of this study was to examine whether wearing a mandibular splint, which retains the occlusion close to the centric occlusion, can increase or decrease balance stability and the range of motion (ROM) of the cervical spine as opposed to the habitual occlusion, and if there is a difference between men and women. Material and methods: In this study, 41 male (34.7 ± 11.4 years) and 50 female subjects (29.3 ± 12.7 years) participated. Cervical spine ROM was recorded using the Zebris CMS 70P system. For balance stability, a pressure measuring platform integrated into the treadmill system (FDM-T) of the company Zebris® Medical GmbH was used. Here, the area of the ellipse and the length of the Center of Pressure (CoP) was recorded whilst in the bipedal and unipedal stance. Results: The sex comparison showed significant differences for the area of the ellipse of the right leg and ROM extension in the habitual occlusion: females showed a better balance stability and a larger ROM extension. When wearing the splint, only the CoP of the left leg was significant with a better balance stability in female subjects. Within the male subjects, the ellipse area in the bipedal and unipedal (left/right) stance showed mostly significant reductions, while the rotation left and right as well as the lateral flexion (left/right) improved when wearing the splint. Female subjects, when wearing the splint, showed a significant decrease of the ellipse area and the CoP length when standing on either leg. Flexion, rotation to the right and lateral flexion to the left/right, all increased significantly. Conclusion: Wearing a splint that keeps the jaw close to the centric relation improved balance stability and increased the ROM of the cervical spine for both male and female subjects. Women may have marginally different basic balance stability strategies than men, with regard to bipedal and unipedal standing. Nevertheless, there are scarcely any differences between the two sexes in the adaptation when wearing a splint. Changing the jaw relation in healthy adults can possibly support the release of movement potentials that simplify the performance of everyday activities or sports movements. © 2022 by the authors.","cervical vertebrae; postural balance; range of motion; sex characteristics; splint","","","","","","","","Wanke E.M., Schreiter J., Groneberg D.A., Weisser B., Muscular imbalances and balance capability in dance, J.

Design/methodology/approach: Single-track experiments were conducted during the fabrication process to obtain the single tracks with excellent wettability to narrow the process parameter window. The effects of process parameters on the build surface, cross-section, relative density, defects, surface roughness, microstructure and mechanical properties of the parts were analyzed through multilayer fabrication experiments and surface optimization experiments. Findings: The point distance has the greatest influence on the build surface of the fabricated parts, and the unmelted defects can be eliminated when the point distance is 35 µm. The relative density of the fabricated parts decreased with the increase of the point distance, and the hatch spacing has different characteristics with respect to the relative density of the fabricated parts under different laser powers. It was observed that the most of experimental groups with higher relative densities than 99%, and the highest density could reach 99.99%. The surface roughness can be reduced to less than 10 µm through remelting optimization. Originality/value: The research results can provide theoretical support for scientific researchers and data support for engineers. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Defect; Laser powder bed fusion; Manufacturing quality; Process parameters; Ti-6Al-4V","Density (specific gravity); Fabrication; Surface roughness; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Fabricated parts; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Manufacturing quality; Performance; Point distances; Powder bed; Process parameters; Relative density; Ti-6al-4v; Aluminum alloys","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51875010); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","Funding: This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China Grant Number 51875010.

The study aims to extend the use of FDM printers for 3D printing of low melting point alloy (LMPA), which has applications in the electronics industry, rapid tooling, biomedical, etc. Design/methodology/approach: Solder is the LMPA with alloy’s melting temperature (around 200°C) lower than the parent metals. The most common composition of the solder, which is widely used, is tin and lead. However, lead is a hazardous material having environmental and health deteriorating effects. Therefore, lead-free Sn89Bi10Cu non-eutectic alloy in the form of filament was used. The step-by-step method has been used to identify the process window for temperature, print speed, filament length (E) and layer height. The existing FDM printer was customized for the present work. Findings: Analysis of infrared images has been done to understand discontinuity at a certain range of process parameters. The effect of printing parameters on inter-bonding, width and thickness of the layers has also been studied. The microstructure of the parent material and deposited bead has been observed. Conclusions were drawn out based on the results, and the scope for the future has been pointed out. Originality/value: The experiments resulted in the process window identification of print speed, extrusion temperature, filament length and layer height of Sn89Bi10Cu which is not done previously. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","3D; Alloys; Filament length; Fused deposition modelling (FDM); Layer height; Low melting point alloy (LMPA); Measurement; Print speed; Temperature","Bismuth alloys; Copper alloys; Deposition; Electronics industry; Fused Deposition Modeling; Infrared imaging; Melting point; Printing presses; Ternary alloys; 3-D printing; 3d; 3D-printing; Filament length; Fused deposition modeling; Layer height; Low melting point alloy; Print speed; Process window; Tin alloys","","","","","Science and Engineering Research Board, SERB, (CRG/2019/001320); Science and Engineering Research Board, SERB","Funding text 1: Funding: The work was supported by the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) (Grant No. CRG/2019/001320). ; Funding text 2: The authors are thankful to the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) – India for funding the project.

Here, a promising combined chemotherapeutic strategy of salinomycin (SL) and doxorubicin (DOX) with specific inhibition of tumor stemness by a targeted co-delivery nanosystem was developed to overcome this abnormal progression. This strategy could be benefit drugs to effectively penetrate and infiltrate into spheres of 3D-cultured breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). The expression of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway-related genes (β-catenin, LRP6, LEF1, and TCF12) and target genes (Cyclin D1, Cmyc, and Fibronectin) as well as CSC stemness-related genes (Oct4, Nanog, and Hes1) was downregulated by redox-sensitive co-delivery micelles decorated with oligohyaluronic acid as the active targeting moiety. The changes in EMT-associated gene expression (E-cadherin and Vimentin) in vitro showed that the EMT process was also effectively inverted. This strategy achieved a strong inhibitory effect on solid tumor growth and an effective reduction in the risk of tumor metastasis in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice in vivo and effectively alleviated splenomegaly caused by the malignant tumor. Immunohistochemical staining analysis of E-cadherin, Vimentin, and β-catenin confirmed that the inversion of the EMT was also achieved in solid tumors. These results highlight the potential of SL and DOX combined chemotherapeutic strategy for eliminating breast carcinoma. Statement of significance: Cancer stem cells (CSCs), as an important part of tumor heterogeneity, can survive against conventional chemotherapy and initiate tumorigenesis, recurrence, and metastasis. Moreover, non-CSCs can convert into the CSC state through the abnormal Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which is closely related to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Here, redox-degradable binary drug-loaded micelles (PPH/DOX+SL) were designed to target CSCs and overcome drug resistance of breast cancer cells. The combined chemotherapy of salinomycin (SL) and doxorubicin (DOX) reversed drug resistance, while the PPH/DOX+SL micelles enhanced the intracellular accumulation and drug penetration of BCSC spheres. The introduction of SL downregulated the expression of tumor stemness genes and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway-related genes and inverted the EMT process. PPH/DOX+SL continuously inhibited tumor growth and invasion in vivo. © 2022","Combined chemotherapy; EMT; Salinomycin; Tumor stemness; Wnt/β-catenin","Animals; beta Catenin; Cadherins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cyclin D1; Doxorubicin; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Fibronectins; Mice; Micelles; Neoplasms; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Vimentin; Wnt Signaling Pathway; Cancer cells; Cell signaling; Chemotherapy; Controlled drug delivery; Cytology; Diseases; Gene expression; Glycoproteins; Mammals; Micelles; Pathology; Stem cells; Targeted drug delivery; beta catenin; cyclin D1; doxorubicin; fibronectin; low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 6; lymphoid enhancer factor 1; octamer transcription factor 4; salinomycin; transcription factor HES 1; transcription factor NANOG; uvomorulin; vimentin; Wnt protein; beta catenin; cadherin; cyclin D1; doxorubicin; fibronectin; vimentin; Breast cancer cells; Cancer stem cells; Combined chemotherapy; Doxorubicin; Epithelial-mesenchymal transition; Salinomycin; Transition process; Tumor stemness; Wnt/β-catenin; β-catenin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; apoptosis rate; Article; body weight change; breast cancer cell line; breast carcinoma; cancer inhibition; cell viability; combination chemotherapy; controlled study; cytotoxicity; down regulation; drug formulation; drug penetration; drug release; drug resistance; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; flow cytometry; gene control; gene expression; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; internalization (cell); lung parenchyma; malignant neoplasm; marker gene; metastasis; metastasis inhibition; micelle; mouse; nonhuman; oncogene c myc; quantitative analysis; signal transduction; splenomegaly; tumor volume; animal; cancer stem cell; metabolism; neoplasm; pathology; tumor cell line; Wnt signaling; Tumors","","doxorubicin, 23214-92-8, 25316-40-9; fibronectin, 86088-83-7; lymphoid enhancer factor 1, 138415-19-7; salinomycin, 53003-10-4, 55721-31-8; uvomorulin, 112956-45-3; beta Catenin, ; Cadherins, ; Cyclin D1, ; Doxorubicin, ; Fibronectins, ; Micelles, ; Vimentin, ","","","Sichuan University Innovation Spark Project, (2018SCUH0089); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51973136)","This work was sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51973136 ) and the Sichuan University Innovation Spark Project ( 2018SCUH0089 ).

This work developed a novel three-dimensional concave lattice structure using a hyper-elastic soft photopolymer via the digital light processing technique. The axial low-velocity impact behaviors of the proposed structures were investigated by a drop hammer machine and numerical simulation. The results showed that the novel 3D concave structures could present continuous auxetic behaviors with large negative Poisson's ratios. The structural design parameters such as concave angle and thickness had significant effects on Poisson's ratio and energy absorption. Specifically, the structures with concave angles from 10° to 20° and with thicknesses from 0.5 mm to 1.0 mm presented the higher negative Poisson's ratio. The highest negative Poisson's ratio of −0.86 was obtained.

They have gained scientific attention in additive manufacturing (AM) field, and stainless steel products produced by AM find use in a wide array of applications. This study aims to evaluate the microstructure, the wear and corrosion resistances of a high-alloyed ferritic-induced stainless steel (FSS) obtained by laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), from a duplex stainless steel (DSS) precursor, SAF 2205, used to produce gas-atomized powders. No heat treatment was applied to the ferritic-induced L-PBF stainless steel to restore the duplex structure. The L-PBF FSS was dense and high alloyed with Cr, Mo, and N (pitting resistance equivalent number, PREn, ~33), presenting a negligible corrosion current density in the order of 10−7 A.cm−2, with an enlarged passivation window ~ 1.2 V with respect to the corrosion potential, restraining the current density at the passivation plateau below 10−4 A.cm−2. Also, double-loop electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation (DL-EPR) tests indicated unsensitized L-PBF FSS, with negligible degree of sensitization caused by the cyclic heat input during building up of the specimen. Besides be corrosion-resistant, the L-PBF FSS was hard (290 HV0.5) and wear-resistant against sliding wear, with a reduced specific wear rate of 5 × 10−4 mm3·N−1·m−1. The corrosion resistance of the L-PBF specimen (almost fully ferritic microstructure) was comparable to its hot-rolled precursor that displayed a duplex microstructure, albeit slight inferior. The L-PBF FSS was harder and more wear resistant than the DSS precursor. These results point out to the formation of a new high-alloyed ferritic-induced stainless steel, which are corrosion-resistant in chloride-rich medium and wear resistant in sliding conditions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Electrochemistry; Phase transition; Stainless steel; Tribology","3D printers; Additives; Chlorine compounds; Corrosion resistance; Electrochemistry; Ferrite; Microstructure; Passivation; Steel corrosion; Tribology; Wear of materials; 2205 duplex stainless steel; Corrosion and wear resistance; Corrosion-resistant; Ferritic; High-alloyed stainless steels; Laser powders; Manufacturing fields; Mechanical resistance; Powder bed; Wear-resistant; Wear resistance","","","","","Coordenaç ão de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal; Universal; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2019/05885–7); Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (407651/2021–7); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank the Brazilian institutions: Fundaç ão de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo/FAPESP (scholarship no 2019/05885–7), Coordenaç ão de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de N í vel Superior/CAPES (Finance code 001), and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico - Brasil/CNPq (Universal grant 407651/2021–7) for the financial support.

In this study, a synergistic grain-refining strategy including heterogeneous nucleation, solute-driven growth restriction and nanoparticle-induced growth restriction was introduced to control the microstructure of Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys during the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process. Crack-free Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys with significantly refined grains were safely fabricated via LPBF by coincorporation of TiC and TiH2 particles. In-situ L12-Al3Ti particles were produced to promote the heterogeneous nucleation. The grain growth was restricted by adding Ti solute, while introduced TiC nanoparticles (NPs) improved the density of heterogeneous nucleation sites and blocked grain growth physically. The resultant elimination of columnar grains and hot cracks in the (1 wt.%) TiC- and (0.8 wt.%) TiH2-modified Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy resulted in excellent ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 593 ± 24 MPa, yield strength (YS) of 485 ± 41 MPa and elongation (EL) of 10.0% ± 2.5% under the T6 condition. This study provides new insights into improving the grain microstructure and mechanical properties of high-strength aluminum alloys during LPBF. © 2022","Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy; Grain refinement; High-strength aluminum alloys; Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF)","Copper alloys; Cracks; Fabrication; Grain growth; Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; High strength alloys; Magnesium alloys; Microstructure; Nanoparticles; Nucleation; Refining; Tensile strength; Titanium carbide; Zinc alloys; Fusion process; Grain refining; Growth restriction; Heterogeneous nucleation; High strength aluminium alloys; Hot tearing; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; Strength and ductilities; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Major Special Project for Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province, (2014B010129002); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2019B090907001); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province","This work was financially supported by the Research and Development Program Project in Key Areas of Guangdong Province, China (No. 2019B090907001) and the Major Special Project for Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province, China (No. 2014B010129002).","Dursun T., Soutis C., Mater.

In addition, the influence of manufacturing parameters and different melting strategies, including multiple cycles of remelting, on printability and macro defects, such as pore and crack formation, have been investigated. Design/methodology/approach: An LPBF process was used to manufacture NiTi alloy from elementally blended powders and was evaluated with the use of a remelting scanning strategy to improve the homogeneity of fabricated specimens. Furthermore, both single melt and up to two remeltings were used. Findings: The results indicate that remelting can be beneficial for density improvement as well as chemical and phase composition homogenization. Backscattered electron mode in scanning electron microscope showed a reduction in the presence of unmixed Ni and Ti elemental powders in response to increasing the number of remelts. The microhardness values of NiTi parts for the different numbers of melts studied were similar and ranged from 487 to 495 HV. Nevertheless, it was observed that measurement error decreases as the number of remelts increases, suggesting an increase in chemical and phase composition homogeneity. However, X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the presence of multiple phases regardless of the number of melt runs. Originality/value: For the first time, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, elementally blended NiTi powders were fabricated via LPBF using remelting scanning strategies. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Elemental powders; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powder bed fusion (PBF); Nickel-titanium (NiTi); Nitinol; Premix powders; Remelting; Selective laser melting (SLM)","Binary alloys; Nickel; Phase composition; Remelting; Scanning; Scanning electron microscopy; Titanium alloys; X ray powder diffraction; Elemental powders; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Nickel-titania; Nickel-Titanium; Nitinol; Powder bed; Premix powder; Selective laser melting; Powders","","","","","American Centre of Polish Culture; Kosciuszko Foundation, KF; Ohio State University, OSU; Narodowe Centrum Nauki, NCN, (2017/25/B/ST8/01599); Narodowe Centrum Nauki, NCN","Funding text 1: Funding: The authors would like to thank the NCN (National Science Center) for providing financial support to project Synthesis and characterization of novel biomaterials based on 3D multifunctional titanium substrates (Grant No. 2017/25/B/ST8/01599).

With the objective of studying moisture diffusion into critical areas, such as the silicon-organic substrate interfaces of a flip chip plastic ball grid array (FC-PBGA), a multitude of impedance sensors sensitive to moisture are integrated inside the BEOL of a 17×17 mm silicon die. The sensors are read by a dedicated custom circuit that allows accurate characterization of the moisture with in situ spatial measurements. This article presents the results obtained by the experimental acquisition system on the FC-PBGA module under a high-relative humidity (RH) level of up to 75%. This study shows the moisture behavior of the multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) sensors inside the BEOL during absorption and desorption. The behavior initially follows Fick's law, with a constant increase in the RH. For long-term tests of more than 400 h, an asymptotic behavior is observed; when the concentration of a sensor reaches a value close to saturation, a two-dimensional finite-difference method (2D FDM) is used to estimate the saturation value. Thanks to the large number of sensors distributed on the BEOL, we first detect, during an absorption test, an increase in the RH. This increase is due, first of all, to a lateral moisture front with a constant velocity of about 90 μ m /h moving through the underfill. Then, after 30 h of storage, a more complex diffusion through the organic substrate occurs, affecting the BEOL.  © 2011-2012 IEEE.","Flip chip plastic ball grid array (FC-PBGA); long-term high-humidity storage; moisture diffusion; relative humidity (RH) sensors","Atmospheric humidity; Ball grid arrays; Chip scale packages; Diffusion; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Substrates; %moisture; Back end of lines; Flip chip; Flip chip plastic ball grid array; High humidity; Long-term high-humidity storage; Moisture diffusion; Organic substrate; Plastic ball grid arrays; Relative humidity sensors; Finite difference method","","","","","","","He Y., In-situ characterization of moisture absorption-desorption and hygroscopic swelling behavior of an underfill material, Proc.

As an emerging technology, 3D bioprinting enables tissue engineering through the ability to arrange biomaterials and cells in pre-ordered structures. Hydrogels, such as alginate (Alg), can be formulated as inks for 3D bioprinting. However, Alg has limited cell affinity and lacks the functional groups needed to promote cell growth. In contrast, graphene oxide (GO) can support numerous cell types and has been purported for use in regeneration of bone, neural and cardiac tissues. Here, GO was incorporated with 2% (w/w) Alg and 3% (w/w) gelatin (Gel) to improve 3D printability for extrusion-based 3D bioprinting at room temperature (RT; 25°C) and provide a 3D cellular support platform. GO was more uniformly distributed in the ink with our developed method over a wide concentration range (0.05%–0.5%, w/w) compared to previously reported GO containing bioink. Cell support was confirmed using adipose tissue derived stem cells (ADSCs) either seeded onto 3D printed GO scaffolds or encapsulated within the GO containing ink before direct 3D printing. Added GO was shown to improve cell-affinity of bioinert biomaterials by providing more bioactive moieties on the scaffold surface. 3D cell-laden or cell-seeded constructs showed improved cell viability compared to pristine (without GO) bio-ink-based scaffolds. Our findings support the application of GO for novel bio-ink formulation, with the potential to incorporate other natural and synthetic materials such as chitosan and cellulose for advanced in situ biosensing, drug-loading and release, and with the potential for electrical stimulation of cells to further augment cell function.

However, in times of COVID-19, most home-based elderly people did not have sufficient supplies or healthcare as usual. Fulfilling their desire for an independent lifestyle while protecting them from falls, sudden illness, or accidents is difficult. This study represents a smart system for coping with this problem in public healthcare. The existing methods for residential aged care (RAC), such as fall detection, focus on personal profiles and physical symptoms records or use a collaborative filtering method to notify caregivers or family members that the elderly person may be at a high level of risk. However, these methods have many limitations in times of COVID-19, including insufficient risk factors, problems gathering information from mobile sensors, and issues with handling human variability. This study proposes a new method for RAC in times of COVID-19 called the Intelligent Healthcare Agent System (IHAS), which, unlike the old system, incorporates context information, such as indoor and outdoor (IO), standing and lying (SL), and resting and moving (RM). IHAS integrates diverse mobile sensor data and utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into the research model and learning-oriented prototype system that can manage human variability. Ultimately, this study’s findings should contribute to the existing research and industrial applications of RAC, as well as offer new avenues of study in future research. © 2022 by the authors.","COVID-19; fall detection; human variability; mobile sensors; residential aged care","","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST; National Science and Technology Council, NSTC, (MOST 108-2410-H-033-002, MOST 111-2410-H-033-010)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (National Science and Technology Council), Taiwan, under grant MOST 108-2410-H-033-002 and MOST 111-2410-H-033-010.

Additive manufacturing techniques, such as laser powder bed fusion, have been utilized and aim towards further optimization of their mechanical properties. However, processing challenges exist for these promising alloys, mainly due to their crack susceptibility as recently shown in the Co-free Al-Cr-Fe-Ni alloy. In this study, gas atomized prealloyed powder of a baseline Al-Cr-Fe-Ni high-entropy alloy was mixed with Fe and Ni elemental fine powder particles, to produce a powder blend with a modified composition. It was aimed to improve the alloy processability via designing the solidification path by reducing the Al content. The synthesized novel alloy composition was processed by laser powder bed fusion and crack-free material with a metastable, near single-phase face-centered cubic microstructure was obtained. Process parameters for minimum porosity were identified and net-shape tensile specimens were produced. Heat treatment led to a refined dual-phase microstructure consisting of face-centered cubic and body-centered cubic phases with promising mechanical properties, such as high tensile strength, reasonable elongation and notable strain hardening. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Heat treatment; High-entropy alloys; Laser powder bed fusion; Mechanical properties","Aluminum alloys; Blending; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Cracks; Crystal structure; Entropy; High strength alloys; High-entropy alloys; Iron alloys; Microstructure; Nickel alloys; Strain; Strain hardening; Tensile strength; Cr-Fe-Ni; Elemental powders; Face-centred cubic; High entropy alloys; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; Powder process; Prealloyed powder; Process parameters; Heat treatment","","","","","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (03XP0163D)","This research was funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research ( Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung – BMBF ) under grant number 03XP0163D in the frame of the M-era.Net Joint Call 2017, Project NADEA (no. 5129 ).

Traditionally, load identification is carried out after extracting handcrafted features from electrical signals followed by classification algorithms, which is laborious and time consuming. To nullify the abovementioned shortcomings, this article proposes a 1-D convolutional neural network (CNN) with sinusoidal kernel initializers for classification of domestic appliances operating individually or in combination with other devices. For efficient operation, 15 primary and 225 multiscale sinusoidal kernels (MSK) are formed and included in the CNN architecture for extracting important discriminative features from the current signals. Classification accuracy of the proposed CNN module, named as MSK-CNN, is further improved by adding a new nonlinear activation function (AF), SL-ReLU, having an adjustable logarithmic function along with softsign and ReLU functions. The efficacy of MSK-CNN is tested on a practical dataset, created by the authors, consists current signals of different real life residential appliances. It is showed that MSK-CNN can successfully distinguish 18 single and 12 appliance combinations, and can attain an accuracy of 98.61%. The experimental outcomes reveal superiority of the MSK-CNN over classical CNN modules with other kernel initializers and AFs in terms of classification accuracy and training convergence.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Convolutional neural network (CNN); current signals; residential load identification; sinusoidal initializers","Convolution; Electric utilities; Housing; Neural networks; Phase shift keying; Convergence; Convolutional neural network; Current signal; Features extraction; Initializers; Kernel; Load identification; Residential load identification; Residential loads; Sinusoidal initializer; Domestic appliances","","","","","","","Building sector energy consumption, International Energy Outlook, pp. 101-112, (2016); Paul S., Padhy N.P., Real-time bilevel energy management of smart residential apartment building, IEEE Trans.

The influence of the placement of single or dual blow screens on the performance of the parts quality was also studied. Through scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive spectrometer, high-speed photography and other methods, the influence mechanism was explained.

The authors have highlighted the potential research gap that can be explored in the current field of study. Three-dimensional (3D) printing is an additive manufacturing technique that uses metallic powder, ceramic or polymers to build simple/complex parts. The parts produced possess good strength, low weight and excellent mechanical properties and are cost-effective. Therefore, efforts have been made to make the adoption of 3D printing successful in space so that complex parts can be manufactured in space. This saves a considerable amount of both time and carrying cost. Thereof the challenges and opportunities that the space sector holds for additive manufacturing is worth reviewing to provide a better insight into further developments and prospects for this technology. Design/methodology/approach: The potentiality of 3D printing for the manufacturing of various components under space conditions has been explained. Here, the authors have reviewed the details of manufactured parts used for zero-gravity missions, subjected to onboard international space station conditions and with those manufactured on earth. Followed by the major opportunities in 3D printing in space which include component repair, material characterization, process improvement and process development along with the new designs. The challenges like space conditions, availability of power in space, the infrastructure requirements and the quality control or testing of the items that are being built in space are explained along with their possible mitigation strategies. Findings: These components are well comparable with those prepared on earth which enables a massive cost saving. Other than the onboard manufacturing process, numerous other components as well as a complete robot/satellite for outer space applications were manufactured by additive manufacturing. Moreover, these components can be recycled onboard to produce feedstock for the next materials. The parts produced in space are bought back and compared with those built on earth. There is a difference in their nature, i.e. the flight specimen showed a brittle nature, and the ground specimen showed a denser nature. Originality/value: This review discusses the advancements of 3D printing in space and provides numerous examples of the applications of 3D printing in space and space applications. This paper is solely dedicated to 3D printing in space. It provides a breakthrough in the literature as a limited amount of literature is available on this topic.

First, an analysis was conducted for a comparison of recycled and virgin powders; it revealed that the powders have the same shape and phase and chemical composition. The only significant differences were the slightly increased average particle size and higher oxygen content in the recycled powder, especially on the powder surface. Typical molten pools were found in the microstructure, and a fine cellular type of structure was observed. The peripheral areas of the molten pools contained coarser cells with an average size of 0.6 μm2, and the middle part of the molten pools contained finer cells with an average size of 0.17 μm2. Fine Si precipitates with an average size of 25 nm were observed inside the cells. In terms of microstructure, no significant differences were observed when compared to the published data relating to SLM using virgin powders. This suggests that recycled powder after 30 printing cycles can be utilized for SLM component preparation to achieve cost-effectiveness. However, comparison of products with the use of virgin and recycled powders showed that the use of recycled powder affects the submicron characteristics (precipitate size increase), density and the resulting mechanical properties. Artificial aging of samples from the recycled powder at 170 °C caused an increase in hardness, Young's modulus and strength, while ductility remained essentially the same after aging. Peak values of hardness and strength were determined after 6 h of artificial aging. The increase in strength of the prepared samples can be explained by the precipitation of fine Si particles and their coarsening inside the cells. However, after longer aging times, the precipitates continued to coarsen, coalesced and displayed a plate-like shape, which led to the reduction in strength. The residual stress measured by the bridge curvature method (BCM) showed a significant decrease with increasing artificial aging time. The lowest residual stress was determined for an aging time of 100 h; however, the difference between residual stress for 6–7 h and 100 h was not significant. In order to obtain higher strengths and remove internal stresses after SLM during one heat treatment, the most suitable time for artificial aging at 170 °C seems to be 6 h. © 2022 The Authors","Aging; AlSi10Mg; Precipitation; Recycled powder; Residual stress; Selective laser melting; Tensile test","Biomechanics; Cells; Chemical analysis; Coarsening; Cost effectiveness; Cytology; Density (specific gravity); Elastic moduli; Hardness; Melting; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Precipitation (chemical); Recycling; Residual stresses; Selective laser melting; Tensile testing; Yield stress; Aging time; Artificial ageing; Average particle size; Average size; Chemical compositions; Molten pool; Printing cycle; Recycled powder; Selective laser melting; Tensile test; Powders","","","","","European Commission, EC, (19-03282S); Grantová Agentura České Republiky, GA ČR","The study was done in connection with project “Innovative and additive manufacturing technology: new technological solutions for 3D printing of metals and composite materials”, reg. no.

Firstly, the conformal array achieves a low profile of 0.11λLow by using the tightly coupling mechanism. Here, the gap-induced element resonance (GIER) and the common mode resonance occur in the operating band, limiting the impedance bandwidth. Thus, the resistors are loaded to eliminate the GIER by suppressing the resonant current. Furthermore, the shorting posts are used to remove the common mode resonance by decreasing the resonant length. A transition structure between the stripline (SL) and the ground coplanar waveguide (GCPW) is designed to feed the antenna. The simulated results show that the array achieves a 9:1 bandwidth (2–18 GHz) for active VSWR <2.5 at broadside. Besides, the active VSWR is less than 2.5 for ±60° scanning in E-plane and 3.8 for ±45° scanning in H-plane. A 12 × 8 array prototype is fabricated and measured to validate the performance of the array. The measured results show a good agreement with the simulation. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","balanced antipodal Vivaldi antenna; conformal phased array; resistive load; wideband","Bandwidth; Coplanar waveguides; Electric impedance; Microwave antennas; Resonance; Antipodal Vivaldi antenna; Balanced antipodal vivaldi antenna; Commonmode; Conformal arrays; Conformal phased arrays; Phased array antennas; Resistive loads; Shorting posts; Vivaldi; Wide-band; Antenna phased arrays","","","","","Stable Support of Defense Technology and Industry Agency; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61871088, 62101110)","Funding text 1: Stable Support of Defense Technology and Industry Agency; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 61871088, 62101110 Funding information ; Funding text 2: This work is supported in part by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 61871088 and 62101110, and in part by the Stable Support of Defense Technology and Industry Agency.

In education, laboratory safety is an essential component of undergraduate laboratory classes. The institution provides formal training for the students working in the labs that involve potential exposure to a wide range of hazards, including chemical, biological, and physical agents. During the laboratory safety lessons, the instructor explains the lab safety protocols and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent unwanted accidents. However, it is not always guaranteed that students follow safety procedures throughout all lab sessions. Currently, the lab supervisors monitor the use of PPE, which is time consuming, laborious, and impossible to see each student. Consequently, students may unintentionally commit unrecognizable unsafe acts, which can lead to unwanted situations. Therefore, the aim of the research article was to propose a real-time smart vision-based lab-safety monitoring system to verify the PPE compliance of students, i.e., whether the student is wearing a mask, gloves, lab coat, and goggles, from image/video in real time. The YOLOv5 (YOLOv5l, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5n, YOLOv5s, and YOLOv5x) and YOLOv7 models were trained using a self-created novel dataset named SLS (Students Lab Safety). The dataset comprises four classes, namely, gloves, helmets, masks, and goggles, and 481 images, having a resolution of 835 × 1000, acquired from various research laboratories of the United Arab Emirates University. The performance of the different YOLOv5 and YOLOv7 versions is compared based on instances’ size using evaluation metrics such as precision, F1 score, recall, and mAP (mean average precision). The experimental results demonstrated that all the models showed promising performance in detecting PPE in educational labs. The YOLOv5n approach achieved the highest mAP of 77.40% for small and large instances, followed by the YOLOv5m model having a mAP of 75.30%. A report detailing each student’s PPE compliance in the lab can be prepared based on data collected in real time and stored in the proposed system. Overall, the proposed approach can be utilized to make laboratories smarter by enhancing the efficacy of safety in research settings; this, in turn, will aid the students in establishing a health and safety culture among students. © 2022 by the authors.","deep learning; IoT; object detection; PPE compliance; safety; smart academic laboratories; YOLOv5","Humans; Laboratories; Personal Protective Equipment; Safety Management; Schools; Students; Chemical hazards; Compliance control; Deep learning; Internet of things; Monitoring; Protective clothing; Research laboratories; Students; Academic laboratory; Deep learning; IoT; Lab safety; Objects detection; Personal protective equipment; Personal protective equipment compliance; Real- time; Smart academic laboratory; YOLOv5; human; laboratory; protective equipment; safety; school; student; Object detection","","","","","","","Wu T.-C., Liu C.-W., Lu M.-C., Safety Climate in University and College Laboratories: Impact of Organizational and Individual Factors, J.

In this work, a novel nano-oxides dispersion strengthened Co28Cr9W1.5Si (wt.%) alloy, fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), was comprehensively investigated. During the layer-by-layer featured process, in-situ formation of Si rich, amorphous, nano-oxide inclusions was observed, whose formation is ascribed to the high affinity of Si to oxygen. Meanwhile, distinctive body-centered cubic (BCC) Co5Cr3Si2 nano-precipitates with an 8-fold symmetry were also confirmed to appear. The precipitates, rarely reported in previous studied Co-Cr alloys, were found to tightly bond with the in-situ oxidization. Furthermore, the morphologies, the size distributions as well as the microstructure of the interface between the matrix and the inclusions were investigated in detail and their influence on the tensile deformation was also clarified. The existence of transition boundaries between these inclusions and the matrix strongly blocked the movement of dislocations, thereby increasing the strength of the alloy. It was understood that when the plastic deformation proceeds, the fracture occurs in the vicinity of the oxide inclusions where dislocations accumulate. A quantitative analysis of the strengthening mechanism was also established, in which an additional important contribution to strength (∼ 169 MPa) caused by the effects of in-situ formed oxide inclusions was calculated. © 2022","Co-Cr-W-Si alloy; Oxide inclusion; Precipitation; Selective laser melting; Strengthening mechanisms","Additives; Amorphous silicon; Binary alloys; Chromium alloys; Chromium compounds; Melting; Precipitation (chemical); Selective laser melting; Silicon alloys; Silicon compounds; Tungsten alloys; In-situ oxidation; matrix; Nano-oxides; Non-equilibrium solidification; Novel materials; Oxide inclusion; Selective laser melting; Solidification process; Strengthening effect; Strengthening mechanisms; Cobalt alloys","","","","","Guangdong Academy of Science Fund, (2020GDASYL-20200101001); Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research, (2020B0301030006); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51701171, 51871132); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Guangdong Academy of Sciences, GDAS","Funding text 1: This research is supported by Guangdong Academy of Science Fund (No. 2020GDASYL-20200101001), Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research (No. 2020B0301030006) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51871132 and 51701171 ). ; Funding text 2: This research is supported by Guangdong Academy of Science Fund (No. 2020GDASYL-20200101001), Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research (No. 2020B0301030006) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51871132 and 51701171).

This has made physical and/or chemical postprocessing techniques essential for metal AM devices, although limited fundamental knowledge is available on how alterations in physicochemical properties influence AM biological outcomes. For this purpose, herein, powder bed fusion Ti-6Al-4V samples were postprocessed with three industrially relevant techniques: polishing, passivation, and vibratory finishing. These surfaces were thoroughly characterized in terms of roughness, chemistry, wettability, surface free energy, and surface ζ-potential. A significant increase in Staphylococcus epidermidis colonization was observed on both polished and passivated samples, which was linked to high surface free energy donor γ-values in the acid-base, γABcomponent. Early osteoblast attachment and proliferation (24 h) were not influenced by these properties, although increased mineralization was observed for both these samples. In contrast, osteoblast differentiation on stainless steel was driven by a combination of roughness and chemistry. Collectively, this study highlights that surface free energy is a key driver between AM surfaces and cell interactions. In particular, while low acid-base components resulted in a desired reduction in S. epidermidis colonization, this was followed by reduced mineralization. Thus, while surface free energy can be used as a guide to AM device development, optimization of bacterial and mammalian cell interactions should be attained through a combination of different postprocessing techniques. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

The compressive strength and permeability of porous scaffolds decreases with the increase of period number or the decrease of porosity variation magnitude, which is attributed to the variable gradient strategies reasonably adjusting the material distribution and aggregation degree of porous scaffolds. © 2022","3D printing; Biomaterials; Metals and alloys","Elastic moduli; High strength alloys; Metallurgy; Scaffolds; Selective laser melting; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Design goal; Elastic modulus strengths; High-strength; Low elastic modulus; Metals and alloys; Porous scaffold; TC4 alloys; Variable gradient; Compressive strength","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (51801115); National Science Foundation, NSF","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial supports provided by National Science Foundation (Grant No. 51801115).","Wang S., Shi Z.A., Liu L.L., Zhou X., Zhu L.C., Hao Y.Q., Mater.

The existing methods involve applying various optimization techniques to increase the performance of the partial transmit sequence (PTS) and OFDM system to reduce the peak average to power ratio (PAPR). This research proposes prime learning ant lion optimization (PL-ALO) method to reduce the PAPR and bit error rate (BER) of the system. The tournament selection technique is applied to increase the exploitation related to the best fitness agent that improves the PL-ALO model performance. The tournament selection technique randomly performs tournaments among the best fitness search agent in the system. The square-root raised cosine (SRC) precoding and Mu law companding techniques were applied to improve the efficiency of the system. The comparison between discrete cosine transform (DCT) and fast fourier transform (FFT) techniques was carried out in the performance analysis. The DCT-based method has higher efficiency than FFT-based techniques in the system. The PL-ALO method has higher efficiency than existing techniques of particle swarm optimization (PSO)- grey wolf optimization (GWO) and multi-objective mayfly algorithm (MOMA). The average PAPR of selective mapping (SLM) is 8.243, PTS-ant lion optimization (ALO) is 3.962, MAMO is 5.279, PSO-GWO is 5.854, and PL-ALO is 3.099 © 2022.

A preconcentration and analysis technique, static headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SHS-GC-MS), is demonstrated for the analysis of volatile compounds liberated from fused deposition modeling (FDM) and stereolithography (SLA) 3D printed models under elevated temperatures. Design/methodology/approach: A total of seven commercial 3D printing materials were tested using the SHS-GC-MS approach. The printed model mass and mass loss were examined as a function of FDM printing parameters including printcore temperature, model size and printing speed, and the use of SLA postprocessing procedures. A high temperature resin was used to demonstrate that thermal degradation products can be identified when the model is incubated under high temperatures. Findings: At higher printing temperatures and larger model sizes, the initial printed model mass increased and showed more significant mass loss after thermal incubation for FDM models. For models produced by SLA, the implementation of a postprocessing procedure reduced the mass loss at elevated temperatures. All FDM models showed severe structural deformation when exposed to high temperatures, while SLA models remained structurally intact. Mass spectra and chromatographic retention times acquired from the high temperature resin facilitated identification of eight compounds (monomers, crosslinkers and several photoinitiators) liberated from the resin. Originality/value: The study exploits the high sensitivity of SHS-GC-MS to identify thermal degradation products emitted from 3D printed models under elevated temperatures. The results will aid in choosing appropriate filament/resin materials and printing mechanisms for applications that require elevated temperatures. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Fused deposition modeling; Static headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; Stereolithography; Thermal testing","Degradation; Deposition; Gas chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Stereolithography; Volatile organic compounds; Elevated temperature; Headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; Highest temperature; Mass loss; Model size; Post-processing procedure; Static headspace; Static headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; Temperature modeling; Thermal testing; Resins","","","","","Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program; National Science Foundation, NSF, (CHE-1709372)","J.L.A. acknowledges funding from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program at the National Science Foundation (Grant No. CHE-1709372).

In the study, a combination of hollow brick (HB), red clay brick (RCB), roof tile (RT), concrete waste (CW) and glass waste (GW) obtained from various demolition sites and different combinations of alkaline activators including sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) were used for geopolymerization. CW was also used as fine aggregate in geopolymer mortar production. Specimens were subjected to ambient curing conditions until testing ages. Direction-dependent mechanical performance of printed specimens was evaluated at 7-, 28- and 90-day via compressive strength test in three different loading directions of perpendicular, parallel, and lateral to the printing path and flexural strength test in two different loading directions of perpendicular and lateral to the printing path. Moreover, bond strength between the consecutive printed layers were tested through direct and splitting tensile strength tests at the end of 7-, 28- and 90-day ambient curing and used to compare the directional performance of tested mixtures. In addition, compressive and flexural strength test results of printed specimens were compared with those of conventional mold-casted specimens. Results showed that alkaline activator content affects the mechanical properties considerably. According to compressive and flexural strength test results, 3D-printed geopolymer mortar specimens have anisotropic behavior and the bond performance between consecutive layers is one of the main influencing parameters for the anisotropic behavior of 3D-printed structures. However, perpendicular-loaded 3D-printed specimens showed similar or slightly better performance compared to the mold-casted ones, indicating that the bond zone had little influence on the performance of specimens loaded in perpendicular loading direction. This study pointed out that the anisotropic performance of printed structures can be diminished with the enhanced bond adhesion between consecutive layers and the adhesion can be improved by optimizing the rheological properties and matrix performance of the mixtures. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3D-printing; Alkaline content; Anisotropy; Bond strength; Construction and demolition waste (CDW); Geopolymer","3D printers; Anisotropy; Bending strength; Bond strength (materials); Brick; Compressive strength; Curing; Geopolymers; Hydrated lime; Inorganic polymers; Lime; Mixtures; Molds; Mortar; Tensile strength; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Alkaline content; Alkalines; Bond strength; Construction and demolition waste; Geopolymer; Performance; Strength tests; Sodium hydroxide","","","","","Scientific and Technical Research Council; Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu, TÜBİTAK, (119M630, 119N030); Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu, TÜBİTAK","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial assistance of the Scientific and Technical Research Council (TUBITAK) of Turkey provided under Project: 119M630 and 119N030 .","Bock T., The future of construction automation: technological disruption and the upcoming ubiquity of robotics, Autom.

To enrich the variety of SLM-fabricated austenitic SSs and develop some SSs which possess desired properties and cost, an austenite-rich composite of stainless steels was fabricated by SLM of a powder mixture composed of 310 S and 430 SSs. The effect of laser energy density on the defects, microstructure and mechanical properties of materials was investigated. At an appropriate energy density (89.3 J/mm3), samples exhibited the best ultimate tensile strength (∼701 MPa) and elongation to failure (∼46.6%). However, the occurrence of strong keyholing and spattering phenomena severely weakened the tensile properties of samples at the highest energy density (113.6 J/mm3). For all samples, their microstructure was mainly composed of lots of austenite phase and some delta (δ) ferrite phase. The existence of ultra-fine sub-grains surrounded by dislocation networks played an important role in the tensile properties of samples. Particularly, the formation of fine δ-ferrite at grain boundaries of austenite could hamper the growth of austenite grains, and lots of dislocations are formed at the interface between austenite and δ-ferrite. The existence of δ-ferrite with a circular flow feature could inhibit the epitaxial growth of austenite grains. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Austenitic stainless steels; Mechanical properties; Microstructure analysis; Selective laser melting","Additives; Austenite; Density (specific gravity); Ferrite; Grain boundaries; Melting; Microstructure; Mixtures; Selective laser melting; Tensile strength; 430 stainless steels; Austenite grain; Defect microstructure; High-strength; Laser energy density; Microstructures analysis; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Powder mixtures; Property; Selective laser melting; Austenitic stainless steel","","","","","Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2022R1A2C3011968); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work was supported by the Technology Innovation Program ( 20013794 , Center for Composite Materials and Concurrent Design) funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE, KOREA) , and the National Research Foundation of Korea ( NRF ) grant funded by the Korea government ( MSIT ).

In contrast to related papers in the literature, several numerical approximations to solve the mathematical model were used. The finite difference method (FDM), employing the spatial approximations given by the methods of Roberts and Weiss, Leith, upwind difference scheme (UDS), central difference scheme (CDS) and UDS with deferred correction (UDS-C), combined with the explicit, implicit and Crank-Nicolson temporal formulations was applied. The effective order of the discretisation error achieved with the refinement of the mesh was verified by performing an error analysis for all approximations used. In addition, the results obtained numerically were compared to the analytical solution and the CPU (central processing unit) times at different levels of refinement. The difference in the CPU time using the methods CDS - Crank-Nicolson, Roberts and Weiss, and Leith, was very small compared to the method widely used in literature, the UDS - Explicit. It was also verified that the errors obtained by the proposed methods were considerably smaller than the error obtained by the UDS - Explicit method. In light of the above, the Leith method is recommended to numerically solve the grain mass aeration model proposed by Thorpe. © 2022 IAgrE","Artificial viscosity; Crank-Nicolson; Grain storage; Leith;

Design/methodology/approach: The presented numerical model is investigated under various fidelity with varying computational complexity. To this end, comparisons between the Newtonian, non-newtonian, isothermal and non-isothermal computational models are presented for the extrusion of polylactic acid material in an FFF process. The computational model is validated through an experimental study on an off-the-shelf FFF printer. Microscope images of experimentally printed FFF bead cross-sections corresponding to various printing conditions are digitally processed for the validation. In the experimental study, common practical printing conditions for an FFF process are tested, and the results are compared to the numerical model. Findings: Microscope image analyses of the cross-sectional geometries of deposited beads show that the numerical model provides a precise characterization of the cross-sectional geometry under varying process parameters in terms of the cross-section outline, bead height and width. The results show that the nozzle-to-table distance has a great effect on the bead shape when compared to the extrusion rate at a given nozzle-to-table distance. Comparison of the various computational models show that the non-Newtonian isothermal model provides the best tradeoff between computational complexity and model accuracy. Originality/value: The authors provide detailed computational models, including the extruder nozzle geometry for cases ranging from Newtonian isothermal models to non-Newtonian non-isothermal models with experimental validation. The validation study is conducted for practical process parameters that are commonly used in FFF in practice and show that the computational models provide an accurate depiction of the true process outputs.

Classical lamination theory (CLT), the simplest model for composite laminates, has been proved successful for describing the stiffness properties of FDM parts, while strength modeling so far has been limited to unidirectional lay-ups. The aim of this paper is to show that CLT can be used to predict also FDM part failure. Design/methodology/approach: Wood flour-filled polyester has been chosen as a model material. Unidirectional specimens oriented at 0°, 90° and ± 45° have been first characterized in simple tension to obtain the properties of the single layer. Next, two quasi-isotropic lay-ups, possessing different layer sequences, have been tested again in simple tension for CLT validation. Findings: The measured properties are in good agreement with theoretical predictions, both for stiffness and strength, and an even better agreement can be achieved if a correction for taking the contour lines into account is implemented. Originality/value: The paper shows that also the tensile strength of FDM parts can be predicted by using a mathematical model based on CLT. This opens up the possibility of using CLT for studying optimization of raster filled lay-ups, for example in terms of the best raster angles sequence, to better resist applied external loads. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Fused deposition modelling;

Composites can no longer just be layered or disorderly mixed as before. This paper aims to introduce a new algorithm for dual-material 3D printing design. Design/methodology/approach: A novel topology design method: solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) for hybrid lattice structure is introduced in this paper. This algorithm extends the traditional SIMP topology optimization, transforming the original 0–1 optimization into A–B optimization. It can be used to optimize the spatial distribution of bi-material composite structures. Findings: A novel hybrid structure with high damping and strength efficiency is studied as an example in this work. By using the topology method, a hybrid Kagome structure is designed. The 3D Kagome truss with face sheet was manufactured by selective laser melting technology, and the thermosetting polyurethane was chosen as filling material. The introduced SIMP method for hybrid lattice structures can be considered an effective way to improve lattice structures’ stiffness and vibration characteristics. Originality/value: The fabricated hybrid lattice has good stiffness and damping characteristics and can be applied to aerospace components. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","3D Printing; Hybrid Material; Lightweight Structure; Topological design; Vibration","Damping; Design; Efficiency; Hybrid materials; Shape optimization; Stiffness; Topology; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; High damping; Hybrid lattice; Hybrid structure; Hybrids material; Lattice structures; Lightweight structures; Topological design; Vibration; 3D printers","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52005504); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Youth Science Fund Project (52005504).

However, the variety of the reported geometrical configurations of BNS metamaterials is relatively limited, and the study of systematically developing multidirectional buckling-based negative stiffness (MDBNS) metamaterials has rarely been seen at present, especially their mechanical performance. Therefore, the novelty of this study is to design a systematic group of MDBNS metamaterials comprising flexible cosine curved beams and stiffened supporting frames based on Bravais lattices. The group contains 15 element members and has been classified into 5 categories including the 2D bi-directional, 2D tri-directional, 3D tri-directional, 3D quadri-directional, and 3D six-directional NS functional elements. The geometrical configurations of the proposed MDBNS functional elements are respectively constructed based on the systematic arrangement rule of the Bravais lattices that provides the design guidance for the systematic metamaterial group with a fixed number of group members. The mechanical performance of some typical functional elements with the most NS directions and the metamaterial lattices composed of the proposed MDBNS metamaterials have been verified via the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) with the periodic boundary condition (PBC), respectively, while the numerical study has been validated experimentally with 2D MDBNS functional elements via 3D additive manufacturing. The results strongly prove the mechanical NS effects of the proposed MDBNS metamaterials and also indicate that the mechanical behavior is independent if the NS directions are orthogonal, whereas it interacts with each other in the case of non-orthogonal NS directions. The study can also be adopted to develop multidirectional NS metamaterials with other NS functional components and induced mechanisms. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Bravais lattice; Buckling-based negative stiffness metamaterial; Functional element; Multidirectional; Periodic boundary condition","Boundary conditions; Compliant mechanisms; Curved beams and girders; Mechanisms; Metamaterials; Stiffness; Bravais lattices; Buckling-based negative stiffness metamaterial; Curved beams; Functional elements; Geometrical configurations; Mechanical performance; Multidirectional; Negative stiffness; Negative stiffness effects; Periodic boundary conditions; Buckling","","","","","Shanghai Postdoctoral Excellence Program, (2021200); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2021M692043)","The support provided to the first author by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2021M692043 ) and Shanghai Postdoctoral Excellence Program (No. 2021200 ) is gratefully acknowledged.

To identify an ideal combination of GelMA and HAMA for chondrogenesis, a novel, primary human chondrocyte COL2A1-Gaussia luciferase reporter system (HuCol2gLuc) was developed. With this non-destructive, high-throughput temporal assay, Gaussia luciferase is secreted from the cells and used as a proxy for measuring type II collagen production. GelMA:HAMA ratios were screened using the reporter system before proceeding to 3D bioprinting. This method is efficient, saving on time and materials, resulting in a streamlined process of biomaterial optimization. The screen revealed that the addition of HAMA to GelMA improved chondrogenesis over GelMA (15%) alone. Storage moduli were measured using dynamic mechanical analysis of the same GelMA:HAMA ratios and established an initial threshold for chondrogenesis of ∼30kPa. To determine if biomaterial storage moduli impact cell mobility, human primary chondrocytes transduced with green fluorescent protein (GFP) were 3D bioprinted in either 1:1 or 2:1 ratios with storage moduli of 32kPa and 57.9kPa, respectively. We found that reduced cell mobility, in the stiffer biomaterial, had higher type II collagen expression, than the softer material with more cell mobility. Finally, after 3D bioprinting with HuCol2gLuc cells we successfully identified an optimal combination (2:1) of GelMA:HAMA and photo-crosslinking time (38s) for chondrogenesis. Statement of significance: One challenge of 3D bioprinting is identifying ideal biomaterials that stimulate articular cartilage development. To identify an optimal combination of gelatin methacrylate and hyaluronic acid methacrylate for chondrogenesis we developed a primary human chondrocyte type II collagen Gaussia luciferase reporter cell (HuCol2gLuc). This non-destructive, high-throughput assay uses a secreted Gaussia luciferase as a proxy for temporal type II collagen production. This reporter system streamlines the biomaterial optimization process before 3D bioprinting. We also used it to determine the level of stiffness required for chondrogenesis. And for the first time, we quantified chondrocyte mobility in a 3D bioprinted construct. Together these results indicate that a biomaterial with a higher storage modulus and less cell mobility, improves chondrogenesis. © 2022","Cartilage 3D bioprinting; Cell mobility; Chondrogenesis; Human primary chondrocyte reporter; Storage modulus","Biocompatible Materials; Bioprinting; Collagen Type II; Gelatin; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Humans; Hyaluronic Acid; Hydrogels; Methacrylates; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; Cartilage; Cells; Collagen; Crosslinking; Cytology; Elastic moduli; Organic acids; Stiffness; Storage (materials); Throughput; biomaterial; collagen type 2; complementary DNA; gelatin methacrylate; green fluorescent protein; hyaluronic acid methacrylate; hydrogel; hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase; luciferase; unclassified drug; biomaterial; collagen type 2; gelatin; green fluorescent protein; hyaluronic acid; methacrylic acid; Bioprinting; Cartilage 3d bioprinting; Cell mobility; Chondrogenesis; Human primary chondrocyte reporter; Luciferase reporter system; Non destructive; Primary chondrocytes; Primary human chondrocytes; Type II collagens; Article; cell aggregation; cell isolation; cell motility; cell viability; chondrocyte; chondrogenesis; collagen synthesis; controlled study; cross linking; gene expression; HEK293T cell line; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; microscopy; phenotype; protein expression; three dimensional printing; bioprinting; hydrogel; procedures; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; Hyaluronic acid","","hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, 9016-12-0; gelatin, 9000-70-8; hyaluronic acid, 31799-91-4, 9004-61-9, 9067-32-7; methacrylic acid, 18358-13-9, 79-41-4; Biocompatible Materials, ; Collagen Type II, ; Gelatin, ; Green Fluorescent Proteins, ; Hyaluronic Acid, ; Hydrogels, ; Methacrylates, ","","","DSHB; University of Central Florida Department of Research, (12259, 12260, Addgene_12259, Addgene_12260, II-II6B3); University of Central Florida, UCF; College of Medicine, University of Central Florida, COM, UCF","Funding text 1: Funding: This work was supported by the Rolanette and Berdon Lawrence Bone Disease Program of Texas; University of Central Florida; University of Central Florida College of Medicine; and the University of Central Florida Department of Research.

However, post-process heat treating could be considered an undesirable additional step. Thus, this study investigated the viability of in-situ heating by experimentally establishing the effect of in-situ heating on part properties. This was accomplished by incrementally increasing the laser-induced energy density (Ev) above the machine-default Ev while maintaining high part density> 99%. Microstructural changes were monitored using optical and scanning electron microscopy and quantified using X-ray and electron-backscatter diffraction analysis. The study found a decrease in α grain size with an increase in Ev, a full α' decomposition at an Ev of 167 J/mm3 and indications of prior-β grain columnar-to-equiaxed transition at higher Ev. Graded properties along the sample height, and an increase in oxygen and nitrogen pick-up was measured at high Ev, causing a decrease in material ductility. A discussion of the thermodynamics of the process parameters demonstrated the mechanisms by which a reduced laser hatch distance controls powder bed fusion texture. Process variables of interaction time and exposure rate are proposed to better quantify the interactions between process parameters and thermodynamics. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive Manufacturing; Deformation behaviour; Intrinsic heat treatments; Microstructure; Ti-6Al-4V","3D printers; Heat treatment; Scanning electron microscopy; Ternary alloys; Textures; Thermodynamics; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Deformation behavior; Heat treating; Intrinsic heat treatment; Laser powders; Post process; Powder bed; Process heat; Process parameters; Property; Ti-6al-4v; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Collaborative Program for Additive Manufacturing, (CPAM-21-SUN-01); Department of Science and Innovation; Department of Science and Innovation, South Africa, DSI","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the Department of Science and Innovation funding through the Collaborative Program for Additive Manufacturing ( CPAM ) The project number is CPAM-21-SUN-01 .

In this work, we demonstrated sustainable vat-photopolymerization (VPP)-based 3D printing in a whole life-cycle process by developing a renewable ink made of soybean oil and natural polyphenols and recycling the ink for reprinting or converting printed biocomposite to flash graphene (FG) as reinforcing nanofillers in the biocomposite. We also realized its applications in fabricating lightweight, materials-saving 3D structures, acoustic metamaterials, and disposable microreactors for time-saving and efficiency-improving synthesis of metal-organic framework nanostructures. In addition to enhancing the tensile strength and Young's modulus of the biopolymers by 42% and 232% with only 0.6 wt % FG nanofillers, respectively, FG improved the printability of the ink in forming 3D tubular structures, which are usually very hard to be achieved in transparent resin. Success of this work will inspire further development for sustainability in 3D printing. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

The novelty of the approach consists in accounting for the anisotropy in the material properties induced by the printing patterns. To do so we partition the manufactured structure according to the printing patterns used in a single component. For determining the material properties of each partition, a hybrid experimental/computational characterization is proposed. The external partitions with aligned (contour) and crossed (cover) filaments are characterized through uniaxial tensile tests on General Purpose Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene dog-bone samples with corresponding patterns. Characterization of the inner structure (infill/lattice) is done through computational homogenization technique using Representative Volume Element. The presented methodology is validated against experimental results of square cross-section demonstrators. It is shown that the material properties depend on the geometrical relationship of the different printing patterns, exclusively. Therefore, the exhaustive experimental procedure can be avoided characterizing the printed material by a pre-defined anisotropic constitutive relationship proportional to the properties of the raw material. Moreover, the acquired geometrical relationship is validated for components made of Polylactic Acid. The given methodology may be used as design-for-manufacture tool for creating functional components. © 2022 The Authors","Anisotropy; Fused Filament Fabrication; Hybrid methodology; Material characterization; Mechanical properties","Anisotropy; Homogenization method; Styrene; Tensile testing; Experimental strategy; Fused filament fabrication; Geometrical relationship; Hybrid methodologies; Manufactured structures; Materials characterization; Mechanical performance; Mechanical response; Numerical experimental; Single components; Fabrication","","","","","ACCIÓ, (PRO2 COMRDI16-1-0009-04, TRANSPORT COMRDI16-1-0010 - 00); CIMNE; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU, (PID2020-115575RB-I00); Generalitat de Catalunya; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO, (CEX2018-000797-S); Horizon 2020, (872570, H2020-DT-2019-1); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación Tecnológica, CONCYTEC, (163-2017-FONDECYT); Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, PUCP","Funding text 1: Financial supports from the European Union’s horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (H2020-DT-2019-1 No. 872570) under the KYKLOS 4.0 Project (An Advanced Circular and Agile Manufacturing Ecosystem based on rapid reconfigurable manufacturing process and individualized consumer preferences) and from the Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (MCIU) via: the PriMuS project (Printing pattern based and MultiScale enhanced performance analysis of advanced Additive Manufacturing components, ref. num.

In this study, we demonstrated that the yield strength can be estimated by the combination of the sizes and volume fractions of FMP, CMP, HAZ together with the second-phase hardening. Two different AlSi10Mg alloys fabricated via powder bed fusion (PBF) process were prepared to examine the lattice strain evolution of constituent phases during uniaxial tensile loading via in-situ neutron diffraction measurements. The horizontally-built (Hz-built) exhibited a much better yield and tensile strength as well as elongation compared to the vertically-built (Vt-built) AlSi10Mg alloy. The stress partitioning from Al matrix to reinforcement Si was obtained during plastic deformation regime in both alloys. However, a greater capability of enduring high load of Si and a load transferring back to the ductile Al matrix found in the latter period of plastic deformation are responsible for better tensile properties in the Hz-built AlSi10Mg alloy. We reported empirical strength quantification based on the sizes and ratios of FMP, CMP, and HAZ together with the possible failure mode to prevent early fracture in the additive manufactured alloys. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","AlSi10Mg alloy; Load transferring back; Mechanical properties; Neutron diffraction; Powder bed fusion","3D printers; Additives; Heat affected zone; Lakes; Neutron diffraction; Plastic deformation; Tensile strength; Alsi10mg alloy; Heat-affected zones; Load transferring; Load transferring back; matrix; Melt pool; Phase hardening; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion; Second phase; Alloys","","","","","Korean government, (2017M2A2A6A05017653, 2020R1I1A2070474, 2021R1A4A1031494); National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; Semiconductor Technology Research; Tongtai Machine & Tool Co.

However, the poor inter-layer bonding strength leads to serious anisotropy, which hinders the further application of FDM technology. In this paper, a self-developed print head that vibrates the nozzle vertically was used to study the possibility of improving the vertical tensile strength of FDM parts, and to seek the appropriate vibration frequencies. The polylactic acid (PLA) specimens were printed at five different vibration frequencies and in two directions (horizontal and vertical). The results show that different vibration frequencies lead to different surface structures and porosities. The vertical tensile strength was increased when the vibration frequency was high enough. Moreover, vibration did not affect the horizontal tensile strength of FDM parts. This research is significant to promote the application of FDM technology. © 2022","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Inter-layer bonding; Pore analysis; Vibration","Deposition; Fused Deposition Modeling; Layered manufacturing; Nozzles; Surface structure; Vibration analysis; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Different frequency; Inter-layer bonding; Inter-layers; Modeling technology; Nozzle vibrations; Pore analysis; Vibration; Vibration frequency; Tensile strength","","","","","Qingdao Research Institute of Sichuan University, (18GZ30201); Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program, (2018GZDZX0018)","The authors acknowledge the financial supports from the Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program (2018GZDZX0018) and Qingdao Research Institute of Sichuan University (contract number 18GZ30201).","Abbott A.C., Tandon G.P., Bradford R.L., Koerner H., Baur J.W., Process-structure-property effects on ABS bond strength in fused filament fabrication, Addit.

Thus, in this study, we utilize visible information as well as infrared imaging to detect the defects in PBF parts that conventional optical inspection technologies cannot easily detect. A multi-source image acquisition system was designed to simultaneously acquire brightness intensity and infrared intensity. Then, a multi-sensor image fusion method based on finite discrete shearlet transform (FDST), multi-scale sequential toggle operator (MSSTO), and an improved pulse-coupled neural networks (PCNN) framework were proposed to fuse information in the visible and infrared spectra to detect defects in challenging conditions. The image fusion performance of the proposed method was evaluated with different indices and compared with other fusion algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves satisfactory performance in terms of the averaged information entropy, average gradient, spatial frequency, standard deviation, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and structural similarity, which are 7.979, 0.0405, 29.836, 76.454, 20.078 and 0.748, respectively. Furthermore, the comparison experiments indicate that the proposed method can effectively improve image contrast and richness, enhance the display of image edge contour and texture information, and also retain and fuse the main information in the source image. The research provides a potential solution for defect information fusion and characterization analysis in multi-sensor detection systems in the PBF process.","defect detection; infrared imaging; multi-sensor image fusion; powder bed fusion; visible imaging","Algorithms; Diagnostic Imaging; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Neural Networks, Computer; Powders; algorithm; diagnostic imaging; image processing; powder; procedures","","Powders, ","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","14248220","","","36298369","English","Sensors (Basel)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140933217"

A class of such lightweight metamaterial is microlattice, which comprises of architected periodic arrangements of struts or plates. The recent advances in additive manufacturing aid in the fabrication of microlattice at a small length scale with high dimensional accuracy. This work proposes designs of two microlattices, namely tetrahedral and strut-reinforced tetrahedral (SRT), with high specific strength and high specific stiffness. The mechanical behavior of these microlattices was analyzed under quasi-static compressive loading using analytical, numerical and experimental methods and compared with widely studied BCC and BCCZ microlattices having similar architecture. All microlattices were fabricated from AlSi10Mg powder using a laser powder bed fusion technique of additive manufacturing. The strength and stiffness attained by the tetrahedral and the strut-reinforced tetrahedral microlattices were significantly higher than the conventional BCC and BCCZ microlattices of the same relative density, respectively. Two failure modes, i.e., shear failure and crushing, were observed in the microlattices. The orientations of the shear crack planes in the tetrahedral and the BCC microlattices and vertical strut assisted layerwise crushing in the SRT and the BCCZ microlattices were investigated. The focus of the study is to understand the design and mechanical behavior of the tetrahedral and the strut-reinforced tetrahedral microlattices, which can be useful for high-strength and high-stiffness applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Deformation behavior; Laser powder bed fusion; Metamaterial; Microlattice; Strut-reinforced tetrahedral; Tetrahedral","3D printers; Additives; Crushing; Numerical methods; Reinforcement; Stiffness; Struts; Deformation behavior; High stiffness; High-strength; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Microlattice; Powder bed; Strength and stiffness; Strut-reinforced tetrahedral; Tetrahedral; Metamaterials","","","","","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, UTM; Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, IITG","The authors acknowledge the DST-FIST funded facility, Shimadzu AGS-X 100 kN UTM, at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, and the FESEM facility at the Central Instruments Facility, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, for testing and characterization.","Rashed M.G., Ashraf M., Mines R.A.W., Hazell P.J., Metallic microlattice materials: a current state of the art on manufacturing, mechanical properties and applications, Mater.

Each of them were extracted from the vertical (V) and horizontal (H) section of the part, respectively. Methods such as OM, SEM, TEM, XRD and unidirectional tensile tests were used for the investigation. The AD sample displays cellular dendrite microstructures with <001> crystal direction parallel to the building direction. The major phases are γ/γ'; while the minor phases are fine MC and Laves with no more than 1% in volume fraction. The size of primary γ′ ranges from 100 nm to 150 nm, the secondary γ′ particles are no more than 30 nm. With the aid of calculation, the processing HT1 and HT2 are confirmed as ageing and sub-solution treatment, respectively. The former raised the volume fraction of γ′ from 30.93% (AD) to 48.57% (HT1), and raised the size of γ′ at the expense of dissolving the secondary γ′ particles. The latter didn't change the volume fraction of γ′ strikingly, but refined the γ′ with the exception of a small amount of extraordinary large particles in the interdendritic region (IR). HT3 is a two-stage processing (HT2+HT1) which increased the volume fraction of γ′ slightly but raised the size apparently. The value of ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and yield strength (YS) of vertical samples are superior to that of the horizontal. The HT1-V shows the best UTS and poor Elongation (UTS, 1082 MPa; EL, 35.28%), while the AD-V has excellent strength and ductility match (UTS, 1054 MPa; YS, 744 MPa; EL, 50.45%); The best ductility is found among samples of HT3 (EL, 62.1% for HT3-H). The samples of HT2-H are inferior in both strength and ductility, and the obtained properties are scattered. These investigation results provide important fundamental support for optimizing the procedure, microstructure and properties of the new alloy in the future application research. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Heat treatment; Laser metal deposition; Microstructure; Tensile","3D printers; Additives; Cooling; Deposition; Microstructure; Superalloys; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Volume fraction; Air cooling; Cellular dendrites; Effect of heat treatments; Laser metal deposition; Manufacturing IS; Strength and ductilities; Tensile; Ultimate tensile strength; Unidirectional tensile tests; XRD; Heat treatment","","","","","National Major Science and Technology Projects of China, (Y2019-VII-0011-0151); National Major Science and Technology Projects of China","The authors are grateful for financial support from National Science and Technology Major Project of China (Y2019-VII-0011-0151).

However, fabrication of such microdevices is costly and labor-intensive. Among conventional fabrication methods, photo-lithography provides high resolution but is expensive and time consuming, and not ideal for rapid prototyping and testing for academic applications. In this work, we demonstrate a highly efficient method for rapid prototyping of acoustic patterning devices using laser manufacturing. With this method we can fabricate a newly designed functional acoustic device in 4 hours.

Design/methodology/approach: Maxillary RPD framework specimens designed on a benchmark model were built. The process parameters, including contour scan speed and laser power, infill scan speed and laser power, hatch space, build orientation and metallic powder type, were arranged through the Taguchi design. Three-dimensional deviations of the clasps area, connector area and overall area of maxillary RPD frameworks were analyzed by using root mean square (RMS) as a metric. One-way analyses of variance with the above RMSs as the dependent variable were carried out (α = 0.05). Findings: Maxillary RPD frameworks built horizontally had a more accurate intaglio surface than those built at other orientation angles; CP Ti or Ti–6Al–4V maxillary RPD frameworks had a more accurate intaglio surface than Co–Cr ones; the Maxillary RPD framework built with a higher infill scan speed and lower infill laser power had the more accurate intaglio surface than the one built with other levels of these two process parameters. Originality/value: A novel benchmark model for evaluating the accuracy of the intaglio surface of maxillary RPD frameworks manufactured by SLM is proposed. The accuracy of the intaglio surface of maxillary RPD frameworks can be improved by adjusting SLM process parameters. The optimal setting of process parameters concerning the accuracy of the intaglio surface of maxillary RPD frameworks was given. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Accuracy; Maxillary removable partial denture frameworks; Process parameters; Selective laser melting","Chromium alloys; Infill drilling; Melting; Titanium alloys; Accuracy; Cobalt-chromium alloys; Commercially pure titanium; Laser melting process; Laser power; Maxillary removable partial denture framework; Process parameters; Removable partial denture; Scan speed; Selective laser melting; Selective laser melting","","","","","Beijing Training Project for the Leading Talents in S&T, (Z191100006119022); Capital’s Funds for Health Improvement and Research, (2022-2Z-4106); Open Fund of Shanxi Province Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases Prevention and New Materials, (KF2020-04); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51705006); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2019YFB1706900); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was supported by National Key R&D Program of China [2019YFB1706900], Capital’s Funds for Health Improvement and Research [2022-2Z-4106], Beijing Training Project for the Leading Talents in S&T [Z191100006119022], National Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [51705006], and Open Fund of Shanxi Province Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases Prevention and New Materials [KF2020-04].

Gaining control over the crystallinity within the desired structure, however, remains a challenge. We have developed a three-dimensional (3D) printing method that enables spatioselective programming of the crystallinity of diphenylalanine (FF) dipeptide microarchitectures. A femtoliter ink meniscus is used to spatially control reprecipitation self-assembly, enabling the printing of a freestanding FF microstructure with programmed shape and crystallinity. The self-assembly crystallization of FF can be switched on and off at will by controlling the evaporation of the binary solvent. The evaporation-dependent crystallization was theoretically studied by the numerical simulation of supersaturation fields in the meniscus. We found that a 3D-printed FF microarchitecture with spatially programmed crystallinity can carry a 3D digital optical anisotropy pattern, applicable to generating polarization-encoded anticounterfeiting labels. This crystallinity-controlled additive manufacturing will pave the new way for facilitating the creation of peptide-based devices.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.","3D Printing; Anticounterfeiting; Crystallinity; Dipeptides; Self-Assembly","Dipeptides; Peptides; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Solvents; 3D printers; Computer architecture; Crystallinity; Evaporation; Microstructure; Peptides; dipeptide; diphenylalanine; peptide; solvent; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Anti-counterfeiting; Cristallinity; Di-peptides; Micro architectures; Multilevels; Printing method; Three-dimensional (3D) printing; Three-dimensional-printing; chemistry; three dimensional printing; Self assembly","","Dipeptides, ; diphenylalanine, ; Peptides, ; Solvents, ","","","Seed Fund for Basic Research, (201910159047, 202111159097); University Research Committee, Emory University, URC; Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局; University of Hong Kong, HKU; General Research Fund of Shanghai Normal University, (17200222, 17204020, 17208218, 17208919); General Research Fund of Shanghai Normal University","This work was supported by the General Research Fund (17208218, 17208919, 17204020, and 17200222) from the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong; and Seed Fund for Basic Research (201910159047 and 202111159097) from University Research Committee (URC), The University of Hong Kong.","Reches M., Gazit E., Casting metal nanowires within discrete self-assembled peptide nanotubes, Science, 300, pp. 625-627, (2003); Adler-Abramovich L., Gazit E., The physical properties of supramolecular peptide assemblies: From building block association to technological applications, Chem.

The mechanical properties of parts manufactured by FFF are influenced by the printing parameters. The mechanical properties of rigid thermoplastics for FFF are well defined, while thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) are uncommonly investigated. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of extruder temperature, bed temperature and printing speed on the mechanical properties of a thermoplastic elastomer. Design/methodology/approach: Regression models predicting mechanical properties as a function of extruder temperature, bed temperature and printing speed were developed. Tensile specimens were tested according to ASTM D638. A 3×3 full factorial analysis, consisting of 81 experiments and 27 printing conditions was performed, and models were developed in Minitab. Tensile tests verifying the models were conducted at two selected printing conditions to assess predictive capability. Findings: Each mechanical property was significantly affected by at least two of the investigated FFF parameters, where printing speed and extruder temperature terms influenced all mechanical properties (p < 0.05). Notably, tensile modulus could be increased by 21%, from 200 to 244 MPa. Verification prints exhibited properties within 10% of the predictions. Not all properties could be maximized together, emphasizing the importance of understanding FFF parameter effects on mechanical properties when making design decisions. Originality/value: This work developed a model to assess FFF parameter influence on mechanical properties of a previously unstudied thermoplastic elastomer and made property predictions within 10% accuracy. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","3D printing;

Although cooling methods such as water or airflow is applied to enhance heat dissipation, the heat input regulation is a convenient and effective way to improve the processing quality. In this work, a novel temporal and spatial heat input regulation strategy is proposed for multi-beam laser micro-drilling to effectively suppress the local heat accumulation during the processing. The strategy consists of a scanning path planning model and an optimization method of key drilling parameters. The scanning path planning model is established based on the temperature field of the workpiece, which is dynamically calculated using a transient finite-difference method (FDM). In addition, an optimization method is proposed to match the drilling parameters with the designated scanning path. Via this heat input regulation strategy, a more homogeneous temperature distribution can be obtained in the multi-beam laser drilling of micro-hole arrays. The maximum temperature and duration of overheating that causes material oxidation are decreased by 10%, and 50%, respectively. With the realization of high-quality (recast-free) and high-throughput (2430 micro-holes in 210 s, or 12 micro-holes/s), the proposed strategy shows a promising prospect in the multi-beam drilling of micro-hole arrays and other laser processing with possible heat accumulation, such as large-area surface texture and precise engraving of micro-nano structures. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Heat regulation; Laser drilling; Laser fabrication; Multi-beam; Ultrafast laser","Fabrication; Finite difference method; Infill drilling; Nanostructures; Scanning; Textures; Ultrafast lasers; Heat input; Heat regulation; High-throughput; Laser drilling; Laser fabrication; Micro-drilling; Micro-hole arrays; Multibeams; Scanning path; Temporal and spatial; Motion planning","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52075287, 52105372)","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 52075287 , 52105372 ).

Therefore, to alleviate these supply and demand conflicts, watershed managers should search for optimal allocation strategies. Overall, there are two challenges in water resource allocation: the first one is the contradictions among various water sectors exacerbated by existed unfair water resource allocation; the second is the unification of wastewater emission permits and water resource allocation while considering economic, social, and environmental benefits. Based on this, a multi-objective optimization model for united allocation of water resources and wastewater emission licenses was proposed in this paper, which takes into account the maximizing of economic benefits per unit of wastewater emission. Applying this model, the balanced development of economic, social, and environmental benefits can be assured, and the equity of water resource allocation to alleviate the supply-demand contradiction can be maximized. An improved particle swarm optimization algorithm was designed to solve the nonlinear programming model and simulate the cooperative allocation scheme of water resources and wastewater emission permits under different preferences. The case study showed that the proposed model is realistic and sensible, and that watershed managers' preferences has an influence on the coordinated allocation strategy of water resources and wastewater emission permits. For example, the economic benefit differential between the basic trade-off scheme (BTS) and the economic benefit maximization scheme (EBM) is 95.39717 billion yuan, and the Gini coefficient between the BTS and the EMS falls from 0.3874 to 0.3627. The proposed model can successfully balance equity and economic benefits, and provide a reference for the construction of wastewater emission and water resource co-allocation systems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Equity; Multi-objective optimization; Wastewater emission permits; Water allocation","Economic and social effects; Economics; Managers; Multiobjective optimization; Nonlinear programming; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Resource allocation; Watersheds; Coordinated allocations; Economic benefits; Emission permits; Equity; Multi-objectives optimization; Wastewater emission permit; Wastewater emissions; Water allocations; Water resource allocation; Waters resources; Water resources","","","","","Fundamental Research Funds for the System science and enterprise development research center of Sichuan key research base of Social Sciences, (Xq21B11); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71771157)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71771157 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the System science and enterprise development research center of Sichuan key research base of Social Sciences (Grant No. Xq21B11 ).

These institutes provide calibration services, which links the measurement units to industrial and everyday measurements. This traceability is critical to overcome technical barriers to trade and industrialisation. Most African countries have such a designated institute that requires advanced scientific instrumentation. These instruments are custom-built for a specific application, hard to procure or sometimes obsolete. Servicing these instruments or obtaining spare parts are also difficult. The purpose aims to evaluate if three-dimensional (3D) printing can significantly improve this situation, by providing six institutes with a 3D printer and training. Design/methodology/approach: Therefore, a 3D printer pilot project was launched, involving six African metrology institutes, with the aim of developing the basic manufacturing capabilities of these institutes so that they can produce functional parts. The project included training on both digital part modelling and 3D printer usage. This case study reviews the technology selection method, project risks, needs, challenges and results, with the aid of research questions. Findings: The results of the project illustrate how additive manufacturing (AM) has started to enable metrology in Africa and how it can be expanded to the general scientific endeavour on the continent. Social implications: The success of this project can be used to motivate the further adoption of AM in African National Metrology Institutes, as well as other scientific institutes. Originality/value: The project is the first AM project of its kind for African National Metrology Institutes. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing; Fused deposition modelling; Fused filament fabrication; Metrology; Technology transfer","Additives; Printing presses; Technology transfer; Case-studies; Deposition modeling; Functional parts; Fused deposition modeling; Fused filament fabrication; Industrialisation; National metrology institutes; Spare parts; Technical barriers to trade; Three-dimensional (3D) printing; 3D printers","","","","","Calvin Bore; KEBS; Lusia Katanga; Munyaradzi Mubaiwa; SIRDC-NMI; Institute for Nanoscience, NSI","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the PTB, Cindy McFarlane for developing and presenting the CAD training course and Oelof Kruger for project concept and liaison with the PTB.

Nevertheless, understanding of interface characteristics of printed parts has remained an open research question for broader applications of this new technology in engineering practice. This study aimed to evaluate the interfacial quality of 3D-printed carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composites from two aspects: interlaminar fracture toughness in a pure mode and interfacial failure mechanism in a mixed mode. Prior to the experimental tests, the microstructural quality of the 3D printed specimens was characterized, which showed that the void content and shape of different materials are different. There is a clear boundary line where the short fiber matrix layer and the continuous fiber reinforced layer are in contact, while the interface formed between the same material layers has no evident connection traces. The standard specimens were printed for testing pure mode I and mode II interlaminar fracture toughness, through which the GΙC and GIIC of interface between continuous carbon fiber layers was characterized. It was found that the fiber bridging phenomenon presented in the double cantilever beam (DCB) experiments, resulting in a higher initial mode I fracture toughness. The end notched flexure (ENF) tests found that the fracture toughness of initial mode II in between the 0° continuous carbon fiber layers was relatively low. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis revealed that the separated surface had only a small area of the matrix being sheared. The single lap specimen printed directly was proposed as a simplified model for simulating complex structural parts subjected to mixed stress of peel and shear. The mechanical responses and failure characteristics of the interfaces composed of different materials and different fiber angles under mixed stress were studied. It is found that each specimen presented some mixed failure modes, and the interface characteristics of different materials and different fiber orientations were completely different. The results gained in-depth understanding on the interfacial properties of 3D printing fiber reinforced structures, thereby providing key data and knowledge for practical applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composite; Fracture toughness; Fused filament fabrication; Interlayer interface characteristics","3D printers; Cantilever beams; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Fabrication; Fibers; Fracture testing; Quality control; Scanning electron microscopy; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Carbon-fiber reinforced plastic composites; Continuous fibers; Fused filament fabrication; Interface characteristic; Interface failure; Interlaminar fracture toughness; Interlayer interface characteristic; Mode II; Fracture toughness","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52075157); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2021JJ30122); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 52075157 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities and Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province , China ( 2021JJ30122 ).","Hu C., Qin Q.-H., Advances in fused deposition modeling of discontinuous fiber/polymer composites, Curr.

Compared with that of a symmetrically localized three-beam array (SLA), the amplitude change in the GALA prototype is observed to be significantly increased by about 100% with the localized first mode. While two intersections, appeared in three amplitude curves with respect to mass perturbation, are believed to be capable of playing early mass warning functions. These indicate that gradient-asymmetrical coupling, changing the mechanism of energy transfer, shows different energy localization characteristics from a symmetrical one. A localization factor of characterizing the inhomogeneity in energy localization is found to monotonically decrease from 3.10 to 1.70 with the gap between support and overhang while monotonically increasing from 2.75 to 3.10 with the width of overhang, and thus overlapped at 2.90. This implies that a very similar localized state with the same localization factor might be achieved by adjusting different overhang geometry. An optimal gradient angle of 7° with the highest amplitude change, corresponding to the maximum energy localization rate under a coupling ratio of 2.76, is further theoretically observed in GALA. The proposed scheme is believed to be applicable to detecting and warning of gas leak, dust pollution, harmful chemicals, and other applications.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Gradient-asymmetrically localized three-beam array (GALA); high-sensitivity; localization factor; mass sensing; mass warning; symmetrically localized three-beam array (SLA)","Energy transfer; Perturbation techniques; Eigenvalue and eigenfunctions; Gradient-asymmetrically localized three-beam array; High sensitivity; Localised; Localization factor; Location awareness; Mass sensing; Mass warning; Mechanical sensors; Perturbation method; Sensitivity; Sensor phenomenon and characterizations; Symmetrically localized three-beam array (SLA); Three beams; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","","","","","","","Gil-Santos E., Ramos D., Jana A., Calleja M., Raman A., Tamayo J., Mass sensing based on deterministic and stochastic responses of elastically coupled nanocantilevers, Nemo Lett., 9, 12, pp. 22-421, (2009); Wang D.F., Chatani K., Ikehara T., Maeda R., Observation of localised vibration modes in a micromechanical oscillator trio with coupling overhang for highly sensitive mass sensing, Micro Nemo Lett., 7, 8, pp. 713-716, (2012); Wang D.F., Zhou D., Liu S., Hong J., Quantitative identification scheme for multiple analytes with a mode-localized cantilever array, IEEE Sensors J., 19, 2, (2019); Spletzer M., Raman A., Wu A.Q., Xu X., Reifenberger R., Ultrasensitive mass sensing using mode localization in coupled micro-cantilevers, Appl.

The open-circuit potentials, polarization curves, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were measured and compared. The results demonstrated that the corrosion resistance of SLM-produced Ti-2.5TiB composite possesses is better than that of the SLM-produced Ti-2.5TiN and CP-Ti samples after immersion for 0 day (without immersion). Due to tiny TiB and TiB2 particles acting as the micro-cathode in the titanium matrix, anodic dissolution of the titanium matrix was prominently facilitated in the early corrosion stage, followed by rapid passivation on the surface of the titanium matrix. However, the corrosion resistance of SLM-produced Ti-2.5TiN composite possesses is better than the SLM-produced Ti-2.5TiB and CP-Ti after immersion for 5 and 10 days. The fine grain size, the δ-TiN phase, and the higher relative density can help the Ti-2.5TiN surface to form a stable passive film. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Corrosion resistance; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Passive film; Selective laser melting; Titanium matrix composites","Corrosion resistance; Corrosive effects; Electrochemical corrosion; Melting; Selective laser melting; Sodium chloride; Titanium; Titanium compounds; Ceramics particles; Commercial pure titanium; Corrosion behaviour; Electrochemical-impedance spectroscopies; Ex situ; In-situ synthesized; Passive films; Selective laser melting; Titania matrix; Titanium matrix composites; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy","","","","","Guangxi Key Laboratory of Information Materials, (211003-K); MOE Key Lab of Disaster Forecast and Control in Engineering in Jinan University, (20200904006); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (92166112); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, WNLO, (2021WNLOKF010); Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, WNLO; State Key Laboratory of Mechanical Transmissions, SKLMT, (SKLMT-MSKFKT-202102); State Key Laboratory of Mechanical Transmissions, SKLMT; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (21622111); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2020B1515420004); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","This work was financially supported by the Major Research Plan of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 92166112 ), the Project of MOE Key Lab of Disaster Forecast and Control in Engineering in Jinan University (Grant No. 20200904006 ), the Guangdong Province Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (Grant No. 2020B1515420004 ), the Guangxi Key Laboratory of Information Materials (Grant No. 211003-K ), and the Open Project Program of Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics (Grant No. 2021WNLOKF010 ), the Open Project Program of the State Key Laboratory of Mechanical Transmissions in Chongqing University (Grant No. SKLMT-MSKFKT-202102 ). and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. 21622111 ).","Zhang L.C., Chen L., A review on biomedical titanium alloys: recent progress and prospect, Adv.

It was hypothesized that the highly strained YBCO columns around the BZO 1D-APCs due to the larger lattice constant of BZO than YBCO's in c-axis by 7.7% provide channels to facilitate Ca diffusion more preferably near the BZO/YBCO interface, leading to an enlarged YBCO's c-axis lattice constant as a consequence of the Ca/Cu substitution on the YBCO's Cu-O planes. Confirmation of this hypothesis is hence important to understand the mechanism of Ca diffusion in BZO/YBCO ML films for further enhancement of pinning efficiency of the BZO 1D-APCs. Motivated by this, this work presents a comparative study of two sets of BZO/YBCO ML films: singly-doped (SD-ML, BZO only) and the doubly-doped (DD-ML, BZO + Y2O3). The modulated strain field in the SD-ML films is in contrast to the non-modulated strain in the DD-ML samples as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Interestingly, improved pinning by >four times of the reference SD single-layer (SD-SL) film’ was observed in the SD-ML samples even when the constituent BZO/YBCO layer thickness was varied between 50-100 nm, indicating that the Ca diffusion along the strained BZO/YBCO interface and the Ca/Cu substitution on YBCO's Cu-O planes indeed correlate with the modulated strain field. In contrast, pinning degrades by >twice in DD-ML samples with respect to their DD-SL counterpart's. This result therefore suggests that strained BZO/YBCO interfaces serve as channels for Ca diffusion in SD-ML, which leads to the coherent BZO/YBCO interfaces and hence improved pinning of BZO 1D-APCs. This effect diminishes when such a modulated strain field is removed in the DD-ML samples. © 2022","1D artificial pinning center; Coherent interface; Dynamic lattice enlargement; Interficial strain; Vortex pinning efficiency; YBCO nanocomposites","Anisotropy; Barium compounds; Copper compounds; Diffusion; Efficiency; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Lattice constants; Lattice mismatch; Multilayer films; Multilayers; Nanocomposite films; Perovskite; Yttrium barium copper oxides; 1d artificial pinning center; Artificial pinning centers; Coherent interface; Dynamic lattice enlargement; Dynamic lattices; Interficial strain; Pinning efficiency; Vortex pinning; Vortex pinning efficiency; YBCO nanocomposite; Nanocomposites","","","","","LRIR, (14RQO8COR, 18RQCOR100); National Science Foundation, NSF; Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR; Purdue University, PU, (DMR-1565822, DMR-2016453); Purdue University, PU; Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL","This research was supported in part by NSF contracts Nos: NSF-DMR-1909292 and NSF-ECCS-1809293 , the AFRL Aerospace Systems Directorate, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) LRIR #14RQO8COR and LRIR #18RQCOR100.

In this study, 316L stainless-steel metal filled filaments were used to print metal parts using the extrusion-based fused filament fabrication (FFF) approach. The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of common FFF printing parameters on the geometric and mechanical performance of FFF manufactured 316L stainless-steel components. Design/methodology/approach: The microstructural characteristics of the metal filled filament, three-dimensional (3D) printed green parts and final sintered parts were analysed. In addition, the dimensional accuracy of the green parts was evaluated, as well as the hardness, tensile properties, relative density, part shrinkage and the porosity of the sintered samples. Moreover, surface quality in terms of surface roughness after sintering was assessed. Predictive models based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used for characterizing dimensional accuracy, shrinkage, surface roughness and density. Additionally, the response surface method based on ANNs was applied to represent the behaviour of these parameters and to identify the optimum 3D printing conditions. Findings: The effects of the FFF process parameters such as build orientation and nozzle diameter were significant. The pore distribution was strongly linked to the build orientation and printing strategy. Furthermore, porosity decreased with increased nozzle diameter, which increased mechanical performance. In contrast, lower nozzle diameters achieved lower roughness values and average deviations. Thus, it should be noted that the modification of process parameters to achieve greater geometrical accuracy weakened mechanical performance. Originality/value: Near-dense 316L austenitic stainless-steel components using FFF technology were successfully manufactured. This study provides print guidelines and further information regarding the impact of FFF process parameters on the mechanical, microstructural and geometric performance of 3D printed 316L components. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","316L austenitic stainless-steel; Additive manufacturing; Dimensional accuracy; Fused filament fabrication; Mechanical characterization; Porosity; Process parameters","3D printers; Additives; Austenitic stainless steel; Extrusion; Geometry; Metals; Neural networks; Nozzles; Porosity; Shrinkage; Sintering; Surface properties; Surface roughness; Tensile strength; 316 L stainless steel; 316L austenitic stainless steel; Dimensional accuracy; Fused filament fabrication; Mechanical characterizations; Mechanical performance; Metal parts; Nozzle diameter; Process parameters; Steel components; Fabrication","","","","","Consejería de Educación, Cultura y Deportes; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF; Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha, JCCM, (SBPLY/19/180501/000170, SBPLY/19/180501/000247); Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha, JCCM; Spanish National Plan for Scientific and Technical Research and Innovation, (MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033, PID2019–104586RB-I00); Spanish National Plan for Scientific and Technical Research and Innovation","This research was supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (Plan Estatal de Investigación Científica Técnica y de Innovación), under research grant PID2019–104586RB-I00 funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and Consejería de Educación, Cultura y Deportes (Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha), under research grants SBPLY/19/180501/000247 and SBPLY/19/180501/000170, co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).

It is complemented with finite element analysis of tibial tray made of the developed alloys. Minimum aspect ratio of 1.11 and continuous deposition was obtained for 264 W μ-plasma power, 2.5 g/min deposition material powder mass flow rate, and 50 mm/min deposition head travel speed. Hence it was used for manufacturing multi-layer multi-track depositions of powder of Co-Cr-Mo-xTi alloys. Co-Cr-Mo-xTi alloys showed high % of Co-rich matrix consisting of α-Co phase formed to minor alloying elements Ni and Fe and ε-Co phase stabilized by molybdenum, ß-Ti phase, inter-metallic phase CoTi2, and lamellar chromium carbides Cr7C3 and Cr23C6 on grain boundaries which will impart more wear and corrosion resistance to Co-Cr-xTi alloys. Their samples fractured within their gauge length with slight localized necking indicating strain localization in a very small region before their ductile fracture during their tensile testing. Optimized deposition of Cr-Co-Mo-4Ti alloy has more uniform distribution of porosity and absence of thermal crack which is desirable for knee implant material as it allows better osseointegration with the human bones and tissues. It has higher tensile and compressive yield strength, ultimate tensile and compressive strength, and ductility indicated by higher % elongation and % increase in cross-section area due to more uniform porous structure, finer grain size, absence of thermal cracks, and presence of chromium carbide phases which obstruct movement of dislocations. It also has minimum value of avg. scratch track width and coefficient of friction, and maximum value of scratch hardness number imparting it better abrasion resistance due to presence of fine lamellar carbide phases. Finite element analysis of tibial tray revealed that equivalent Von-Mises stress and total deformation increase with increase in wt% of Ti in Co-Cr-Mo alloy. This study found Co-Cr-Mo-4Ti alloy as a better knee implant material due to its uniform porosity without thermal cracks, finer grain size, higher yield compressive and tensile strength, higher ductility, and abrasion resistance. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Abrasion resistance;

Five types of pore architecture scaffolds have been made using a computer-aided designed tool and fabricated through fused deposition modeling. Design/methodology/approach: Compressive structural analysis has been performed using the finite element method to forecast the mechanical performance of the scaffolds. Also, the experimental study was done to validate the simulation outcomes. A computational fluid dynamic analysis was performed to ascertain the fluid pressure distribution, velocity profile, wall shear stress, strain rate and permeability of scaffolds. The interconnected pore architecture of the scaffolds plays a crucial role in enhancing the mechanical properties and fluid flow characteristics. Findings: The scaffolds with continuous vertical support columns resulted in better strength because they provide better ways to transfer the load. The pore architecture of the scaffold plays a significant role in the path of fluid flow. Scaffolds with regular interconnected pore architecture showed better accessibility of the fluid. The degradation analysis showed that the degradation rate is dependent on the architecture of the scaffolds because of different surface area to volume ratios. Originality/value: The simulation results provide a straightforward prediction of the scaffold suitability in terms of mechanical strength, perfusion and degradation behavior.

To overcome the room temperature brittleness induced manufacturing difficulty, additive manufacturing (AM) technology of titanium aluminide has been developing rapidly since last decade. Compared to powder-based AM methods such as electron beam melting (EBM), the twin-wire directed energy deposition-arc (TW-DED-arc) method for titanium aluminide fabrication possesses outstanding material deposition efficiency and much lower cost. However, because of the excessive arc deposition energy, the layer-band like microstructure of TW-DED-arc fabricated titanium aluminide is a great concern affecting the mechanical properties. In the present research, microstructure of as-fabricated TiAl alloy is modified by adjusting the deposition current of TW-DED-arc. Experimental results show that along with the increase of deposition current, the layer-band like microstructure consisting of dendritic grain region and fully lamellar colony region can be mostly homogenized. Although microhardness is decreased because of the inevitable lamella growth, tensile strength of TiAl deposit is on the other hand increased by eliminating the interdendritic γ-phase. In general, the present work has proved that deposition current adjustment is an effective method for homogenizing the microstructure of additively manufactured titanium aluminide. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Directed energy deposition-arc; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Titanium aluminide","3D printers; Additives; Aerospace industry; Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Deposition; Fabrication; Fracture mechanics; Tensile strength; Titanium alloys; Deposition current; Directed energy; Directed energy deposition-arc; Energy depositions; Highest temperature; Lower density; Microstructure modifications; Performance; TiAl alloy; Titanium aluminides; Microstructure","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51901136); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM, (19511106400, 19YF1422700); Shanghai Jiao Tong University, SJTU","Funding text 1: The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM, Funding No. 19511106400 , “Sailing Program” No. 19YF1422700 ) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, Funding No. 51901136 ).

The current study aims to use a heat treatment method to increase the properties of the as-built EB-PBF IN738LC and explore the applicability and necessity of standard heat treatment designed for cast IN738 on the EB-PBF counterpart. Different heat treatment (HT) methods, such as standard heat treatment (SHT), hot isostatic pressing (HIP), and HIP+SHT, have been performed. The microstructures before and after HT are scrutinized focusing on the evolution of the precipitates. Tensile tests were carried out to evaluate the effect of the heat treatment. The grain morphology can be altered by a HIP process but not the SHT process. The HIP process induces more carbides to be precipitated; the carbide changes from MC to M23C6 during the SHT process, and the γ’ phase changes from the cuboidal shape in the as-built state to the spherical shape in SHT processes. The refined grain and disappearance of pores are the reasons for the increased elongation ratios of HIP samples. Combining the HIP and SHT processes helps refine the grain and improve the mechanical properties. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Electron beam powder bed fusion; Heat Treatment; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Nonweldable superalloys","Carbides; Electron beams; Heat treatment; Hot isostatic pressing; Microstructure; Morphology; Nickel alloys; Tensile testing; Electron beam powder bed fusion; Electron-beam; Heat-treatment process; Hot-isostatic pressings; Nonweldable; Nonweldable superalloy; Powder bed; Property; Standard heat treatments; Treatment methods; Superalloys","","","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFB1105204); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","Yang Li and Prof. Feng Lin acknowledges the financial support of the National Key R&D Program of China ( 2018YFB1105204 ).","Trosch T., Strossner J., Volkl R., Glatzel U., Microstructure and mechanical properties of selective laser melted Inconel 718 compared to forging and casting, Mater.

Additionally, to verify these estimates, a coupled experimental–computational approach using the crack-compliance method was investigated in this study. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a previously validated thermomechanical process simulation was used to estimate the residual stresses developed in the MF3 printing process. Metal-filled polymer filament with a solids loading of 59 Vol.% Ti-6Al-4V was studied. For experimental validation of simulation predictions, the MF3 printed green parts were slitted incrementally and the corresponding strains were measured locally using strain gauges. The developed strain was modeled in finite-element-based structural simulations to estimate a compliance matrix that was combined with strain gauge measurements to calculate the residual stresses. Finally, the simulation results were compared with the experimental findings. Findings: The simulation predictions were corroborated by the experimental results. Both results showed the same distribution pattern, that is, tensile stresses at the outer zone and compressive stresses in the interior. In the experiments, the residual stresses varied between 1.02 MPa (tension) and −2.28 MPa (compression), whereas the simulations were predicted between 1.37 MPa (tension) and −1.39 MPa (compression). Overall, there was a good quantitative agreement between the process simulation predictions and the experimental measurements, although there were some discrepancies. It was concluded that the thermomechanical process simulation was able to predict the residual stresses developed in MF3 printed parts. This validation enables the printing process simulation to be used for optimizing the part design and printing parameters to minimize the residual stresses. Originality/value: The applicability of thermomechanical process simulation to predict residual stresses in MF3 printing is demonstrated. Additionally, a coupled experimental–computational approach using the crack-compliance method was used to experimentally determine residual stresses in the three-dimensional printed part to validate the simulation predictions. Moreover, this paper presents a methodology that can be used to predict and measure residual stresses in other additive manufacturing processes, in general, though MF3 was used as demonstrator in this work. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Crack compliance method; Metal fused filament fabrication; Residual stress; Simulation; Titanium Ti-6Al-4","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Compliance control; Elasticity; Fabrication; Forecasting; Strain; Strain gages; Ternary alloys; Titanium; Titanium alloys; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Crack compliance method; Metal fused filament fabrication; Process simulations; Simulation; Simulation prediction; Thermomechanical process; Titania; Titania ti-6al-4; Residual stresses","","","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA; Minority Business Development Agency, MBDA","The authors acknowledge the funding from the Minority Business Development Agency, USA (MBDA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

However, commercially available hydrophilic implants, such as SLActive™, have some major limitations due to their time-dependent biological aging and lower cost-effectiveness. The non-thermal atmospheric plasma (NTAP) treatment is a reliable way to gain a hydrophilic surface and enhance osseointegration. However, a few studies have been carried out to compare the osseointegration of NTAP-functionalized titanium implants and commercially available hydrophilic implants. Purpose: In this study, we compare the osseointegration abilities of the NTAP-functionalized titanium implant and Straumann SLActive. Material and methods: The NTAP effectiveness was examined using in vitro cell experiments. Then, six beagle dogs were included in the in vivo experiment. Straumann SLActive implants, SLA implants, and SLA implants treated with NTAP were implanted in the mandibular premolar area of dogs. After 2 w, 4 w, and 8 w, the animals were sacrificed and specimens were collected. Radiographic and histological analyses were used to measure osseointegration. Results: NTAP treatment accelerated the initial attachment and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. In the in vivo experiment, bone parameters (e.g., BIC value and BV/TV) and volume of new bone of NTAP groups were close to those of the SLActive group. Additionally, although there was no statistical difference, the osseointegration of SLActive and NTAP groups was evidently superior to that of the SLA group. Conclusion: NTAP-functionalized implants enhanced cell interaction with material and subsequent bone formation. The osseointegration of the NTAP-functionalized implant was comparable to that of the SLActive implant at the early osseointegration stage.

In this work, succinic acid has been successfully extracted from model fermentation broths through a stripping phase-facilitated transport mechanism with four different green supported liquid membranes: two eutectic solvents (DL-menthol:OctA and N4444Cl:OctA), the bio-based solvent eucalyptol and the ionic liquid [C4pyrr][Tf2N]. A permeability activity-based model that takes into account for the first time solute-phase affinities has been developed using the quantum chemical COSMO-RS method; the model corrects the mass transfer driving force and allows extraction predictions beyond the concentration equilibrium. The best recovery has been achieved experimentally for the eucalyptol-based SLM (concentration factor of 1.4) using an alkaline aqueous solution (0.5 M NaOH) as the stripping phase. A countercurrent cascade extraction process design is proposed, and a graphical method to determine the stage number, interstage concentrations as well as mass transfer area requirements is presented. This new tool, the Permeability Activity-Based Linear Operation (PABLO) method, will substantially enhance the process design of SLMs technology for the biorefinery industry. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Biorefinery; COSMO-RS; Green solvent; Organic acid; Process design; Supported liquid membrane (SLMs)","Alkalinity; Design; Extraction; Ionic liquids; Mass transfer; Process design; Quantum chemistry; Refining; Sodium hydroxide; Solvents; Activity-based; Biorefineries; COSMO-RS; Greener solvents; Linear operations; Operation methods; Separation process; Stripping phasis; Supported liquid membrane; Liquid membranes","","","","","Ramon y Cajal programme, (RYC2019-027060-I/AEI/10.13039/501100011033); Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, CONICYT, (CHILE/2017 – 72180306); Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, CONICYT; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO; Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, UPM; European Social Fund, ESF","This work was funded by the CONICYT PFCHA/DOCTORADO BECAS CHILE/2017 – 72180306.

Due to the material's high laser reflectivity and thermal conductivity, however, employing the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing process on Cu15Ni8Sn alloy has been a challenge. This issue was addressed in the present study by modifying the Cu15Ni8Sn powder by adding 1 wt% submicrometre TiB2 ceramic particles. The results indicate that the LPBF's processability was improved by the increased laser absorption rate caused by the addition of 1 wt% TiB2, which eliminated pores and unmelted area defects. The addition of 1 wt% TiB2 also improved the components' surface quality by reducing the surface roughness value of 39.3% compared to the original Cu15Ni8Sn. The findings also indicate that the added TiB2 particles reduced Sn-segregation behaviour, implying that the content and size of the segregated phase could be tailored by the suitable selection of ceramic materials and LPBF process parameters. Another advantage lies in the enhancement of mechanical performance, where a 11% increase in yield strength and 14% increase in ultimate tensile strength were achieved in the LPBF-fabricated modified Cu15Ni8Sn material. In this study, the primary strengthening mechanisms for LPBF-fabricated original Cu15Ni8Sn were found to include dislocation strengthening and grain boundary strengthening. Orowan precipitation strengthening also played a significant role in the Cu15Ni8Sn-1wt.% TiB2 material, as did dislocation strengthening and grain boundary strengthening. These findings provide a promising strategy to improve the LPBF processability of the advanced copper-based materials used in several key fields. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Cu15Ni8Sn alloy; Laser powder bed fusion; Processability; Strengthening mechanisms","3D printers; Additives; Copper alloys; Grain boundaries; Surface roughness; Tensile strength; Tin alloys; Titanium alloys; Cu15ni8sn alloy; Dislocation strengthening; Grain boundary strengthening; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Mechanical performance; Microstructure performance; Powder bed; Processability; Strengthening mechanisms; Ternary alloys","","","","","Key Laboratory of High-efficiency and Clean Mechanical Manufacture at Shandong University; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52005295); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE; Huazhong University of Science and Technology, HUST, (P2022-013)","The authors appreciate the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52005295 ), the State Key Laboratory of Materials Processing and Die & Mould Technology , Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Grant No. P2022-013 ), and the Key Laboratory of High-efficiency and Clean Mechanical Manufacture at Shandong University , Ministry of Education.","Thijs L., Verhaeghe F., Craeghs T., Van Humbeeck J., Kruth J.P., A study of the microstructural evolution during selective laser melting of Ti–6Al–4V, Acta Mater., 58, pp. 3303-3312, (2010); Han Q., Low K.W.Q., Gu Y., Wang X., Wang L., Song B., Huang C., Setchi R., The dynamics of reinforced particle migration in laser powder bed fusion of Ni-based composite, Powder Technol., 394, pp. 714-723, (2021); Han Q., Mertens R., Montero-Sistiaga M.L., Yang S., Setchi R., Vanmeensel K., Van Hooreweder B., Evans S.L., Fan H., Laser powder bed fusion of Hastelloy X: effects of hot isostatic pressing and the hot cracking mechanism, Mater.

The utilization of LPBF for the fabrication of the part provides great freedom to its structure optimization, further reduces its weight and improves its portability. Design/methodology/approach: The stress distribution of the model was analyzed by finite element analysis. The material distribution path of the model was optimized through topology optimization. The structure and size of the parts were designed by applying honeycomb structures for weight reduction. The lightweight designed control stick part model was printed by LPBF using AlSi10Mg. Findings: The weight of the control stick model was reduced by 32.64% through the optimization method using honeycomb structures with various geometries. The similar stress concentrations of the control stick model indicate that weight reduction has negligible effect on its mechanical strength. The maximum stress of the lightweight designed model under loading is 230.85 MPa, which is 61.81% larger than that of the original model. The lightweight control stick part manufactured by LPBF has good printability and service performance. Originality/value: A structural optimization method integrating topology, shape and size optimization was proposed for a lightweight AlSi10Mg control stick printed by LPBF. The effectiveness of the optimization method, the printability of the lightweight model and the service performance of LPBF-printed AlSi10Mg control stick was verified, which provided practical references for the lightweight design of AM. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing; Laser powder bed fusion; Lightweight design; Structure optimization","Additives; Honeycomb structures; Shape optimization; Stress analysis; Stress concentration; Structural design; Structural optimization; Topology; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Lightweight design; Optimization method; Powder bed; Stick model; Structural optimisations; Structure optimization; Topology optimisation; Weight reduction; 3D printers","","","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFE0203500); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2019B1515120094, 2021A1515110527)","The work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China [grant numbers 2021YFE0203500] and the Guangdong Province Basic and Applied Basic Research Fund Project [grant numbers 2019B1515120094 and 2021A1515110527].

In this study, the novel Ti–6Al–4V-7.5Ni components were fabricated for the first time using Ti–6Al–4V and pure Ni welding wires as feedstock and in-situ alloying by dual-wire arc additive manufacturing (D-WAAM) through controlled wire feeding speed of wire. After fabrication, the effects of designed Ni addition on microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti–6Al–4V were studied. The results show that appropriate Ni promotes the transformation from columnar to equiaxed grains. The prior β grains and α laths were significantly refined. Nano-scale Ti2Ni phases with a scale range of 20–120 nm were formed between α-Ti and β-Ti. The solid solution strengthening caused by the Ni, the precipitation strengthening caused by Ti2Ni and grain refinement jointly promote the improvement of the strength of Ti–6Al–4V-7.5Ni components. The hardness of Ti–6Al–4V-7.5Ni was 457 ± 6 HV0.2, which was 38.9% higher than that of Ti–6Al–4V. Besides, the average ultimate tensile strength of Ti–6Al–4V-7.5Ni was 1012 ± 38 MPa, which was 26.5% higher than that of Ti–6Al–4V. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Directed energy deposition; Mechanical properties; Microstructural evolution; Ni element; Ti alloys","3D printers; Additives; Deposition; Fabrication; Grain refinement; Microstructural evolution; Nanotechnology; Nickel alloys; Tensile strength; Textures; Titanium alloys; Wire; Columnar grain; Directed energy; Directed energy deposition; Energy depositions; ITS applications; Ni element; Ti alloys; Welding wires; Wire arc; Wire feeding; Binary alloys","","","","","","","Airao J., Nirala C.K., Bertolini R., Krolczyk G.M., Khanna N., Sustainable cooling strategies to reduce tool wear, power consumption and surface roughness during ultrasonic assisted turning of Ti-6Al-4V, Tribol.

This allows for manufacturing smart parts that can be integrated into complex structures for monitoring applications, as they can perform in situ measurements. Especially, monitoring of force and torque is gaining increasing interest. However, a proper strain transmission from the mechanically loaded part to the embedded strain sensing element must be ensured, as the performance of such sensors is strongly dependent on it. In this work, we present an approach for additively manufactured deformation elements in a disruptive manner with integrated strain gauges using a steel plate as a measuring element carrier. To evaluate the strain transmission, and, thus, the performance of the additively manufactured deformation elements, we compare them to a conventionally manufactured deformation element with identical geometry. The strain gauges are applied after manufacturing at locations with a proper strain, which are determined by finite-element analysis (FEA). Loading these additively and conventionally manufactured prototypes with 15N results in only 0.1% linearity and 0.2% hysteresis error. Furthermore, a nearly linear temperature behavior of manufactured prototypes with a TK 0 of up to 0.3%/10K and a TK C of up to 0.6%/10K is achieved. These results confirm that a proper strain transmission is ensured within the additively manufactured deformation elements, making them competitive with conventionally manufactured deformation elements. Thus, the disruptive manufacturing process introduced is suitable for fabricating structurally integrated force sensors based on strain gauges.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Additive manufacturing (AM); disruptive sensors; force sensors; laser-based powder bed fusion (LPBF); smart parts; structural integration","Additives; Deformation; Finite element method; Strain gages; Strain measurement; Disruptive sensor; Finite element analyse; Force sensor; Laser-based; Laser-based powder bed fusion; Manufacturing; Powder bed; Smart parts; Strains measurements; Structural integration; 3D printers","","","","","","","Chadda R., Et al., Disruptive force sensor based on laser-based powder-bed-fusion, Proc.

In this paper, Ni-rich NiTi-based samples were fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) and then were directly aged for different aging times that spanning three time-scales (10 min-100 h). The results showed that through the aging treatment, a heterogeneous microstructure consisting of Ti4Ni2Ox nanoparticles, nanoscale Ni-rich precipitates, dislocation structures, and martensitic twin variants formed in the matrix. Due to the change in the elastic strain field, the short time aging treatment tended to induce (001) compound twins, while the long time aging assisted in the formation of< 011 > type II twins. The temperature-induced and deformation-induced phase transformation behavior were further studied. With the progress of precipitates, it was found that a rapid evolution from a single-stage phase transformation to a multi-stage one occurred. During the cyclic compression, the sample aged for 1 h showed the most excellent superelasticity with initial recoverable strain of 0.089 and steady recoverable strain of 0.087, as well as good cyclic stability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Aging treatment; Laser powder bed fusion; Microstructure; NiTi SMAs; Phase transformation behavior; Superelasticity","Binary alloys; Elasticity; Martensitic transformations; Shape-memory alloy; Titanium alloys; Ageing treatments; Heterogeneous microstructure; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; NiTi SMA; Phase transformation behavior; Powder bed; Recoverable strain; Strain induced; Superelasticity; Microstructure","","","","","Cardiff University; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52105345, U1930207); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (JUSRP122028)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52105345 , U1930207 ), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. JUSRP122028 ).

Nevertheless, gas lubrication is low viscosity and compressible. It causes the gas bearing-rotor system easy to produce self-excited vibration, which leads to instability of the rotor system and hinders the increase of rotor system speed. It is necessary to study the nonlinear behaviors of the aerostatic bearing-rotor system and the nonlinear vibration of the gas bearing-rotor system, especially considering the distribution mass and flexible and gyroscopic effects of the real rotor. In this paper, the nonlinear behavior of the gas bearing-rotor system is investigated from the viewpoint of nonlinear dynamics. Firstly, the dynamics model of a gas bearing rotor is established by combining the transient Reynolds equation and rotor dynamic equation obtained by finite element method (FEM). The transient Reynolds equation is solved using a hybrid method combining the differential transform method (DTM) and finite difference method (FDM). Then the transient gas force is substituted into the FEM rotor dynamic equation. In the end, based on the bifurcation diagram, the orbit of the rotor center, the frequency spectrum diagram and Poincaré map, the rotor system’s nonlinear behaviors are studied using a solution for the rotor dynamic equation with the Newmark method. Results show that there exists a limited cycle motion in the autonomous rotor system and half-speed whirl in the nonautonomous rotor system. © 2022 by the authors.","DTM; gas bearing-rotor system; nonlinear vibration; transient Reynolds equation","","","","","","National Major Science and Technology Projects of China, (2017-I-0008-0009, J2019-IV-0005-0072)","The present research has been funded by National Science and Technology Major Project of China (J2019-IV-0005-0072 and 2017-I-0008-0009); the authors would like to sincerely express their appreciation.","Zhang J., Zou D., Ta N., Rao Z., Numerical research of pressure depression in aerostatic thrust bearing with inherent orifice, Tribol.

The proposed technique mimics the process of metal injection moulding but with the tools meant for fused freeform fabrication machines. Design/methodology/approach: The work focusses on the preparation of novel feedstock by mixing the aluminium powder with binders made from different compositions of high-density polyethylene, paraffin wax, petroleum jelly and stearic acid. Further, a novel experimental setup with a paste extruder was designed to print the test samples. A sintering cycle was developed in-house along with a thermal debinding procedure. An experimental campaign was also carried with the proposed technique to establish a proof-of-concept. Produced samples were tested for part density, hardness, compressive strength and tensile strength. Findings: The results indicate geometrical accuracy was an issue owing to the presence of petroleum jelly in the binder-powder mixture. Therefore, machining as a post-processing operation seems to be unavoidable. The study also elucidates that the printed specimen may require further heat treatment to replace wrought alloys. However, the sintered parts show hardness and compressive strength similar to that of wrought aluminium alloy. Originality/value: The novelty of the work is to develop the cost effective and scalable powder extrusion-based MAM process for printing the aluminium parts. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Aluminium;

In this work, we present a strategy for inhibiting the formation of columnar grains in which 0.3 wt% scandium (Sc) was introduced as an oxide dispersion strengthener (ODS) into the Inconel 718 (IN718) alloy fabricated via laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). The effects of Sc on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the IN718 were investigated, revealing the in-situ formation of Sc2O3 nanoparticles as well as the cellular sub-grains microstructure with high-density of dislocations into the as-prepared IN718-Sc alloy. The addition of Sc disrupted the typical columnar grains generated by the LPBF process, resulting in, the strong (100) texture in pure IN718 alloy changing to the irregular orientation in IN718-Sc alloy. In addition, the average grain size and the aspect ratio also show decreases when Sc introduction. As a result, the as-designed IN718-Sc alloy achieved a higher yield strength of 1030 MPa at room temperature and 837 MPa at 650 ºC, respectively, which can be attributed to Zener pinning of grain boundaries by dispersed Sc2O3 nanoparticles. Importantly, the insight into dispersing oxide particles to regulate microstructure and improve properties in this study could provide guidance for other alloy fabrication through powder additive manufacturing. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additively manufacturing; Columnar grain; Inconel 718; Rare earth element; Sc<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>; Yield strength","3D printers; Additives; Aspect ratio; Density (specific gravity); Dispersions; Grain boundaries; Grain size and shape; Nanoparticles; Rare earths; Textures; Additively manufacturing; Columnar grain; Inconel 718 alloy; Inconel-718; Laser powders; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Oxide dispersions; Powder bed; Scandium addition; Scandium2O3; Yield stress","","","","","High-Tech Industrial Science and Technology Innovation Leading Plan of Hunan Province , China, (2020GK4018); High-Tech Industrial Science and Technology Innovation Leading Plan of Hunan Province, China; Transformation and Industrialization Plan of Scientific and Technological Achievements of Hunan Province, (2020GK2031); Central South University, CSU; State Key Laboratory of Powder Metallurgy, SKLPM; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFB0704101); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2019B010943001)","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge ﬁnancial supports from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2018YFB0704101 ), the Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province , China (No. 2019B010943001 ), High-Tech Industrial Science and Technology Innovation Leading Plan of Hunan Province , China ( 2020GK4018 ), Transformation and Industrialization Plan of Scientific and Technological Achievements of Hunan Province , China ( 2020GK2031 ) and the fund of State Key Laboratory of Powder Metallurgy, Central South University.; Funding text 2: The authors would like to acknowledge ﬁnancial supports from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2018YFB0704101), the Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province, China (No. 2019B010943001), High-Tech Industrial Science and Technology Innovation Leading Plan of Hunan Province, China (2020GK4018), Transformation and Industrialization Plan of Scientific and Technological Achievements of Hunan Province, China (2020GK2031) and the fund of State Key Laboratory of Powder Metallurgy, Central South University.","Choudhury B., Chandrasekaran M., Investigation on welding characteristics of aerospace materials – a review, Mater.

However, most AM studies have focused on a build process performed by an AM machine (also known as a 3D printer). Compared to the build process, AM studies for post-processing have lagged behind in production planning at the macro level. Post-processing needs highly sophisticated and complicated tasks requiring a lot of process time and cost. Therefore, some AM systems need to primarily cover post-processing as well as the build process, which leads to a more comprehensive approach to production planning. This paper addresses the AM systems based on flow-shop, comprehensively including the build and post processes. For post-processing, we consider trimming, coloring, and assembly processes. This paper introduces three scheduling policies: (1) all-for-one-job; (2) one-for-one-job; and (3) hybrid. The first policy is packing every part into the same job, which means that all parts are simultaneously fabricated during the same build process. The second policy is assigning each part to a particular job, which results in parts being fabricated one by one during the build process. The last policy is a compromise between the former two policies. We propose a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model to minimize the makespan for each policy. In computational experiments with test models, the scheduling optimization for AM is applied to various cases: multiple parts, scheduling policies, and multiple AM machines. One of the main comparisons provides that the MIP model of the hybrid policy is more preferred than the all-for-one-job policy, reducing the makespan by 27.68%. In conclusion, our paper quantitatively shows that packing is not a significant factor in minimizing the makespan when comprehensively considering build and post processes. It is a different perspective from that the traditional scheduling for AM has focused on a packing issue to improve the productivity in the build process. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Post-processing; Process planning; Scheduling","Additives; Integer programming; Planning; Process planning; Production control; Scheduling; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Makespan; Manufacturing machine; Mixed integer programming model; Post process; Post-processing; Production Planning; Scheduling; Scheduling policies; 3D printers","","","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (2021R1G1A1093958, 2021R1G1A1094924)","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grants (No. 2021R1G1A1093958 and No. 2021R1G1A1094924 ) funded by the Korea government (Ministry of Science and ICT: MSIT).","ISO/ASTM52900-15, Standard terminology for additive manufacturing — general principles — terminology, (2015); Chinthavali M., 3D printing technology for automotive applications, 2016 International Symposium on 3D Power Electronics Integration and Manufacturing, 3D-PEIM, pp. 1-13, (2016); Joshi S.C., Sheikh A.A., 3D printing in aerospace and its long-term sustainability, Virtual Phys.

The densification feature, microstructure and mechanical properties of the as-fabricated specimens were studied, as well as the influence of solution-aging heat treatment on the microstructure and mechanical properties. The results show that dense samples (relative density >99.5%) can be obtained when the laser energy density (Ev) is higher than 80 J/mm3. A large quantity of columnar prior-austenite grains (PAGs) are observed within the as-fabricated samples, and a typical dendritic microstructure is shown inside the PAGs. Some ordered Ni(Al, Fe) intermetallics precipitates with diameters of 3–5 nm have formed as the result of the intrinsic heat treatment effect. With the increase of Ev, the average width of the PAGs and the average dendrite arm spacing are increased. The sample fabricated with the Ev of 111 J/mm3 (short for HP-AF) has the best trade-off between build rate and mechanical properties among the as-fabricated samples. The build rate of the HP-AF sample is up to 18 mm3/s, which is about 3 times higher than that of the previous studies based on low power laser powder bed fusion. The yield strength (YS) (983 ± 10 MPa), ultimate tensile strength (UTS) (1100 ± 11 MPa) and elongation (El) (9.8 ± 0.7%) of the HP-AF sample are comparable to those of the wrought 18Ni300. After solution-aging treatment, the austenite fraction increases from 4.4% (HP-AF) to 5.3%, whilst the Ti/Al rich nano precipitates with size 30–45 nm can be observed in the matrix. After solution-aging treatment, the YS and UTS of the sample (short for HP-ST + AT) are dramatically increased to 1945 ± 12 MPa and 1865 ± 8 MPa, though the elongation is decreased to 5.4 ± 0.5%. The mechanical property of the HP-ST + AT samples is comparable to that of the wrought-aged 18Ni300. The high strength of the HP-ST + AT 18Ni300 sample is mainly attributed to precipitation strengthening as well as dislocation strengthening, followed by grain boundary strengthening. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","18Ni300 maraging steel; Build rate; High power laser powder bed fusion (HP-LPBF); Microstructure and mechanical property; Solution-aging heat treatment","Austenite; Carbon dioxide lasers; Economic and social effects; Elongation; Fabrication; Heat treatment; High power lasers; Maraging steel; Tensile strength; 18ni300 maraging steel; Aging heat treatment; Build rate; High power laser powder bed fusion; High-power lasers; Laser powders; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Powder bed; Solution-aging; Solution-aging heat treatment; Microstructure","","","","","Huazhong University of Science and Technology, HUST, (2021XXJS029); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFB1103800); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Major Science and Technology Projects of China, (Y2019-VII-0011-0151)","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China, China (Grant No. 2017YFB1103800 ), the National Science and Technology Major Project, China (Grant No. Y2019-VII-0011-0151 ) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China, HUST (Grant No. 2021XXJS029 ).

To date, the mechanism of grain refinement near the fusion line, which contradicts conventional Hunt's columnar–equiaxed transition criteria, remains to be elucidated. Here we present the first report on the mechanism of grain refinement. When a laser was irradiated on cast Al-Si alloy consisting of coarse α-Al grain and α-Al/Si eutectic regions, grain refinement occurred only near the eutectic regions. This strongly suggests that the Si phase is crucial for grain refinement. Multi-phase-field simulation revealed that rapid heating due to the laser irradiation results in unmelted Si particles even above the liquidus temperature and that the particles act as heterogeneous nucleation sites during the subsequent re-solidification. These results suggest the feasibility of a novel inoculant-free grain refinement that is applicable to eutectic alloys comprising phases with a significant melting point difference. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Al-Si hypoeutectic alloy; Grain refinement; Multiphase field simulation; Selective laser-melting","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Eutectics; Grain size and shape; High strength alloys; Nucleation; Selective laser melting; Silicon alloys; Solidification; Textures; Al-si hypoeutectic alloy; Equi-axed grains; Grain formation; Grains refinement; Heterogeneous nucleation; Hypoeutectic alloys; Multi-phase field simulations; Rapid cooling; Rapid-heating; Selective laser melting; Grain refinement","","","","","Japan Aluminium Association; Swine Innovation Porc, SIP; Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST; Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (JP17J06339, JP21H05018, JP21H05193, 18H05254)","Funding text 1: The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Masayuki Okugawa reports financial support was provided by the Japan Aluminium Association.

In this study, two commercial FDM printers (Prusa i3 MK3 and WN400 3D Platform) were used for layer-by-layer manufacturing of polylactic acid (PLA) Dog Bone (DB) and Single Edge Notched Bend (SENB) specimens, aimed at investigating the influence of the manufacturing parameters on the tensile and fracture properties of PLA elements obtained by FDM technology. The effects of growing direction (horizontal and vertical), building orientation (0°, 45° and 90°), printer type, layer thickness (0.15 and 0.40 mm), specimen thickness (4 and 10 mm) and filament color (purple, white, black, gray, red, orange) are discussed in detail. Tensile tests were performed on DB specimens, while fracture mechanics tests on SENB specimens. Both the tensile and fracture properties of FDM 3D-printed PLA specimens have been found to be dependent on the investigated manufacturing parameters. From the microstructural analyses of the SENB fracture surfaces, it has been observed that the fracture mechanisms and crack propagation is a step-wise process. Finally, the material properties charts (Young's modulus and mode I fracture toughness versus tensile strength) are plotted. © 2022 The Author(s)","Crack paths; FDM technique, process parameters; mode I and II fracture toughness; Tensile properties","Cracks; Elastic moduli; Fracture mechanics; Fused Deposition Modeling; Printing presses; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Additive manufacturing technology; Bend specimens; Crack paths; Fracture property; Fused deposition modeling technique, process parameter; Manufacturing parameters; Mode I and II fracture toughness; Modelling techniques; Process parameters; Single-edge notched bends; Fracture toughness","","","","","Corporation for National and Community Service, CNCS; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii, UEFISCDI, (PN-III-P3-3.6-H2020-2020-0079); Ministry of Education and Research, Romania; Horizon 2020, (857124, H2020-WIDESPREAD-2018); Colegiul Consultativ pentru Cercetare-Dezvoltare şi Inovare, CCCDI","Funding text 1: The project leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (H2020-WIDESPREAD-2018, SIRAMM) under grant agreement No. 857124 and was supported by a grant of the Ministry of Education and Research, CNCS/CCCDI - UEFISCDI, project number PN-III-P3-3.6-H2020-2020-0079.

Chemical composition, content of gas impurities, powder grading, pore volume fraction and surface morphology of powder particles, structure and properties of SLM material, surface roughness and deviations from specified geometry of the test samples were investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The experiment’s method procedure presumes the use of only recycled powder without adding any virgin powder at each build cycle. To avoid powder sloughing because of incomplete filling of the build space, a print area delimiter was used. For all manufactured samples, hot isostatic pressing was carried out in an ASEA Quintus-16 facility. Heat treatment was carried out in air furnaces. Structure investigations were carried out on a Leica DMIRM metallographic complex. Microstructure studies were carried out on a Verios 460 scanning electron microscope with X-ray microanalysis. Findings: With the number of recycling stages, an increase in oxygen content is observed in the powder, which leads to an increment for oxides in the printed material. The 16-fold recycling does not have a significant effect on the features of the powder itself and the printed material if the build space is filled with manufacturing parts by no more than 20%. Originality/value: The creep rupture strength of the SLM material, which appears to be a sensitive characteristic to the quality of the applied powder, does not change in the printed material after all stages of powder recycling as well. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing; High-temperature nickel alloy; Powder recycling; Selective laser melting","Grading; Melting; Morphology; Nickel alloys; Scanning electron microscopy; Selective laser melting; Surface morphology; Surface roughness; Alloy powder; Built spaces; High-temperature nickel alloys; Laser melting process; Melting materials; Powder material; Powder recycling; Printed materials; Properties of the powders; Selective laser melting; Recycling","","","","","","","Ardila L.C., Garciandia F., Gonzalez-Diaz J.B., Alvarez P., Echeverria A., Petite M.M., Deffley R., Ochoa J., Effect of IN718 recycled powder reuse on properties of parts manufactured by means of selective laser melting, Physics Procedia, 56, pp. 99-107, (2014); Averyanova M., Bertrand P., Verquin B., Studying the influence of initial powder characteristics on the properties of final parts manufacturing by selective laser melting technology, Virtual and Physical Prototyping, 6, 4, pp. 215-223, (2011); Carrol P.A., Pinkerton A.J., Allen J., Syed W., Sezer H.K., Brown P., Ng G., Scudamore R., Li L., The effect of powder recycling in direct metal laser deposition on powder and manufactured part characteristics, Cost Effective Manufacture via Net-Shape Processing.

Selective laser melting (SLM) experiments were carried out to explore the effect of laser power and scanning speed on the microstructure, melting behaviour and surface roughness of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) ceramic. Design/methodology/approach: The experiments were designed based on varying laser power and scanning speed. The laser power was changed between 50 W and 140 W, and the scanning speed was changed between 170 mm/s and 210 mm/s. Other parameters, such as scanning strategy, layer thickness and hatch spacing, remain constant. Findings: Laser power and scan speed are the two important laser parameters of great significance in the SLM technique that directly affect the molten state of ceramic powders. The findings reveal that Cu2O part defects are widely controlled by gradually increasing the laser power to 110 W and reducing the scanning speed to 170 mm/s. Furthermore, excessive laser power (>120 W) caused surface roughness, cavities and porous microstructure due to the extremely high energy input of the laser beam. Originality/value: The SLM technique was used to produce Cu2O ceramic specimens. SLM of oxide ceramic became feasible using a slurry-based approach. The causes of several part defects such as spattering effect, crack initiation and propagation, the formation of porous microstructure, surface roughness and asymmetrical grain growth during the SLM of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) are thoroughly investigated. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive Manufacturing; Ceramics; Cu<sub>2</sub>O; Cuprous Oxide; Defects; Selective Laser Melting; SLM; Surface Morphology","Additives; Grain growth; Melting; Microstructure; Morphology; Powders; Scanning; Selective laser melting; Speed; Surface morphology; Surface roughness; Ceramic; Ceramic additives; Laser power; Laser scanning; Melting behavior; Melting techniques; Porous microstructure; Scanning speed; Selective laser melting; Copper oxides","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (764935); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51375242); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFB1100504, 2017YFB1103000)","This work was supported by National Key R&D Program of China (Nos. 2017YFB1103000, 2016YFB1100504) and The National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51375242).

Such methods ensure improved process quality and increase the understanding of the manufacturing process, which in turn is the basis for stable component quality, e.g., required in the aerospace industry or in the medical sector. For laser powder bed fusion, a handful of process monitoring tools already exist, such as optical tomography, thermography, pyrometry, imaging, or laser power monitoring. Although these tools provide helpful information about the process, more information is required for an accurate in-depth understanding. In this article, advanced approaches in eddy current testing (ET) are combined, such as single wire excitation, magnetoresistive (MR) sensor arrays, and heterodyning to build up a system that can be used for online process monitoring of laser powder bed fusion. In addition to detailed information about the developed ET system and underlying signal processing, the first results of magnetoresistance-based online ET during the laser powder fusion process are presented. While producing a step-shaped cuboid, each layer is tested during recoating. Test results show that not only the contours of the topmost layer are detected but also the contours of previous layers covered by powder. At an excitation frequency of 1 MHz, a penetration depth of approx. 400∼\μ m is obtained. To highlight the possibilities of ET for online process monitoring of laser powder bed fusion, results are compared with postexposure images of the integrated layer control system (LCS).  © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Additive manufacturing; eddy current testing (ET); giant magnetoresistance (GMR); Haynes282; heterodyning; laser powder bed fusion (LPBF); nondestructive testing; process monitoring","3D printers; Aerospace industry; Data acquisition; Eddy current testing; Optical data processing; Optical tomography; Process control; Eddy-current testing; Haynes282; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Magneto resistive sensors; Magnetoresistive sensors; Non destructive testing; On-line process monitoring; Powder bed; Sensors array; Process monitoring","","","","","European Commission, EC; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (288381); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7","","Khorasani A., Gibson I., Veetil J.K., Ghasemi A.H., A review of technological improvements in laser-based powder bed fusion of metal printers, Int.

Design/methodology/approach: In this research, the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II is used to achieve situations that correspond to the highest RD and the lowest Ra together. Findings: The results show that several situations cause achieving the best RD and optimum Ra. According to the Pareto frontal diagram, there are several choices in a close neighborhood, so that the best setup conditions found to be 102–105 watt for laser power followed by scanning speed of 623–630 mm/s, hatch space of 76–73 µm, scanning patter angle of 35°–45° and heat treatment temperature of 638–640°C. Originality/value: Suitable selection of process parameters and postprocessing treatments lead to a significant reduction in time and cost. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing;

However, the main challenges in industrial applications remain with the quality assurance of mass produced parts. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of compression moulding as a rapid consolidation method for 3D printed composites, with an aim to reduce voids and defects and thus improving quality assurance of printed parts. Design/methodology/approach: To develop an understanding of the inherent voids in 3D parts and the influence on mechanical properties, material extrusion additively manufactured (MEX) parts were post consolidated by using compression moulding at elevated temperature. Findings: This study comparatively investigates the influence of carbon fibre length, undergoing process induced scission during filament extrusion and IM and its impact on void content and mechanical properties. It was found that the post consolidation significantly reduced the voids and the mechanical properties were significantly improved compared to the nonconsolidated material extrusion additively manufactured parts, reaching values similar to those of the IM parts. Practical implications: Adaptation of extrusion-based additive manufacturing with hybridisation of reliable compression moulding technology transcends into series production of highly adaptive end user applications, such as drones, advanced sports prosthetics, competitive cycling and more.

However, recrystallization and grain growth processes upon the stress-relieving heat treatment in SLM-fabricated Co–Cr–Mo alloys are not well understood. In this study, Co–Cr–Mo alloy specimens were fabricated by SLM and then heat treated at 1150 °C for various time periods (10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min) to evaluate the influence of heat treatment time on the recrystallization process. The alloy microstructure was analyzed via confocal laser scanning microscopy, scanning electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and X-ray diffraction analyses. The mechanical properties of the produced specimens were evaluated by tensile tests. When the heat treatment was conducted for up to 45 min, the 0.2% yield strength (YS) decreased, whereas elongation increased. In contrast, when heated for 60 min, both the 0.2% YS and elongation decreased. The EBSD images demonstrated that both columnar and equiaxed grains existed, and recrystallization partially initiated after heating for 10 min. When heated for 45 min or more, the samples consisted entirely of equiaxed grains; however, TEM images showed regions with remaining subgrain boundaries and dislocations. Fully recrystallized microstructures were not obtained even after heating for 60 min. In addition, heat treatments longer than 60 min induced coarse grains and precipitates along the grain boundaries, which decreased the strength and ductility of the alloys. Retaining the subgrains within the grains to some extent enables producing alloys with excellent strength and ductility. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Co–Cr alloy; Grain growth; Heat treatment; Recrystallization; Selective laser melting","Chromium alloys; Ductility; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Grain boundaries; Grain growth; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Melting; Molybdenum alloys; Residual stresses; Scanning electron microscopy; Selective laser melting; Tensile testing; Textures; X ray diffraction analysis; Co-Cr alloys; CoCrMo alloy; Electron back scatter diffraction; Electron backscatter diffraction; Equi-axed grains; Heat treatment time; Post heat-treatment; Recrystallisation; Selective laser melting; Strength and ductilities; Recrystallization (metallurgy)","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (20K10068, 21J40155, 21K17058); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN","This work was partially supported by the JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 20K10068 , 21K17058 , and JSPS Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows Grant Number 21J40155 .","Yamanaka K., Mori M., Yoshida K., Balvay S., Hartmann D., Fabregue D., Chiba A., Preparation of high-strength Co−Cr−Mo alloy rods via hot-caliber rolling, Materialia, 12, (2020); Song C., Zhang M., Yang Y., Wang D., Jia-kuo Y., Morphology and properties of CoCrMo parts fabricated by selective laser melting, Mater.

Herein, the LPBF-printability of AA2024-based nanocomposites is improved by TiC-induced in-situ reinforcement and nanoparticle-enabled grain refinement during laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). The TiC-triggered in-situ reaction during LPBF overcomes the poisoning of the TiC grain refiner that occurs during conventional solidification. It not only results in fine equiaxed grains with a minimum average size of ∼1.6 μm but also suppresses hot crack formation. Powerful L12-Al3Ti nucleants are incorporated in-situ into AA2024 through TiC nanoparticle addition during LPBF, promoting the heterogeneous nucleation of α-Al. Moreover, the growth restriction effect induced by residual TiC nanoparticles and lamellar Al4C3 nanoparticles through pinning behavior along grain boundaries also contributes to grain refinement. Furthermore, these particles serve as effective reinforcement particles as well as grain refiners. The as-built AA2024-based nanocomposites tailored by nano-TiC show a maximum ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of ∼388 MPa, a yield strength (YS) of ∼332 MPa and an elongation (El) of ∼10.2%. After T6 heat treatment, the nanocomposites exhibit an outstanding UTS of ∼507 MPa, a YS of ∼456 MPa and an El of ∼6.6%. This nano-TiC-induced microstructural control method provides new insights into successful AM of hot-crack-sensitive high-strength aluminum alloys and their composites. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","AA2024 nanocomposites; Additive manufacturing; Grain refinement; Hot crack; Laser powder bed fusion","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Aluminum compounds; Grain boundaries; Grain size and shape; High strength alloys; Nanocomposites; Nanoparticles; Nucleation; Refining; Tensile strength; Textures; Titanium carbide; Aa2024 nanocomposite; Grain refiner; Grains refinement; High strength aluminium alloys; Hot cracks; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; TiC nanoparticles; Ultimate tensile strength; Grain refinement","","","","","Major Special Project for Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province, (2014B010129002); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2019B090907001); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province","This work was supported by the Research and Development Program Project in Key Areas of Guangdong Province, China ( 2019B090907001 ) and the Major Special Project for Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province, China ( 2014B010129002 ).

In the present work, WAAM was used to fabricate bimetallic laminated steel structure (BLSS) with enhanced strength-ductility synergy by alternately depositing 304 stainless steel (304 SS) and low carbon steel (LCS) on Q345 substrate. The microstructure and mechanical properties of additive manufactured BLSS were investigated in detail. The 304 SS layer is composed of martensite, different from the vermicular ferrite distributed in the austenite matrix of the single-304 SS structure. While the LCS layer has no obvious change compared to the single-LCS structure, except for the refinement of the blocky ferrite. Meanwhile, fine grains formed at the interface between the LCS and 304 SS layers. The differences in element content, phase constituent and grain size between different layers lead to changes in the mechanical properties of this BLSS along different loading directions. The tensile strength and elongation in the longitudinal (Y) direction reached 999.8 MPa and 28.2%, respectively, where the strength was almost twice that of single-material 304 SS and LCS structure with the elongation between them. Digital image correlation (DIC) was used to observe the strain distribution of the BLSS during tensile process, and a significant stress concentration was observed in the transversal (Z) direction, resulting in a decrease in its tensile properties compared to the Y direction. Fracture topography analysis of specimens with different loading directions revealed a brittle-ductile mixed fracture mode. Our work provides a feasible and flexible method for the fabrication of BLSS with superior mechanical properties, which have potential applications in fields such as architectural and civil engineering structures. © 2022 The Authors","Anisotropy; Bimetallic laminated steel structure; Local strain distribution; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Wire and arc additive manufacturing","Additives; Ductility; Fabrication; Ferrite; High strength steel; Image correlation; Low carbon steel; Microstructure; Strain; Structural properties; Tensile strength; Topography; Wire; 304 stainless steel; Bimetallic laminated steel structure; Bimetallics; Laminated steels; Local strain distribution; Local strains; Low-carbon steels; Steels carbons; Strain distributions; Wire and arc additive manufacturing; 3D printers","","","","","Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of High Performance Complex Manufacturing; Central South University, CSU, (Kfkt2021-13); Central South University, CSU; Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City, (19JCZDJC39000); Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City; Civil Aviation Administration of China, CAAC, (U1933129); Civil Aviation Administration of China, CAAC","Supporting for the Chinese Civil Aviation Administration, China (No. U1933129 ), Key Program of the Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin, China (No. 19JCZDJC39000 ), and the Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of High Performance Complex Manufacturing , Central South University, China ( Kfkt2021-13) .","Kumar A., Maji K., Microstructure and chemical composition analysis of double wire arc additive manufactured bimetallic structure, J.

In the present work, the reversible γ − ε martensitic transformation (MT), responsible for the shape memory effect, is studied in two Fe-Mn-Si-Cr-Ni alloys with high (20.2 wt%) and low (15.8 wt%) Mn content, produced by the conventional route of casting and rolling, in comparison with the MT in another similar alloy, with intermediate Mn content (19.4 wt%), which was produced by gas atomization and additive manufacturing through laser metal deposition. The forward and reverse γ − ε MT is studied by mechanical spectroscopy through the internal friction spectra and the dynamic modulus variation, together with a parallel microstructural characterization including in-situ observation of the γ − ε MT during cooling and heating at the scanning electron microscope. The evolution of the transformed fraction of ε martensite, evaluated through the integral area of the internal friction peak, was followed along thermal cycling in all three alloys. Both, the internal friction and the electron microscopy studies show that the ε martensite amount increases very fast during the first few cycles, and then decreases with a tendency towards its stabilization for many tens of cycles. The results show that the γ − ε MT is more stable on cycling in the additive manufactured sample than in the conventionally processed samples, opening new avenues for designing shape memory steels to be specifically processed through additive manufacturing. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; Fe-Mn-Si-Cr-Ni; Internal friction; Martensitic transformation; Shape memory alloys","3D printers; Additives; Chromium alloys; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant alloys; Martensite; Nickel alloys; Scanning electron microscopy; Shape-memory alloy; Silicon alloys; Thermal cycling; Casting and rolling; Fe-Mn-Si; Fe-mn-si-cr-ni; Gas atomization; Laser metal deposition; Low-costs; Mn content; Shape-memory; Shape-memory effect; Thermal-cycling; Martensitic transformations","","","","","Eusko Jaurlaritza, (GIU-17/071); Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea, EHU","This work was supported by the ELKARTEK-CEMAP ( KK-2020/00047 ) project from the Industry Department of the Basque Government, and the GIU-17/071 from the University of the Basque Country, UPV/EHU.

In this article, BaZrO3 doped YBa2Cu3O7 (BZO/YBCO) nanocomposite films with BZO doping up to 8 vol.% were fabricated in a multilayer (ML) format by inserting two 10 nm thick Ca0.3Y0.7Ba2Cu3O7-x spacer layers in the BZO/YBCO nanocomposite films for improved pinning and enhanced critical current density Jc at high fields. Significant Jc enhancement was observed in all the BZO/YBCO ML films of BZO doping in the entire range of 2-8 vol.% as compared to their SL counterpart's. At 65 K, the enhancement of peak pinning force density (Fp,max) is 71, 67, 296, and 47% for 2, 4, 6, and 8 vol.% BZO/YBCO ML films, respectively. In addition, the Bmax (the location of the Fp,max) is shifted towards higher values for BZO/YBCO ML films by up to 33%. Interestingly, at high BZO doping of 8 vol.%, the enhanced modulated strain field was found to reduce the detrimental effect of Ca ion diffusion on Tc, leading to Jc enhancement at a strong field up to 9 T at all orientations of the magnetic field.  © 2002-2011 IEEE.","BZO/YBCO interface; lattice mismatch; pinning efficiency; strain field; vortex pinning","Binary alloys; Calcium; Copper oxides; Electronic structure; Interfaces (materials); Ions; Lattice mismatch; Multilayers; Nanocomposite films; Nanocomposites; Semiconductor doping; Superconducting films; Temperature measurement; BZO doping; BZO/YBCO interface; High-field applications; Lattice; Multilayers films; Pinning centres; Pinning efficiency; Spacer layer; Strain fields; Vortex pinning; Yttrium barium copper oxides","","","","","","","Alecu G., Crystal structures of some high-temperature superconductors, Romanian Rep.

The described methodology approaches the design through CAD modeling, Design of Experiments (DoE) and statistical methods along with numerical results from CFD for geometry optimization and scale-up and additive manufacturing of the device. The effects of channel width and characteristic length scales of the static elements on the fluid mixing performance was evaluated by a (DoE). The DoE was performed by numerical runs and evaluated the oil-ethanol mixing at Re = 0.1. The statistical analysis was used to achieve an optimal and scaled-up device. The optimal configuration of the microdevice was then evaluated by numerical and experimental studies. Numerical simulations for the oil-ethanol and water–ethanol systems were performed for the Reynolds number range of 0.001 – 100. The microdevice provided high mixing indexes (M > 0.97) with relatively low pressure drops. Also, the optimal design was numerically evaluated as a reactor in continuous biodiesel synthesis. The superior oil conversion (87.59%) was obtained for the residence time of 60 s. Finally, the optimal configuration was scaled-up to a reactor volume of 2.36 mL and a prototype was manufactured by 3D printing and used in the experimental synthesis of (Z)-5-(4-hydroxybenzylidene)thiazolidine-2,4-dione (HBT). The reactant conversion obtained from the 3D printed device was equivalent to the performance of a commercial capillary microreactor, but with higher throughput. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Biodiesel synthesis; Flow chemistry; Microfluidics; Numerical simulation; Process intensification","3D printers; Biodiesel; Computational fluid dynamics; Computer aided design; Ethanol; Fuel additives; Mixers (machinery); Mixing; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Reynolds number; Statistical methods; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Biodiesel synthesis; Design optimization; Flow chemistry; Fluid mixing; Micro mixers; Plate columns; Process intensification; Scale-up; Design of experiments","","","","","Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2014/07757-2, 2016/20842-4); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (404760/2016-3)","The authors would like to thank the financial support provided by CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, Process 404760/2016-3) and FAPESP (São Paulo Research Foundation, Process 2014/07757-2, Process 2016/20842-4).

In this work, we present the analysis, fabrication, and experimental results of a novel, fully 3-D printable differential capacitive anemometric sensor for low-power applications. The system exploits a multimaterial fused deposition modeling (FDM) technology to print standard polylactic acid (PLA) filament as well as electrically conductive filament, employed to implement a differential capacitive air pressure sensor, embedded in a printed spherical structure, able to measure the wind speed. A theoretical analysis for the mechanical structure design, focusing on the 3-D printed bending behavior, as well as for fluid dynamics of the sensor and the electronic circuitry design has been conducted. Simulations and measurements of the fabricated prototype have demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed wind sensor. Differential capacitive variations have been observed by applying constant airflow through the sensor, showing a good agreement with the simulated behavior.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.","3-D print; anemometry; differential capacitive sensor","3D printers; Capacitive sensors; Structural design; Wind; 3d prints; Analysis techniques; Anemometric sensor; Anemometry; Development technique; Differential capacitive sensors; Frequency-division- multiplexing; Programmable logic array; Three-dimensional display; Three-dimensional-printing; Frequency division multiplexing","","","","","","","Xu Y., Et al., The boom in 3D-printed sensor technology, Sensors, 17, (2017); Emon M., Choi J., Flexible piezoresistive sensors embedded in 3D printed tires, Sensors, 17, (2017); Ota H., Et al., Application of 3D printing for smart objects with embedded electronic sensors and systems, Adv.

However, the intrinsic low throughput and comparatively low strength of FFF have posed major hurdles for large-scale industrial applications. In this work, high strength PA6-CF composite parts containing up to 35 wt% CF are additively manufactured by directly feeding the composite pellets into a custom-designed screw-extrusion 3D printer. The effects of CF content on the rheological and mechanical properties of the PA6-CF composites are investigated in detail. Mechanical tests show that CF significantly enhances the strength of the 3D-printed composites. With 25 wt% CF, the tensile strength reaches maximum at 169.7 MPa, which is 3.2 times higher than the unfilled PA6, and is also among the highest for the 3D printed CFRPs reinforced by short fibers. In-depth microstructural characterization reveals the printed part retains long carbon fibers (average length over 200 μm) and has comparatively low porosity (2.93% at 25 wt% CF), which are conducive to achieve high mechanical strength. The mechanical strength also agrees reasonably well with the analytical model based on Kelly-Tyson equation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3D-printing; Carbon fibers; Mechanical properties; Screw-extrusion","3D printers; Additives; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Extrusion; Screws; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Carbon fiber reinforced; Carbon-fibre reinforced plastics; High-strength; Mechanical; On demands; Plastic structure; Polyamide 6; Screw extrusion; Tensile strength","","","","","Project of Key Laboratory of Urban Rail Transit Intelligent Operation and Maintenance Technology & Equipment of Zhejiang Province, (ZSDRTZZ2020003); Zhejiang Province, (2022C01163); Zhejiang Normal University, (2020ZS04); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LQ22A02005, LQ22E010001, LY20E0500008)","The research work was supported by Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province , China ( LQ22E010001 , LQ22A02005 , LY20E0500008 ), Pioneer and Leading Goose R&D Program of Zhejiang Province ( 2022C01163 ), Project of Key Laboratory of Urban Rail Transit Intelligent Operation and Maintenance Technology & Equipment of Zhejiang Province , China ( ZSDRTZZ2020003 ) and Self-Topic Fund of Zhejiang Normal University ( 2020ZS04 ).

The as-built (AB) LPBF IN625 alloy had a typical non-equilibrium microstructure consisting of fine dendritic and cellular microstructures, Laves phase and high-density tangled dislocations. The non-equilibrium microstructure transformed into uniform recrystallized microstructure after solution treatment (ST). During long-term thermal exposure, δ phase in AB sample preferentially nucleated in inter-dendritic regions with high-density dislocations, while δ phase in ST specimen firstly nucleated at grain boundaries (GBs) and then grew into grains. The coarsening rate of δ phase in AB sample was lower and the size of δ phase was smaller than those in ST sample. The coarsening of Laves phase at GBs led to the depleted-δ zone in AB sample, which was not found in ST sample. For AB and ST samples, the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and yield strength (YS) increased with the increase of thermal exposure time, while the elongation (EI) decreased. The tensile strength of AB sample was higher than that of ST sample during the thermal exposure at 700 °C, while their tensile strength was close during the thermal exposure at 750 °C. In addition, the anisotropy of mechanical properties of AB LPBF IN625 alloy was eliminated gradually during long-term thermal exposure. The microstructure evolution of LPBF IN625 alloy during long-term thermal exposure was explained by a newly proposed mold. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Laser powder bed fusion; Mechanical property; Microstructure evolution; Ni-Based superalloy; Thermal exposure","Coarsening; Density (specific gravity); Nickel alloys; Ostwald ripening; Superalloys; Tensile strength; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Laves phasis; Laves-phase; Microstructure evolutions; Ni-based superalloys; Non-equilibrium microstructure; Powder bed; Solution treatments; Thermal exposure; Grain boundaries","","","","","Shanghai Sailing Program, (19YF1417500); Shandong University, SDU; Shanghai Jiao Tong University, SJTU","Funding text 1: This work was financially supported by Shanghai Sailing Program (No. 19YF1417500).

All of biQAMAs were confirmed by 1H-NMR spectra and incorporated into Bis-GMA/TEGDMA (60 wt/40 wt) resin matrix with a mass fraction of 5 wt% as antibacterial agent. The obtained resin matrixes were mixed with commercial silaned glass fillers at a mass ratio of 30 wt/70 wt to prepare antibacterial DRCs. The double bond conversion (DC), antibacterial activity against S. mutans., surface charge density, water contact angle, water sorption (WS) and solubility (SL), mechanical properties, and cytotoxicity of biQAMAs containing DRCs were investigated. The DRC without biQAMAs was used as control. The results showed that all biQAMAs containing DRCs had antibacterial rate higher than 90%, and DRC with biQAMA-12 had the highest antibacterial rate due to its highest surface charge density. Adding 5 wt% of biQAMAs would not bring out negative effect on physicochemical properties of DRCs, except for increasing WS, but the resultant WS still met the ISO requirement on WS of restorative materials. Both biQAMA-14 and biQAMA-16 containing DRCs showed higher cytotoxicity than control, thus biQAMA-12 was considered as the optimal antibacterial agent in this research. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Antibacterial activity; Bi-quaternary ammonium methacrylate; Cytotoxicity; Dental resin composites; Physicochemical properties","Ammonium Compounds; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anticestodal Agents; Bisphenol A-Glycidyl Methacrylate; Composite Resins; Materials Testing; Methacrylates; Water; Contact angle; Cytotoxicity; Density (specific gravity); Dental composites; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Resins; Surface charge; 2,2 bis[4 (2hydroxy 3 methacryloyloxypropyl)phenyl]propane; alkyl group; biquaternary ammonium methacrylate 12; biquaternary ammonium methacrylate 14; biquaternary ammonium methacrylate 16; filler; methacrylic acid derivative; monomer; quaternary ammonium derivative; resin; silane; triethylene glycol dimethacrylate; unclassified drug; water; ammonium derivative; anticestodal agent; antiinfective agent; bisphenol A bis(2 hydroxypropyl) ether dimethacrylate; methacrylic acid; resin; Anti-bacterial activity; Antibacterials; Bi-quaternary ammonium methacrylate; Dental resin composites; Physicochemical property; Quaternary ammonium; Resin matrix; Surface charge densities; Synthesised; Water sorption; adsorption; animal cell; antibacterial activity; Article; cell viability; chemical parameters; comparative study; compressive strength; contact angle; controlled study; cytotoxicity; density; double bond conversion; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug potency; drug synthesis; flexural strength; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; mass ratio; mechanics; molecular weight; mouse; NCTC clone 929 cell line; nonhuman; physical chemistry; physical parameters; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; restorative dentistry; rigidity; Streptococcus mutans; surface charge; tensile strength; water solubility; chemistry; materials testing; Physicochemical properties","","silane, 7803-62-5; triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 109-16-0; water, 7732-18-5; bisphenol A bis(2 hydroxypropyl) ether dimethacrylate, 1565-94-2; methacrylic acid, 18358-13-9, 79-41-4; Ammonium Compounds, ; Anti-Bacterial Agents, ; Anticestodal Agents, ; Bisphenol A-Glycidyl Methacrylate, ; Composite Resins, ; Methacrylates, ; Water, ","","","Basic and Applied Basic Research Major Program of Guangdong Province, (2020B1515120001); Discipline Construction Project of Guangdong Medical University, (4SG21019G); Special funds for key areas of ordinary universities in Guangdong Province, (2020ZDZX2013); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81970974); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","We thank the Basic and Applied Basic Research Major Program of Guangdong Province ( 2020B1515120001 ), the Special funds for key areas of ordinary universities in Guangdong Province ( 2020ZDZX2013 ), the Discipline Construction Project of Guangdong Medical University ( 4SG21015G , 4SG21019G ), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 81970974 ).","Antonucci J., Zeiger D., Tang K., Lin-Gibson S., Fowler B., Lin N., Synthesis and characterization of dimethacrylates containing quaternary ammonium functionalities for dental applications, Dent.
