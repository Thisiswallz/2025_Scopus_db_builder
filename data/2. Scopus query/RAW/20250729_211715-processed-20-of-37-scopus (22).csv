However, systematic research on its heat treatment (HT) patterns is scarce. This paper utilizes direct aging (DA), annealing treatment (AT), and solution-aging treatment (SAT) to investigate porosity, microstructure, and mechanical properties. The porosities of as-deposited (AD), DA, and AT samples remained at <1.1%, while the nanopores at the molten pool boundary of AD sample expanded into the molten pool inner of DA and AT samples. For the condition SAT, the porosity exceeded 4.8% accompanied by large-sized micropores. Porosity development resulted from the entrapped hydrogen diffusion along the eutectic Si interface. The HT had little effect on the TiB2 particles and near-equiaxed grains. The eutectic networks of AD and DA samples broke into separate particles after the AT and transformed into coarser particles in the SAT sample. The nanoscale (Si + β′′) and β′ precipitates were exhibited for the DA and SAT samples, respectively, while there are also a few composite precipitates. The evolution of eutectic and precipitates was related to the diffusion of supersaturated solutes. Due to the significant contribution of Orowan strengthening (∼213.1 MPa), a superior combination of the ultimate tensile strength (∼521.6 MPa) and yield strength (∼389.9 MPa) was realized after the DA. The excellent elongation (∼19.3%) of AT sample was attributed to the eutectic spheroidization. However, the high porosity of SAT sample severely compromised mechanical properties. This work provides essential guidance for HT selection of SLM-ed particle-reinforced Al–Si–Mg composites. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Heat treatment patterns; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Porosity; Selective laser melted; TiB<sub>2</sub>/Al–Si–Mg composite","Eutectics; Heat treatment; Tensile strength; Textures; Ageing treatments; Al-Si-Mg; Annealing treatments; Direct aging; Heat treatment pattern; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Molten pool; Selective laser melted; Solution-aging; TiB2/al–si–mg composite; Porosity","","","","","State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing, SKLSP, (SKLSP202110); State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing, SKLSP; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (3102020MS0402, 3102022gxb001); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. 3102020MS0402 and Grant No. 3102022gxb001 ) and the fund of the State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing in NWPU (Grant No. SKLSP202110 ).","Gonzalez C., Vilatela J.J., Molina-Aldareguia J.M., Lopes C.S., LLorc J., Structural composites for multifunctional applications: current challenges and future trends, Prog.

Recently, origami techniques’ potential in mechanical reinforcement for structural designs has also been discussed. For example, the mechanical performance of origami tubular structures can be significantly improved compared with the circular and hexagonal tubes under lateral loading. In this paper, an origami-inspired tubular structure was applied as the infill pattern for additive manufacturing, and energy absorption performance under dynamic and static loadings was investigated. Fused filament fabrication was selected as the testbed for the origami-inspired infill pattern investigation.

The development of injection molding tools is an expensive, time-consuming, and resource-intensive process offering little to no flexibility to adapt to variations in product design. Metal additive manufacturing can be used to produce these tools in a cost-effective way. Nevertheless, in an industrial context, effective methods are missing for the selection of the most suitable technology for the given tooling project. This paper presents a method to compare process chains based on additive and conventional subtractive technologies for the manufacturing of metal tooling for injection molding. The comparison is based on a technology focused-performance analysis (TFPA) through computer simulation performed using Tecnomatix Plant Simulation developed by Siemens Digital Industries Software combined with a customized cost–benefit economic analysis tool. The analysis of the technology comparison highlights potential bottlenecks for production, such as the printing phase and the heat treatment. It also gives a deeper understanding of the technology maturity level of conventional milling machines against laser powder bed fusion machines. The result is that the total costs for an insert made by AM and CM are indeed rather similar (the cost difference between the two tooling process chains is lower than 5%). The cost analysis reveals major costs drivers in the production of high-performance molding tools, such as the cutting tools employed for the milling steps and their changeover frequency. The industrial case of a 32-cavity mold insert for plastic injection molding is used to perform the study, develop the analysis, and validate the results. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; cost comparison; industry 4.0; plant simulation; subtractive manufacturing; technology comparison; value chain","","","","","","European Union’s Horizon 2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie; Precision Additive Metal Manufacturing, (12/10/2022); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (721383)","The project received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 721383, for the Precision Additive Metal Manufacturing (PAM2) project (https://pam2.eu/, accessed on 12/10/2022).","Cicconi P., Mandolini M., Favi C., Campi F., Germani M., Metal Additive Manufacturing for the Rapid Prototyping of Shaped Parts: A Case Study, Comput.-Aided Des.

They can provide in vitro models that recapitulate functions of the original tissue in the body and have applications in cancer research. For example, they are widely used in organ-on-chip systems. Microsensors can provide essential real-time information on cell metabolism as well as the reliability and quality of culture conditions. The combination of sensors and 3D cell cultures, especially single spheroids, is challenging in terms of reproducible formation, manipulation, and access to spheroids, precise positioning near sensors, and high cell-to-volume ratios to obtain meaningful biosignals in the most parallel approach possible. To overcome this challenge, we combined state-of-the-art bioprinting techniques to automatically print tumour spheroids directly into microwells of a chip-based electrochemical oxygen sensor array. We demonstrated highly accurate and reproducible spheroid formation (diameter of approx. 200 μm) and a spheroid deposition precision of 25 μm within a volume of 22 nl per droplet. Microstructures and hydrogel-coated microwells allowed the placement of single MCF-7 breast cancer spheroids close to the sensor electrodes. The microelectrode wells were sealed for oxygen measurements within a 55 nl volume for fast concentration changes. Accurate and stable amperometric oxygen sensor performance was demonstrated from atmospheric to anoxic regions. Cellular respiration rates from single tumour spheroids in the range of 450-850 fmol min−1 were determined, and alterations of cell metabolism upon drug exposure were shown. Our results uniquely combine bioprinting with 3D cell culture monitoring and demonstrate the much-needed effort for facilitation, parallelization, sensor integration, and drug delivery in 3D cell culture and organ-on-chip experiments. The workflow has a high degree of automation and potential for scalability. In order to achieve greater flexibility in the automation of spheroid formation and trapping, we employed a method based on drop-on-demand liquid handling systems, instead of the typical on-chip approach commonly used in microfluidics. Its relevance ranges from fundamental metabolic research over standardization of cell culture experiments and toxicological studies, to personalized medicine, e.g. patient-specific chemotherapy. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Bioprinting; Humans; Microelectrodes; Neoplasms; Oxygen; Reproducibility of Results; Spheroids, Cellular; Automation; Cell culture; Chemotherapy; Deposition; Diseases; Drug delivery; Metabolism; Molecular biology; Oxygen sensors; Ruthenium compounds; Tumors; hydrogel; oxygen; 3-D cell culture; Bioprinting; Cancer cells; Cell metabolism; Cell spheroids; In-vitro models; Micro wells; On chips; Organoids; Tumor spheroid; accuracy; amperometry; Article; bioprinting; breast cancer; breathing rate; cancer cell; cell metabolism; cell respiration; cell viability; drug delivery system; drug exposure; human; human cell; MCF-7 cell line; microfluidics; oxygen sensing; personalized medicine; reliability; reproducibility; standardization; three dimensional cell culture; tumor spheroid; viscosity; microelectrode; multicellular spheroid; neoplasm; procedures; Microelectrodes","","oxygen, 7782-44-7; Oxygen, ","","","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (161L0235B)","We thank Tobias Lange for his assistance with cell culture.

To introduce a more biomimetic approach, we examined blending and stratifying methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HAMA) and methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) bioinks to mimic the zonal structure of articular cartilage. Bioinks were suspended with porcine chondrocytes before being printed in a digital light processing approach. Homogenous constructs made from hybrid bioinks of varying polymer ratios as well as stratified constructs combining different bioink blends were cultivated over 14 days and analyzed by histochemical staining for proteoglycans/collagen type II, cartilage marker expression analysis, and for cellular viability. The stiffness of blended bioinks increased gradually with HAMA content, from 2.41 ± 0.58 kPa (5% GelMA, 0% HAMA) to 8.84 ± 0.11 kPa (0% GelMA, 2% HAMA). Cell-laden constructs maintained vital chondrocytes and supported the formation of proteoglycans and collagen type II. Higher concentrations of GelMA resulted in increased formation of cartilaginous matrix proteins and a more premature phenotype. However, decreased matrix production in central areas of constructs was observed in higher GelMA content constructs. Biomimetically stratified constructs retained their gradient-like structure even after ECM formation, and exclusively exhibited a significant increase in COL2A1 gene expression (+178%). Concluding, we showed the feasibility of blending and stratifying photopolymerizable, natural biopolymers by SLA bioprinting to modulate chondrocyte attributes and to create zonally segmented ECM structures, contributing to improved modeling of cartilaginous tissue for regenerative therapies or in vitro models. © 2022 The Authors.

This study elucidated the effects of early-age material rheology, printing time interval and printing path on the late-age load versus crack mouth opening displacement relation, fracture process zone, fracture toughness and fracture energy of 3D printed concrete materials with notch locations at interlayers vs filaments. A dynamic oscillation stress sweep method was used to reveal the time-dependency of early-age rheological parameters. A novel fracture experiment was designed to integrate a digital image correlation system to enable closed-loop control, measurement, and visualization of crack tip parameters during the rapid fracture processes along the printing interlayers or filaments. The results revealed that the fracture characteristics of 3D printed concrete are strongly influenced by its rheology and time-dependency of rheology, which is fundamentally different from normal cast concrete. Increasing the printing time interval increases the storage modulus, yield stress and complex viscosity of 3D printed concrete materials at different shear stress levels, consequently increasing the likelihood of imperfections, and thus decreasing the maximum process zone size developed at the crack tip, fracture toughness and fracture energy of 3D printed concrete. Such effects were found to be stronger on the fracture characteristics of printing interlayers than filaments. © 2022 The Author(s)","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Complex viscosity; Concrete; Fracture process zone; Fracture toughness; Interlayer; Printing time; Rheology; Storage modulus","Additives; Concretes; Construction industry; Crack propagation; Crack tips; Elastic moduli; Elasticity; Fracture toughness; Shear stress; Space research; Viscosity; Yield stress; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Complex viscosity; Concrete; Early age; Fracture characteristics; Fracture process zone; Interlayer; Printing time; Time interval; 3D printers","","","","","California Energy Commission, CEC, (EPC-17-023); University of California, Irvine, UCI","The authors gratefully acknowledge support by the California Energy Commission under Prime Agreement No. EPC-17-023, RCAM Technologies and the University of California, Irvine for this research.","pp. 25-36, (2018); Hager I., Golonka A., Putanowicz R., 3D printing of buildings and building components as the future of sustainable construction?, Procedia Eng., 151, pp. 292-299, (2016); Reiter L., Wangler T., Roussel N., Flatt R.J., pp. 86-95, (2018); Lim S., Buswell R.A., Le T.T., Austin S.A., Gibb A.G., Thorpe T., pp. 262-268, (2012); Moini M., Olek J., Youngblood J.P., Magee B., Zavattieri P.D., Additive manufacturing and performance of architectured cement-based materials, Adv.

With metastable α′ martensites commonly present in a columnar prior-β grain structure, Ti-6Al-4V alloy made by laser powder-bed fusion additive manufacturing (L-PBF AM) is strong but often suffers from anisotropic mechanical behavior, inferior ductility and low fracture toughness. This drives the recent development in L-PBF process optimisation to produce ultrafine lamellar α + β microstructures directly in the as-built state of Ti-6Al-4V. Currently, in-situ martensite decomposition is deemed as the transformation pathway responsible for the formation of such lamellar microstructures. However, without solid experimental evidence this consensus cannot be reached and is still in question. Here we show that, instead of martensite decomposition, a pathway of slow cooling from the β phase field at much reduced cooling rates (below 5 °C s−1) is proven to give rise to the observed lamellar α + β microstructure. This is underpinned by several microstructural “fingerprints” such as grain-boundary α (GB-α), α colony and α lath width, and crystallographic orientations of the constituent phases. The finding deepens our established wisdom in L-PBF AM and opens a new avenue for microstructural control in metal additive manufacturing. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Laser powder-bed fusion additive manufacturing; Microstructural evolution; Phase transformations; Thermal history; Titanium alloy","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Cooling; Fracture toughness; Grain boundaries; Lamellar structures; Martensite; Microstructural evolution; Optimization; Powder metals; Ternary alloys; Cyclic heating; Heating and cooling; Laser powder-bed fusion additive manufacturing; Laser powders; Metal additives; Phases transformation; Powder bed; Thermal history; Titanium (alloys); Transformation pathways; Titanium alloys","","","","","Deakin University; China Scholarship Council, CSC","This work is supported by a Deakin University start-up funding, Deakin University Postgraduate Research Scholarship (DUPRS), and scholarship from China Scholarship Council (CSC).

To facilitate the use of bioprinting as a standard technique in biology, an open-source device based on a consumer-grade 3D stereolithography apparatus (SLA) printer is developed. This SLA bioprinter can produce complex constructs that preserve cell viability and recapitulate the physiology of tissues. The detailed documentation of the modifications apported to the printer as well as a throughout performance analysis allow for a straightforward adoption of the device in other labs and its customization for specific applications. Given the low cost, several modified bioprinters could be simultaneously operated for a parallelized tissue production. To showcase the capability of the bioprinter, constructs consisting of patient-derived cholangiocarcinoma organoids encapsulated in a gelatin methacrylate (GelMA)/polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogel are produced. A thorough characterization of different GelMA/PEGDA ratios reveals that the mechanical properties of the bioprinted tumor model can be accurately fine-tuned to mimic a specific tumor micro-environment. Immunofluorescence and gene expression analyses of tumor markers confirm that the bioprinted synthetic hydrogel provides a flexible and adequate replacement of animal-derived reconstituted extracellular matrix. © 2022 The Authors.

Micro-grippers are devices based on a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) preferred for manipulation and assembly in micro-fabrication. This article presents the modeling, fabrication, and experimental studies of a U-type electrothermal MEMS micro-gripper. The fabrication of the gripper was made by SLA, which is one of the additive manufacturing methods. The arm tip displacement of the gripper has been characterized in real-time by optical microscopy. In electrical characterization studies, the electrical voltage was applied to the pads of the micro-gripper. This voltage value was increased starting from 0V with 1V increments until deterioration was observed in the gripper. The micro-gripper is shown to actuate to a maximum opening displacement of 28.35 μm at an applied voltage of 5V. The models are employed to examine key factors of the micro-gripper’s performance including temperature distribution, displacement, and stresses based on an elastic analysis of structures. Experimental results for the displacement of the micro-gripper’s arm tips were found to be in good agreement with the simulation results. © 2022, ASM International.","additive manufacturing; electrical characterization; electrothermal actuation; MEMS; stereolithography; tip displacement","Additives; Deterioration; Fabrication; MEMS; Stereolithography; Displacement value; Electrical characterization; Electrothermal actuation; Low actuation voltage; Manufacturing methods; MEMS (microelectromechanical system); Micro gripper; Micro-fabrication; Real- time; Tip displacement; Grippers","","","","","","","Syms R.R., Wright S., MEMS Mass Spectrometers: The Next Wave of Miniaturization, J.

This study has been conducted to select optimum parameters of FDM and vapour smoothing (chemical finishing) process to maximize surface finish, hardness, and dimensional accuracy. A self-adaptive cuckoo search algorithm for predictive modelling of surface and dimensional features of vapour-smoothened FDM-printed functional prototypes has been demonstrated. The chemical finishing has been performed on hip prosthesis (benchmark) using hot vapours of acetone (using dedicated experimental set-up). Based upon the selected design of experiment technique, 18 sets of experiments (with three repetitions) were performed by varying six parameters. Afterwards, a self-adaptive cuckoo search algorithm was implemented by formulating five objective functions using regression analysis to select optimum parameters. An excellent functional relationship between output and input parameters has been developed using a self-adaptive cuckoo search algorithm which has successfully found the solution to optimization issues related to different responses. The confirmatory experiments indicated a strong correlation between predicted and actual surface finish measurements, along with hardness and dimensional accuracy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Dimensional accuracy; Fused deposition modeling; Hardness; Self-adaptive cuckoo search algorithm; Surface finish","","","","","","","","Boschetto A., Bottini L., Roughness prediction in coupled operations of fused deposition modeling and barrel finishing, J Mater Process Technol, 219, pp. 181-192, (2015); Peng A., Xiao X., Yue R., Process parameter optimization for fused deposition modeling using response surface methodology combined with fuzzy inference system, Int J Adv Manuf Tech, 73, pp. 87-100, (2014); Vasudevarao B., Natarajan D.P., Henderson M., Sensitivity of RP surface finish to process parameter variation, Proc. of 11Th Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium, pp. 252-258, (2000); Dudek P., FDM 3D printing technology in manufacturing composite elements, Arch Metall Mater, 58, 4, pp. 1415-1418, (2013); Melocchi A., Briatico-Vangosa F., Uboldi M., Parietti F., Turchi M., von Zeppelin D., Zidan A., Et al., Quality considerations on the pharmaceutical applications of fused deposition modeling 3D printing, Int J Pharm, 592, (2021); Tareq M.S., Rahman T., Hossain M., Dorrington P., Additive manufacturing and the COVID-19 challenges: An in-depth study, J Manuf Syst, 2021, (2021); Longhitano G.A., Nunes G.B., Candido G., da Silva J.V.L., The role of 3D printing during COVID-19 pandemic: a review, Progress Addit Manuf, 6, 1, pp. 19-37, (2021); Cali M., Pascoletti G., Gaeta M., Milazzo G., Ambu R., New filaments with natural fillers for FDM 3D printing and their applications in biomedical field, Procedia Manuf, 51, pp. 698-703, (2020); Sathies T., Senthil P., Anoop M.S., A review on advancements in applications of fused deposition modelling process, Rapid Prototyp J, 2020, (2020); Jain P., Kuthe A.M., Feasibility study of manufacturing using rapid prototyping: FDM approach, Procedia Eng, 63, pp. 4-11, (2013); Singh T.B., Chohan J.S., Kumar R., Performance analysis of vapour finishing apparatus for surface enhancement of FDM parts, Mater Today Proc, 26, 3, pp. 3497-3502, (2020); Kumar A., Alam Z., Khan D.A., Jha S., Nanofinishing of FDM-fabricated components using ball end magnetorheological finishing process, Mater Manuf Process, 34, 2, pp. 232-242, (2019); Mali H.S., Prajwal B., Gupta D., Kishan J., Abrasive flow finishing of FDM printed parts using a sustainable media, Rapid Prototyp J, 2018, (2018); Jayanth N., Senthil P., Prakash C., Effect of chemical treatment on tensile strength and surface roughness of 3D-printed ABS using the FDM process, Virt Phys Prototyp, 13, 3, pp. 155-163, (2018); Gajdos I., Spisak E., Kascak L., Krasinskyi V., Surface finish techniques for FDM parts, Materials Science Forum, 818, pp. 45-48, (2015); Perez Dewey M., Ulutan D., Development of laser polishing as an auxiliary post-process to improve surface quality in fused deposition modeling parts, International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference, 50732, (2017); Roach D.J., Roberts C., Wong J., Kuang X., Kovitz J., Zhang Q., Qi H.J., Et al., Surface modification of fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printed substrates by inkjet printing polyimide for printed electronics, Addit Manuf, 36, (2020); Saad M.S., Nor A.M., Baharudin M.E., Zakaria M.Z., Aiman A.F., Optimization of surface roughness in FDM 3D printer using response surface methodology, particle swarm optimization, and symbiotic organism search algorithms, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 105, 12, pp. 5121-5137, (2019); Boschetto A., Giordano V., Veniali F., Surface roughness prediction in fused deposition modelling by neural networks, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 67, 9-12, pp. 2727-2742, (2013); Mahapatra S.S., Sood A.K., Bayesian regularization-based Levenberg–Marquardt neural model combined with BFOA for improving surface finish of FDM processed part, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 60, 9-12, pp. 1223-1235, (2012); Vahabli E., Rahmati S., Improvement of FDM parts’ surface quality using optimized neural networks–medical case studies, Rapid Prototyp J, 23, (2017); Raju M., Gupta M.K., Bhanot N., Sharma V.S., A hybrid PSO–BFO evolutionary algorithm for optimization of fused deposition modelling process parameters, J Intell Manuf, 30, 7, pp. 2743-2758, (2019); ISO 4287/1 Surface Roughness-Terminology-Part 1: Surface and Its Parameters, (1987); ASTM D2240-05 standard test method for rubber property: Durometer hardness, West Conshohocken: ASTM, (2010); Geometrical Product Specifications (GPS)–acceptance and Reverification Tests for Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMM)–part 2: Cmms Used for Measuring Linear Dimensions, (2009); Kennedy J., Bare bones particle swarms, Swarm Intelligence Symposium, 2003.

The alloy ingot with ~110 mm in diameter and ~120 mm in height was prepared by vacuum electron beam melting. The ingot formed a single body-centered cubic (BCC) solid solution phase, with lattice parameters of 3.244 Å, thereby possessing a good combination of compressive stress (1973 MPa) and strain (17.63%). And this increased the difficulty to pulverize it into fine powder. It was found that hydrogenated treatment can embrittle the ingot, and irregular powders with the particle size ranging from 1.56 µm to 59.5 µm were then easily obtained by using a disk crusher. Finally, highly spheroidized RHEA powders with spheroidization ratio of 95.3% were fabricated by plasma spheroidization. After the plasma treatment, the powders possessed an average particle size of 37.5 µm and a single BCC phase structure was also obtained. The flow property and apparent density were 15.09 s•(50 g)−1 and 7.42 g•cm−3 respectively, indicating a better spheroidization effect. The nano-microhardness of the RHEA powder was 7.99 GPa, which was about 1.68 GPa higher than that of the bulky RHEA with the same composition. These excellent properties endow RHEA powder with broader potential applications, such as protective coatings, additive manufacturing. More importantly, this study provides a new approach to prepare spherical RHEA powder, which is of great significance for the further development. © 2022","Hydrogenated treatment; Plasma spheroidization; Refractory high-entropy alloy; Spherical powder technology; WTaMoNbZr","Additives; Crystal structure; Entropy; High-entropy alloys; Hydrogenation; Melting; Particle size analysis; Plasma applications; Powders; Protective coatings; Spheres; Titanium alloys; Vacuum applications; Alloy powder; High entropy alloys; Hydrogenated treatment; Plasma spheroidization; Powder Technology; Refractory high-entropy alloy; Spherical powder technology; Spherical powders; Spheroidization; Synthesised; Particle size","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51975582); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFC1902400)","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant N. 2018YFC1902400 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant N. 51975582 ).

The main challenge in additive manufacturing (3D printing) is to design a highly thixotropic cementitious system. This study aims to investigate the use of sepiolite as a rheology modifier as a novel approach to improve the thixotropic behavior and adapt cementitious systems to 3D printing. To understand the influence of sepiolite on rheological properties, a comparative evaluation with nano-montmorillonite was established. The effectiveness of clay addition was also investigated in fly-ash amended cement-based materials. The rheological analysis was done on cement-paste samples containing both clays in terms of their effects on thixotropy, structural build-up, and recovery. A preliminary printability assessment was done with a lab scale printer having a ram extruder. The results show that the incorporation of clays increased the dynamic yield stress and time-dependent evolution of static yield stress. Moreover, the addition of clays improved the thixotropic behavior of cement-based systems, particularly those containing fly-ash. Herein, the sepiolite was found to be more effective compared to nano-montmorillonite in terms of improving thixotropy, structural build-up and recovery. The results showed that use of fly-ash enhances the printability of the mix for the specified extruder and the samples containing 1% nano-montmorillonite or 0.5% sepiolite can be printed. The positive effects of sepiolite were attributed to opposing surface charges of the clay layers and its micro-fibrous microstructure. The findings in this study enabled an in-depth understanding of the rheology and printability of fly-ash amended clay containing printable cement-based mortars. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Mineral additives; Rheology; Sepiolite; Thixotropy; Three-dimensional (3D) printing","Cements; Clay minerals; Concrete additives; Concretes; Elasticity; Fly ash; Yield stress; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Cement-based; Cementitious systems; Comparative evaluations; Mineral additives; Sepiolite; Thixotropic behaviour; Thixotropy; Three-dimensional (3D) printing; 3D printers","","","","","Scientific and Technical Research Council; Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu, TÜBİTAK, (MAG-119 M520); Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu, TÜBİTAK","Funding text 1: This research was conducted by the financial assistance of the Scientific and Technical Research Council (TÜBİTAK) of Turkey Project: MAG-119 M520.

In-situ inspection systems, therefore, need to be developed to detect and compensate for any geometric deviations that appear during the process. This article proposes a noncontact system for the digitization of deposited material layers, based on a contact image sensor extracted from a low-cost flatbed paper scanner. The viability of using this sensor for such a purpose was analyzed by integrating it in a tailor-made test bench with the dual capability of fused filament fabrication and digitizing of deposited layers. The integration procedure includes analysis of the sensor's operating principle, development of the hardware and control routines required for PC operation, and image processing. To validate the integration, two specimen parts were built and digitized in the test bench. The measurements performed on the captured images showed low discrepancies with respect to those obtained on a coordinate measuring machine.  © 1996-2012 IEEE.","Additive manufacturing (AM); contact image sensor (CIS) sensor; flatbed scanner; in-situ digitizing; integration","3D printers; Additives; Integration; Scanning; Additive manufacturing; Additive manufacturing process; Contact image sensor  sensor; Deposited materials; Flatbed scanners; Geometric accuracy; In-situ digitizing; Manufacturing machine; Material layers; Test-bench; Image sensors","","","","","","","Gibson I., Rosen D., Stycker B., Additive Manufacturing Technologies, (2015); Beyer C., Strategic implications of current trends in additive manufacturing, J.

This has advantages but not only in terms of weight reduction. In implant structures, the process of osseointegration is improved, mechanical integration is better, the open cell porous structures resemble a trabecular structure that mimics bone tissue. In this work, we investigated titanium structures made porous by cutting spheres. Based on the patterns of different types of crystal models we created porosity with different strategies. We have shown that there are significant differences in mechanical properties between the porous structures formed with different strategies. We determined the structure that loses the least load-bearing capacity compared to the solid structure, with the same porosity levels and mechanical stresses. We characterized the possibility location and environment of becoming an open cell structure. We performed the calculations with mechanical simulations, which were validated experimentally. The quality of the three-dimensional printing of samples was checked by computed tomography reconstruction analysis.

This study proposes a systematic method of deep transfer learning based on a small image dataset to detect part failures of FDM printers. First, a small FDM process image dataset, including the spaghetti-shape error as defective, was prepared, and images for training and validation were generated using effective image augmentation techniques to enhance the diversity of the original dataset by considering a variation in part shape and visual monitoring conditions. Then, four popular and representative ImageNet pre-trained CNN architectures were selected: (1) VGGNet, (2) GoogLeNet, (3) ResNet, and (4) EfficientNet, and a deep transfer learning matrix of fine-tuning strategies with a partition of the selected models into multiple training sections by considering their pooling layers was proposed to generate systematic training executions. Finally, the performance and computational requirements, including accuracy, F1-score, parameters, memory size, and computing time for the prediction, were evaluated experimentally. The evaluation results reveal that the proposed method is capable of training models a suitable performance systematically for detecting the spaghetti-shape error. Furthermore, ResNet50 yielded an overall high performance with more than 90 % accuracy in a computing time of 1 s on a small computing device. Moreover, Grad-CAM visualization and a demonstration with a low-cost FDM printer verify the feasibility of the best-trained model for actual field monitoring problems. © 2022","Appropriate manufacturing technology; Convolutional neural network; Defect detection; Fused deposition modeling; Spaghetti-shape error; Transfer learning","3D printers; Cams; Convolution; Deep learning; Defects; Deposition; Image enhancement; Large dataset; Learning systems; Multilayers; Printing presses; Transfer learning; Appropriate manufacturing technology; Computing time; Convolutional neural network; Defect detection; Image datasets; Manufacturing technologies; Shape errors; Smallest image; Spaghetti-shape error; Transfer learning; Convolutional neural networks","","","","","Korea Government; Division of Human Resource Development, HRD; Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE, (P0008691); Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (NRF- 2021R1C1C2008026, NRF-2021R1A4A200182412); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology, KIAT; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grants funded by Korea government ( MSIT ) [Grant nos.

In applications such as orthopedic implants, specific performance windows require optimized microstructures in order to obtain desirable properties from multi-phase alloys like Ti–6Al–4V. This research aims to quantify the microscale origins of strain in L-PBF manufactured Ti–6Al–4V by understanding how strain is distributed at the grain and sub-grain scale, the interplay between phase evolution and strain, and examining post-processing strain relief strategies to control these features. Model spinal cage implants were manufactured from Ti–6Al–4V powder via L-PBF and then subjected to strain relieving heat treatment cycles above and below the Ti–6Al–4V β transus as a function of time and cooling rate. Residual strain was then studied via high resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD), and 2D strain maps with sub-micron resolution were generated for each post-processing state. It was found that macroscale thermal strains decreased with heat treatment time, but additional contributions from phase stabilizing residual strains retained primarily in the α′ grains as lattice distortive strain remained. Additionally, the retention of β phase significantly changed the strain and dislocation distribution while reducing overall residual strain. These results were validated and reinforced with 3D mesoscopic micromechanical modeling of strain behavior across simulated microstructures, confirming that the local lattice dilation of α’ martensite is a primary contributor of microscale strain generation and retention in L-PBF Ti–6Al–4V. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","additive manufacturing; Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD); Lattice strains; Residual strains; titanium alloy","Additives; Backscattering; Electron diffraction; Heat treatment; Microstructure; Strain rate; Titanium alloys; Electron back scatter diffraction; Electron backscatter diffraction; Laser powders; Lattice strain; Phase evolutions; Powder bed; Property; Residual strains; Titanium (alloys); 3D printers","","","","","Office of Naval Research, ONR, (N00014-20-1-2788); Office of Naval Research, ONR; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, LLNL, (B646330); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, LLNL; Laboratory Directed Research and Development, LDRD, (18-SI-003); Laboratory Directed Research and Development, LDRD","The authors acknowledge helpful discussions with Dr. Saad A.

The competitiveness of FFF can be enhanced by improving printing quality. However, due to the increasing sustainability issues worldwide, there is an urgent need to lower energy consumption. In this study, we focused on fan rate, printing speed, nozzle temperature, build plate temperature, and layer thickness as factors that directly impact the dimensional accuracy, carbon dioxide emissions, and printing cost of FFF printers. Several single-objective and multiobjective optimization tasks were performed using the Taguchi method and desirability approach to implement sustainable manufacturing decisions. In single-objective optimization, the inner width, outer width, material cost, and labor cost were most easily affected by the layer thickness. The outer length, carbon dioxide emissions, and electricity cost were significantly affected by the build plate temperature. In multiobjective optimization, a different set of printing parameters can be used to optimize dimensional accuracy, carbon dioxide emissions, material cost, labor cost, and electricity cost. This study helps users to obtain optimal solutions under different optimization requirements to cope with diverse manufacturing characteristics. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printer; desirability approach; fused filament fabrication; sustainable manufacturing; Taguchi method","","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (111-2621-M-110-001, MOST 110-2622-E-027-029)","The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Science and Technology, R.O.C., for financial support (MOST 111-2621-M-110-001 and MOST 110-2622-E-027-029).","Calignano F., Manfredi D., Ambrosio E.P., Biamino S., Lombardi M., Atzeni E., Salmi A., Minetola P., Iuliano L., Fino P., Overview on Additive Manufacturing Technologies, Proc.

The greatest challenge currently facing metallic AM is maintaining control of microstructural evolution during solidification and any solid state phase transformations during the build process. Ti-6Al-4V has been extensively surveyed in this regard, with the potential solid state and solidification microstructures explored at length. This work evaluates the applicability of previously determined crystallographic markers of microstructural condition observed in electron beam melting powder bed fusion (PBF-EB) builds of Ti-6Al-4V in a directed energy deposition (DED) build process. The aim of this effort is to elucidate whether or not these specific crystallographic textures are useful tools for indicating microstructural conditions in AM variants beyond PBF-EB. Parent β-Ti grain size was determined to be directly related to α-Ti textures in the DED build process, and the solid state microstructural condition could be inferred from the intensity of specific α-Ti orientations. Qualitative trends on the as-solidified β-Ti grain size were also determined to be related to the presence of a fiber texture, and proposed as a marker for as-solidified grain size in any cubic metal melted by AM. Analysis of the DED Ti-6Al-4V build also demonstrated a near complete fracture of the build volume, suspected to originate from accumulated thermal stresses in the solid state. Crack propagation was found to only appreciably occur in regions of slow cooling with large α+β colonies. Schmid factors for the basal and prismatic α-Ti systems explained the observed crack pathway, including slower bifurcation in colonies with lower Schmid factors of both slip systems. Colony morphologies and localized equiaxed β-Ti solidification were also found to originate from build pauses during production and uneven heating of the build edges during deposition. Tailoring of DED Ti-6Al-4V microstructures with the insight gained here is proposed, along with cautionary insight on preventing unplanned build pauses to maintain an informed and controlled thermal environment for microstructural control. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Cracking; Crystallographic texture; Directed energy deposition; Solidification; Ti-6Al-4V","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Crack propagation; Deposition; Grain size and shape; Ternary alloys; Textures; Titanium alloys; Cracks propagation; Crystallographic textures; Directed energy; Directed energy deposition; Energy depositions; Grainsize; Metallic additives; Microstructural conditions; Schmid factors; Ti-6al-4v; Solidification","","","","","Los Alamos Neutron Science Center; National Science Foundation Industry; Shaun Whetten; University Cooperative Research Center, (1624836); National Science Foundation, NSF, (2019260337); National Science Foundation, NSF; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (89233218CNA000001, DE-NA0003525); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST; U.S. Department of Commerce, DOC; National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA; Los Alamos National Laboratory, LANL; Colorado School of Mines, CSM, (DMR-1828454); Colorado School of Mines, CSM","Funding text 1: AIS gratefully acknowledges the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, USA, under Grant No. 2019260337 for supporting this work.

The homogeneous microstructure can be achieved in L-PBF fabricated (L-PBFed) Ti-41Nb alloy but slight composition segregation was detected along molten pool boundaries. The L-PBFed alloy was dominated by typical epitaxial columnar grains with strong 〈001〉 grain orientation along building direction (BD), and cellular structure was distinguished within the columnar grains. The main reasons for this microstructure can be attributed to effective thermal gradient and epitaxial growth. L-PBFed alloy exhibited higher mechanical strength compared with cold rolling plus annealing (CRA) alloy due to the finer grains, dislocations accumulation and different TRIP behaviors, accompanied by good ductility. It also exhibited much lower thermal conductivity and better hydrophilic feature than those of CP-Ti. Besides, the L-PBFed alloy exhibited slightly better cell spread and cell proliferation rates compared with CP-Ti. Moreover, L-PBFed alloy presented better alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities and extracellular matrix (ECM) mineralization, which suggests that the L-PBFed alloy can stimulate the osteogenic differentiation of rat bone mesenchymal stem cells. The Ti-41Nb alloy, fabricated by L-PBF, reveals a good combination of mechanical properties, physicochemical properties and biocompatibility, exhibiting the great potential as the dental implant. © 2022","In vitro biocompatibility; Laser powder bed fusion; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Ti-41Nb","Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Biocompatibility; Biomechanics; Bone; Cell culture; Cell proliferation; Cold rolling; Dental alloys; Metal implants; Niobium alloys; Phosphatases; Physicochemical properties; Stem cells; Thermal conductivity; Titanium alloys; Columnar grain; Fabricated alloys; In vitro biocompatibility; In-vitro; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; Ti-41nb; Vitro biocompatibilities; β'' type; Microstructure","","","","","TRUMPF; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51821001, 51831011, 51871152); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work is supported financially by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51871152, 51831011 and 51821001 ).

This paper investigates a hybrid printing process called Flash Light Assisted Manufacturing of structural Electronics (FLAME) which integrates Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) of polymers with printing and Intense Pulsed Light sintering (IPL) of silver nanoparticles. The effect of IPL parameters and nanoparticle shape on conductivity is quantified, revealing that using NWs with IPL allows greater conductivity with lesser sintering-induced polymer damage. The conductivity of planar circuits is characterized during over-FFF, i.e., during FFF of the polymer on the sintered circuit. An unexpected finding is that over-FFF increases the conductivity in a complex and non-monotonic manner that depends on the over-FFF parameters. A multi-layer IPL strategy is introduced for through-plane circuits, in which NWs are deposited in increments smaller than the circuit's total height and IPL is performed after each increment. Electromagnetic and thermal simulations reveal why through-plane circuits have lesser conductivity than planar ones and uncover the key role of multi-layer IPL in increasing the conductivity of through-plane circuits. Overall, FLAME increases the conductivity by 300 % for planar circuits and by 170 % for through-plane circuits as compared to state-of-the-art nanoparticle printing-based methods, even for low-thermal-tolerance polymers, in less than 10 s for each polymer layer. These advances break the performance-material-throughput tradeoff that plagues existing nanoparticle-based printing methods for fabricating 3D structural electronics. © 2022","3D electronics; Fused filament fabrication;

By combining different types of aluminum alloys, their functional properties can be expanded. In the present research, two components composed of 2319 (Al-6.5Cu) and 5B06 (Al-6.4Mg) dissimilar alloys were fabricated by wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). The deposited component with the bottom half of 2319 and the top half of 5B06 exhibits better mechanical properties than its counterpart deposited vice versa. Its ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, and elongation are 258.5 MPa, 139.3 MPa, and 5.6%, respectively, which are only slightly inferior to the mechanical properties of 2319 base metal. The results show that for both components, fracture occurred at a layer thickness above the interface layer during the tensile test, regardless of the deposition order. It appears that the thermal stress due to the long dwell time and the remelting of the S-Al2CuMg phase are the main factors promoting crack initiation. Depending on the deposition order, cracks propagate either along the aggregated pores or strip θ-Al2Cu phase distributed along the grain boundary. By analyzing the heat input and selecting the appropriate depositing order, the strength of WAAM dissimilar aluminum alloys can be effectively improved through the proper control of microstructure and internal defects. © 2022","Aluminum alloy; Defects; Dissimilar materials; Mechanical Properties; Microstructure; Wire and arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Copper alloys; Cracks; Deposition; Dissimilar materials; Grain boundaries; Industrial research; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Wire; Base metals; Dissimilar alloys; Functional properties; Layer thickness; Light alloys; Strength and elongations; Two-component; Ultimate tensile strength; Wire and arc additive manufacturing; Yield elongations; Microstructure","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51805415); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2019M663682); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; State Key Laboratory for Mechanical Behavior of Materials, (20212311); State Key Laboratory for Mechanical Behavior of Materials","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51805415), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2019M663682) and the Open Fund of the State Key Laboratory for Mechanical Behavior of Materials (No. 20212311).","Wu B.T., Pan Z.X., Ding D.H., Cuiuri D., Li H.J., Xu J., Norrish J., J.

The results show that laser power 200 W, scanning speed 1200 mm/s, spot diameter 0.1 mm and powder thickness 0.03 mm are the optimal processing parameters. Samples with different pore structures were fabricated by SLM according to the optimized parameters, and scanning electron microscopy images show that the porous structures processed by this process have better fidelity. The compressive strength and elastic modulus of solid and different pore structures were compared and analyzed through compression experiments.

However, little is understood about the conditions that control whether rejuvenation or relaxation will occur, and whether conditions exist that can give structural stability. We address these questions by applying ESC at 90% of the yield stress to both cast and laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) manufactured Zr-based BMG samples in the as-cast, as-built, and different annealed states. The structural state and mechanical properties for each material condition were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and microhardness, respectively, and two representative groups were also used for compression testing. Initial relaxation or rejuvenation was observed for elastostatically compressed as-cast samples, and the behavior reversed over 72 h of ESC. In contrast, no ESC effect was observed for the as-built LPBF samples. It was found that the onset of either relaxation or rejuvenation by ESC could be better predicted if samples were annealed into a controlled initial state. Five different types of initial response to ESC were observed, corresponding to different initial energy state ranges. Materials in the highest and lowest initial energy states were stable against structural changes by ESC. Close to the highest energy state, rejuvenation was dominant, while relaxation took place close to the lowest energy state. At intermediate initial energy states, both relaxation and rejuvenation were observed after ESC loading, suggesting that the glass structure easily finds different local minima in the potential energy landscape. In all cases, relaxation was associated with BMG hardening and rejuvenation was associated with softening. Overall, the results of this study provide new insights into how ESC impacts the structural state and mechanical properties of BMGs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Bulk metallic glass; Differential scanning calorimetry; Elastostatic compression; Microhardness; Relaxation/rejuvenation","Compression testing; Glass; Glass transition; Metallic glass; Microhardness; Potential energy; Stability; Yield stress; As-cast; Bulk metallic glass; Condition; Elastostatic compression; Initial energy; Laser powders; Powder bed; Relaxation/rejuvenation; Structural state; Zr based bulk metallic glass; Differential scanning calorimetry","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP180101393, FT190100484); Australian Research Council, ARC; University of New South Wales, UNSW; University of Sydney, Usyd","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Grant DP180101393.

Polymer matrix composites are used for light-weighting in many industry sectors including automotive and aerospace and are of considerable interest as material feedstocks for AM. Although fused filament fabrication (FFF) based AM is well known to be suitable to process short (chopped or milled) fibre polymer matrix composites to this point much less progress has been made on the FFF of continuous fibre reinforced high-performance polymers. In this research study, a novel FFF heating block was developed and employed to fabricate polyetherimide (PEI) composite components employing continuous carbon fibres (CF) as the reinforcement. The effect of CF sizing agent was explored as a mechanism to improve fibre/matrix compatibility, hence processability and part performance. The successful fabrication of specimens is demonstrated using the technique and build morphology analysed. In addition, the mechanical behaviour of single CF reinforced PEI filaments deposited by FFF is examined in tension and compared and related to that of the plain CF and unreinforced single filaments. It was found that the tensile strength of the reinforced single filaments was nearly triple that of the unreinforced filaments but notably lower than that of the CF, which shows that characteristics such as the fibre/ matrix interface and distribution of fibres within the filaments possibly need to further be improved. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Additive manufacturing; Continuous fibre-reinforced composites; Fused filament fabrication; High-performance polymers","","","","","","Siemens Energy; Deakin University; RMIT University, RMIT","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the facilities and technical assistance of the Advanced Manufacturing Precinct, particularly that of Callum Ellis and Bradley Sherwood, the Australian Microscopy and Microanalysis Research Facility at the RMIT Microscopy and Microanalysis Facility, and the Rheology and Materials Processing Centre at RMIT University.

Cantabria s/n, Burgos, 09006, Spain","Additive manufacturing (AM) of metallic materials is increasingly being adopted in numerous sectors, such as biomedicine, aerospace or automotive industries, due to its versatility in the creation of complex geometries and the minimisation of material waste when compared to traditional subtractive methods. In order to ensure a reliable operation of these parts, however, an in-depth study of the effect of additive manufacturing on mechanical properties, including tensile, fatigue and fracture resistance, is necessary. Among the vast number of methods and materials, this project is focused in one of the most promising techniques for the industry: Selective Laser Melting (SLM) for the production of a tools steel, in particular C300 steel components for the automotive sector. The main objective of this paper is to optimise some of the key parameters in the printing process, such as laser power, laser speed and hatch spacing. These variables are essential to obtain parts with good resistance. To that purpose, tensile tests were performed in 3D printed specimens, and then elastoplastic properties were extracted, organised and analysed through a design of experiments for the subsequent output fitting using the response surface methodology. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; C300 maraging steel; response surface; selective laser melting","","","","","","Next Generation European Union; Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras, FEDER, (MU-21-UP2021-030); Universidad de Oviedo; Junta de Castilla y León, JCYL, (BU-002-P20, INVESTUN/22/BU/0003)","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Junta de Castilla y Leon (Spain) through grants INVESTUN/22/BU/0003 and BU-002-P20, co-financed by FEDER funds.

This study aims to characterize the separation behavior of a photocurable PDMS resin on a hydrogel film whose high-water content is expected to minimize the separation force. For this benchmark study, a commercially available polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and an acrylate-based photopolymer are used as the baselines. Along with two printing speeds, a total of eight cases (two films, two resins, and two speeds) are used in the design of the experiment. A modified digital light processing (DLP) printing with a built-in force sensor is used to sample the force profile during the printing. The results show that PDMS has a lower separation force but longer separation distance than those of the acrylate-based resin. The hydrogel film can further minimize the separation force and distance; those values are under 0.5 N in PDMS printing. A lower speed can further reduce the separation force, but increase separation distance, likely due to the rate-dependent material properties. These results suggest a potential solution to print PDMS fast with small and fragile features. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Hydrogel; PDMS; Vat photopolymerization","Hydrogels; Microchannels; Polydimethylsiloxane; Resins; Silicones; Benchmark study; High water content; Hydrogel films; Photo polymerization; Photocurable; Separation behaviors; Separation distances; Separation force; Softer materials; Vat photopolymerization; Photopolymerization","","","","","","","Al Rashid A., Ahmed W., Khalid M.Y., Koc M., Vat photopolymerization of polymers and polymer composites: processes and applications, Addit.

In this work, airborne acoustic and inline pyrometry measurements were recorded simultaneously with the laser position. X-ray radiography imaging was used to spatio-temporally register keyhole pore locations to the pyrometry and acoustic signals, enabling binary labeling of data partitions based on pore formation. These labeled partitions were subsequently featurized using a highly comparative time-series analysis toolbox. Acoustic data was found to be much more effective than the pyrometry data for keyhole pore identification. However, when the information contained in both sensing modalities was combined in a sensor fusion strategy, the error rates of the top performing models were significantly reduced. © 2022","Laser powder-bed fusion; Pore identification; Sensor fusion","Data handling; Process monitoring; Pyrometers; Time series analysis; X ray radiography; Acoustic measurements; Air-borne acoustic; Fusion technology; In-situ process monitoring; Laser powder-bed fusion; Laser powders; Localised; Pore identification; Powder bed; Sensor fusion; Pyrometry","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (DGE - 1746047); National Science Foundation, NSF; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; Basic Energy Sciences, BES, (E-AC02–05CH11231); Basic Energy Sciences, BES; National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, LLNL, (DE-AC52–07NA27344); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, LLNL; Laboratory Directed Research and Development, LDRD, (20190580ECR, 20220368ER, 89233218CNA000001); Laboratory Directed Research and Development, LDRD","Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) authors were funded by LANL Laboratory Directed Research and Development ( LDRD ) under project numbers 20190580ECR and 20220368ER .

Using atom probe microscopy and cluster search algorithms, this study investigates the degree of Cu clustering and precipitation in 17–4 precipitate hardening (PH) stainless steel fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). It was found that LPBF samples exhibit a greater than random degree of Cu clustering, irrespective of the laser power during fabrication. It is further shown that using a higher laser power (161.5 W rather than 127.5 W) led to a higher number density of Cu clusters, Cu precipitates, and higher hardness due to the greater heat input. The observations of Cu-rich clusters and precipitates within as-printed LPBF samples and its laser power dependence are novel and show potential for inducing desired strengthening phases directly during LPBF, mitigating the need for post-fabrication heat treatments. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive Manufacturing; Atom Probe Tomography; Precipitation; Stainless Steels","Additives; Atom lasers; Heat treatment; Probes; Stainless steel; Atom probe microscopies; Atom-probe tomography; Clusterings; High laser power; Laser powders; Laser power; Number density; Powder bed; Precipitate hardening; Search Algorithms; 3D printers","","","","","UNSW Materials & Manufacturing Futures Institute; University of New South Wales, UNSW; University of Sydney, Usyd; Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, Australian Government","Funding by the AUSMURI program, Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, Australia is acknowledged.

In this work, the influence of mechanical properties on the notch fracture resistance of Ti-6Al-4V produced by Selective Laser Melting is numerically investigated. Literature data is used to inform material behaviour. The as-built brittle behaviour is compared to the enhanced ductile response after heat treatment (HT) and hot isostatic pressing (HIP) post-processes. A Phase Field framework is adopted to capture damage nucleation and propagation from two different notch geometries and a discussion on the influence of fracture energy and the characteristic length is carried out. In addition, the influence of oxygen uptake is analysed by reproducing non-inert atmospheres during HT and HIP, showing that oxygen shifts fracture to brittle failures due to the formation of an alpha case layer, especially for the V-notch geometry. Results show that a pure elastic behaviour can be assumed for the as-built SLM condition, whereas elastic-plastic phenomena must be modelled for specimens subjected to heat treatment or hot isostatic pressing. The present brittle Phase Field framework coupled with an elastic-plastic constitutive analysis is demonstrated to be a robust prediction tool for notch fracture after different post-processing routes. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Finite element modelling; Notch fracture; Phase Field; Ti-6Al-4V","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Elastoplasticity; Finite element method; Fracture; Hot isostatic pressing; Melting; Selective laser melting; Sintering; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Elastic-Plastic; Element models; Finite element modeling; Fracture prediction; Hot-isostatic pressings; Notch fracture; Notch geometry; Phase fields; Selective laser melting; Ti-6al-4v; Oxygen","","","","","Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet, NTNU; UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (MR/V024124/1); UK Research and Innovation, UKRI; Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras, FEDER; Junta de Castilla y León, JCYL, (BU-002-P20); Junta de Castilla y León, JCYL","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Junta of Castile and Leon through grant BU-002-P20, co-financed by FEDER funds.

For instance, it allows to build components with complex geometry, difficult to make in a different way, build integrated parts deleting joining issues, etc. However, its application in engineering fields is still limited because the dependency between the mechanical properties of the obtained components and the manufacturing parameters is not in depth understood. Improve the performances of AM components, under static and dynamic loadings, is crucial to ensure their durability and reliability and in recent years it became a challenging research field. In this work, the effect of the surface roughness on the multiaxial fatigue resistance of Ti6Al4V thin-walled tubular samples, made by the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process, was investigated. In particular, experiments under combined axial–torsional loadings were carried out on two batches of samples, made by different surface roughness (machined and as built samples). Maximum valley depth Rv was used as a representative parameter of the surface roughness as it geometrically represents a stress concentration zone where crack initiates and propagates. An effective strain intensity factor range, based on the modified Smith Watson and Topper (MSWT) model, that includes the roughness parameter Rv, is proposed and used for a better correlation of the fatigue data. To prove the reliability of the proposed model, the Socie and the Reddy & Fatemi effective strain-based intensity factor range were also used but a bigger scattering of results was observed. The MSWT model was also applied to predict the failure plane and the obtained results were compared with the predictions of the Fatemi-Socie model. Results revealed that, for SLM Ti6Al4V alloy components, the MSWT model is more accurate. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Digital image correlation; Multiaxial fatigue; Titanium alloy","Additives;

Currently, 3D printed (3DP) rock analogs fabricated from sandy materials (silica sand) are widely applied to study the petrophysical and geomechanical characteristics of reservoir rocks, which provides an alternative and novel approach for laboratory tests to calibrate the environmental uncertainties, resolve up-scaling issues, and manufacture customized rock specimens with consistent structure and controllable petrophysical properties in a repeatable fashion. In this paper, silica sand with various grain sizes (GS) and Furan resin were used to fabricate rock analogs with different layer thicknesses (LTs) using the binder-jetting 3DP technique. A comprehensive experimental study was conducted on 3DP rock analogs, including helium porosity measurement, micro-CT scanning, SEM, and uniaxial compression. The results indicate that the LT and GS have a great influence on the physical properties, compression strength, and failure behavior of 3DP rock analogs. The porosity decreases (the difference is 7.09%) with the decrease in the LT, while the density and peak strength increase (showing a difference of 0.12 g/cm3 and 5.67 MPa). The specimens printed at the 200 and 300 μm LT mainly experience tensile shear destruction with brittle failure characteristics. The ductility of the 3DP rocks increases with the printing LT. The higher the content of the coarse grain (CG), the larger the density and the lower the porosity of the specimens (showing a difference of 0.16 g/cm3 and 8.8%). The largest peak compression strength with a mean value of 8.53 MPa was recorded in the specimens printed with CG (i.e., 100% CG), and the peak strength experiences a decrease with the increment in the content percentage of the fine grain (FG) (showing a difference of 2.01 MPa). The presented work helps to clarify the controlling factors of the printing process and materials characteristics on the physical and mechanical properties of the 3DP rock analogs, and allows for providing customizable rock analogs with more controllable properties and printing schemes for laboratory tests. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing; compression strength; failure behavior; porosity; sandstone","3D printers; Compressive strength; Computerized tomography; Failure (mechanical); Grain size and shape; Minerals; Nondestructive examination; Petrophysics; Physicochemical properties; Pore structure; Sedimentary rocks; Silica; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Coarse grains; Compression strength; Failure behaviors; Grainsize; Laboratory test; Layer thickness; Peak strength; Physical and mechanical properties; Porosity","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province, (2022NSFSC1161); Southwest University of Science and Technology, SWUST, (20zx7129, 2022NSFC1161); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51909225); UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (103499)","This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China grant number [51909225]; Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan, grant number [2022NSFSC1161], and Doctoral Foundation of SWUST, grant number [20zx7129].

These transients can lead to complexities, most significantly when alloys with multi phases are subjected to AM. Here we unveil such complexities in a duplex stainless steel, where we report an unanticipated formation of a Ni-Mn-Si rich phase at grain boundaries and a local fluctuation in Cr and Fe concentrations in regions close to grain boundaries, providing Cr-rich precursors for Cr2N formation after laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). The formation of these phases is believed to be due to severe thermal gyrations and thermal stresses associated with LPBF resulting in a high-volume fraction of ferrite supersaturated with N and Ni, and a high density of dislocations accelerating diffusion and phase transformations. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Cr<sub>2</sub>N; Grain boundary segregation; Stainless steels","Additives; Chromium steel; Grain boundaries; Manganese steel; Precipitation (chemical); Silicon; Silicon alloys; Silicon steel; Textures; 2205 duplex stainless steel; Chemical fluctuations; Energy distributions; Grain boundary segregation; Grain-boundaries; Intergranular precipitation; Laser powders; Powder bed; Rich phase; Thermal transients; 3D printers","","","","","AUSMURI; Office of Naval Research, ONR, (N00014–18–1–2794); Office of Naval Research, ONR; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Advanced Manufacturing Office, AMO, (DE-AC05–00OR22725); Advanced Manufacturing Office, AMO; Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE; U.S. Navy, USN; University of New South Wales, UNSW, (P0039966, P0041361); University of New South Wales, UNSW; Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU; Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, Australian Government","Funding from the AUSMURI program administered by the Australia's Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources is acknowledged.

Some of these waste materials are hazardous to the environment and the human body. Facing this problem, it is crucial to reduce material usage in AM technologies by recycling. Up until now, extensive attentions have been attracted on material reuse/recycling in AM technologies, however, comparisons of material reuse degree (MRD) are still lacking. Aiming at addressing MRD issues, we developed an improved resolution coefficient grey correlation (IRCGC) method to evaluate MRD in four representative AM technologies, including fused deposition modeling (FDM), stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS), and laminated object manufacturing (LOM). In such an IRCGC method, a grey correlation optimization model was established and a combined analytic hierarchy process and entropy weight method was employed to obtain weights. Afterwards, MRD in 4 AM technologies were assessed by an evaluation system and then were clustered using data analysis software. Experimental results show that among the 4 AM technologies, the FDM technology demonstrated the highest MRD, whereas, the SLA technology exhibited the lowest MRD. The SLS and the LOM AM technologies are classified into the good level. © 2022 The Institution of Chemical Engineers","Additive manufacturing; Combined analytic hierarchy process and entropy weight method; Improved resolution coefficient grey correlation method; Material reuse degree","3D printers; Additives; Correlation methods; Entropy; Laser heating; Sintering; Additive manufacturing technology; Combined analytic hierarchy process and entropy weight method; Entropy weight method; Grey correlation methods; Improved resolution coefficient gray correlation method; Laminated object manufacturing; Large amounts; Material reuse; Material reuse degree; Resolution coefficients; Analytic hierarchy process","","","","","University of Miami, UM; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52175473); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2020YFB1711603); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work is supported by both the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2020YFB1711603 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 52175473 ) and the start-up funds from the College of Engineering and Computing at Miami University , USA.

Among all AM techniques, FDM (Fused Deposition Modelling) represents the most used printing technique to produce polymeric and composite components, thanks to the flexible printing process, the low cost and the diversity of the materials adopted. The aim of the present work concerns the comparison between the mechanical properties of three plastic materials printed with the FDM technique (polylactic acid PLA, polyethylene terephthalate glycol-modified PETG and Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene ABS) using an Original Prusa i3 MK3S, by varying the raster angle between 0°, 45° and 90° degrees. Infrared Thermography has been adopted to monitor the temperature evolution during static tensile tests and to assess stress level that can initiate damage within the material. Failure analysis was performed to correlate the mechanical behaviour with the microstructural characteristics of the materials. © 2022 This is an open access article under the terms of the CC-BY 4.0,.","3D printing; ABS; DfAM; Microstructure; PETG; PLA","ABS resins; Damage detection; Fused Deposition Modeling; Plastic bottles; Polyethylene terephthalates; Tensile testing; Thermography (imaging); 3-D printing; 3D-printing; ABS; Damage assessments; DfAM; Industrial production; Manufacturing techniques; PETG; PLA; Processed materials; Styrene","","","","","","","Turner B.N., Strong R., Gold S.A., A review of melt extrusion additive manufacturing processes: I.

Traditional manufacturing techniques are mostly involved in making these parts. This work is focused on evaluating the as-cast and Selective Laser Melting (SLM) printed Ti64 specimens in terms of microstructure, hardness and corrosion resistance. The microstructure and the hardness of as-cast and SLM printed samples were examined using FESEM with EDS followed by Vickers microhardness test The corrosion resistance offered by both samples at different durations was investigated in an electrochemical workstation followed by the examination of the corroded surface roughness. The results showed that the existence of martensite microstructure in the SLM printed Ti64 sample has paved the way for enhancing the hardness property compared with the as-cast specimen. Furthermore, the corrosion analysis revealed that the formation of strong and compact passive film has been observed on the SLM samples which resist corrosion. This is due to the even distribution of stabilizing elements followed by martensite phase formation with subsequent solidification during the SLM process. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis and surface roughness evaluation also confirm that the SLM samples have a better passive film with higher Rp and lower Ra values, thereby providing greater resistance against corrosion. © IMechE 2022.","corrosion; EIS analysis; microstructure; selective laser melting; surface roughness; Ti-6Al-4 V","Aluminum alloys; Aluminum corrosion; Automotive industry; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant alloys; Corrosive effects; Electrochemical corrosion; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Hardness; Martensite; Melting; Microstructure; Selective laser melting; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; As-cast; Corrosion behaviour; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyse; Electrochemical-impedance spectroscopies; Melting techniques; Micro-structural; Passive films; Selective laser melting; Ti-6al-4 V; Traditional manufacturing; Surface roughness","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST","The authors like to acknowledge the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan for providing the funding.

To compete with conventional ceramic forming methods, the time and cost associated with material and process optimization for ceramic stereolithography should be improved. Computational analysis methods can be utilized to reduce the number of experimental steps required for material and process optimization. This work used the discrete element method and ray tracing analyses to predict suitable material parameters and processing conditions for ceramic stereolithography. The discrete element method was used to create alumina particle dispersion models to predict suitable paste compositions, and ray tracing was used to predict suitable laser power and scan speed to achieve a sufficient curing depth for stereolithography processing. The predicted conditions of paste composition and processing parameters were comparable to experimental values, reducing the number of experimental iterations required for process optimization. Furthermore, suitable processing parameters for high-speed fabrication by stereolithography was predicted, achieving a processing speed much faster than previously reported ceramic stereolithography. The reduction in process optimization timeline, and the increase in fabrication speed, could increase the appeal of ceramic stereolithography to industry. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; alumina; ceramics; discrete element method; ray tracing; stereolithography","","","","","","","","Gibson I., Rosen D., Stucker B., Additive Manufacturing Technologies, (2015); Ford S., Despeisse M., Additive Manufacturing and Sustainability: An Exploratory Study of the Advantages and Challenges, J.

In this study, the finite different method (FDM) and discrete element method (DEM) are coupled to simulate the interaction between an FRP jacket and concrete specimen. Numerical axial compression tests on concrete confined by an FRP jacket are first implemented and analyzed. The mechanical performances considering the effects of micro-parameters are validated using laboratory axial compression tests on FRP-confined concrete specimens. The results show that the post-peak strength of FRP confined concrete is controlled by the ratio of the linear modulus to bond modulus, and the internal friction angle must be corrected during the continuous cracking of contacts; stress accumulates from the end to the center of a specimen and the confined radial stress is about a quarter of the axial pressure; and the level of contact crack can be quantified in the mesoscale, in which the stronger the cracking resistance, the thicker the corresponding jacket, and the greater the compression strength. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Axial compression test; FDM-DEM; FRP-confined concrete; Macro and micro analysis","Axial compression; Compression testing; Cracks; Fiber reinforced plastics; Axial compression tests; Concrete specimens; Discrete element method simulations; Discrete elements method; Fiber reinforced polymer confined concrete; Fiber reinforced polymer jacket; Finite different method-discrete element method; Finite different methods; Macro and micro analyse; Micro analysis; Finite difference method","","","","","Basic Scientific Research Project of Wenzhou, (R2020013); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52178352); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LY20E080030); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF; Science and Technology Plan Project of Wenzhou, China, (ZS2021001); Science and Technology Plan Project of Wenzhou, China","This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52178352), Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (No. LY20E080030), the Plan Project of Science and Technology of Wenzhou (No. ZS2021001), and the Basic Scientific Research Project of Wenzhou (No. R2020013).","Fiore V., Bella G.D., Valenza A., Glass–basalt/epoxy hybrid composites for marine applications, Mater.

One of the hallmarks of glioma is its invasiveness. Furthermore, glioma cells tend to readily detach from the primary tumor and travel through the brain tissue, making complete tumor resection impossible in many cases. To expand the knowledge regarding the invasive behavior of glioma, evaluate drug resistance, and recapitulate the tumor microenvironment, various modeling strategies were proposed in the last decade, including three-dimensional (3D) biomimetic scaffold-free cultures, organ-on-chip microfluidics chips, and 3D bioprinting platforms, which allow for the investigation on patient-specific treatments. The emerging method of 3D bioprinting technology has introduced a time- and cost-efficient approach to create in vitro models that possess the structural and functional characteristics of human organs and tissues by spatially positioning cells and bioink. Here, we review emerging 3D bioprinted models developed for recapitulating the brain environment and glioma tumors, with the purpose of probing glioma cell invasion and gliomagenesis and discuss the potential use of 4D printing and machine learning applications in glioma modelling.  © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.","3D bioprinting; brain cancer; cancer treatment; glioma; in vitro models","3D modeling; Biomimetics; Diseases; Microfluidic chips; biomaterial; 3d bioprinting; Bioprinting; Brain cancer; Brain tissue; Glioma; Glioma cells; In-vitro models; Invasiveness; Tissue making; Tumor resection; Article; artificial intelligence; bioprinting; brain tissue; cancer model; cancer resistance; carcinogenesis; cell invasion; glioma; glioma cell; human; light induced bioprinting; machine learning; nonhuman; nozzle based bioprinting; regenerative medicine; three dimensional bioprinting; tissue engineering; tumor microenvironment; tumor vascularization; Tumors","","","","","Bilim Kahramanlari Dernegi; Royal Academy; Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung, AvH, (101003361); Bilim Akademisi","S T acknowledges Tubitak 2232 International Fellowship for Outstanding Researchers Award (118C391), Alexander von Humboldt Research Fellowship for Experienced Researchers, Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship (101003361), and Royal Academy Newton-Katip Çelebi Transforming Systems Through Partnership award for financial support of this research.

Rd, Taipei, 106344, Taiwan","Cellular structures of metallic alloys are often made for various industrial applications by additive manufacturing. The permeability for fluid flow in these cellular structures is important. The current investigated the gas fluidity of cellular structures made by selective laser melting (SLM). The porosity and permeability of the SLM cellular structures were measured for 17-4 PH stainless steel, Inconel 718, and Ti-6Al-4V alloys. The relations between porosity and energy density are expressed using the power law. The characteristic molar energies were 1.07 × 105, 9.02 × 104, and 7.11 × 104 J/mole for 17-4 PH steel, Ti-6Al-4V, and Inconel 718 alloys, respectively. 17-4 PH steel gave rise to higher porosity at the same energy density when compared with Ti-6Al-4V and Inconel 718 alloy. The values of these molar energy density are related to the heat needed to melt the alloys, viscosity, and thermal conductivity. It was further shown that air permeability is not only concerned with the percentage of porosity in the cellular materials, but it also relates to the tortuosity of pore pathways formed in the cellular materials. At the same porosity, Inconel 718 demonstrates higher air permeability in comparison with that of Ti-6Al-4V and 17-4 PH alloys due to its smoother pore pathways. Ti-6Al-4V, on the other hand, demonstrates the highest specific surface areas due to powder sticking along the pore pathways and led to the lowest permeability among the three alloys. © 2022 by the authors.","17-4 PH; cellular structures; energy density; Inconel 718; permeability; powder bed fusion; selective laser melting; Ti-6Al-4V","","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (108-2221-E-027-058-MY2); Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST","The financial support of the Ministry of Science and Technology, TAIWAN under grant MOST #108-2221-E-027-058-MY2 is acknowledged.

Bourgogne Franche-Comté, UTBM, Belfort, France","4D printing is considered as a disruptive manufacturing technology for creating innovative devices able to evolve in their usage environment. By coupling additive manufacturing (AM) processes and active/passive materials under the effect of an energy stimulation, objects can change properties, shapes, or even functionalities. To achieve a desired shape-change, recent advances in computational design around digital materials require tackling multi-material 4D printing. However, the deposition of active and passive materials in a single run remains difficult due to the different AM techniques required. To overcome this limitation in the context of complex materials distributions, an original approach is to address multi-material 4D printing from the perspective of interlocking blocks assembly. Therefore, the objective of the paper is to propose a computational design approach that converts a multi-material 4D object with a computed digital materials distribution into suitable interlocking blocks. The latter can be printed separately using single material AM and then assembled to achieve the targeted shape change. An implementation of the approach via a dedicated plugin within a computer-aided design environment is presented. A case study is introduced to illustrate the relevance and the applicability of the proposed approach. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","4D printing; Computational design; Design for 4D printing; Interlocking blocks; Smart materials; Voxel-based modeling","Manufacture; 4d printing; Computational design; Design approaches; Design for 4d printing; Interlocking block; Interlockings; Multi materials; Passive materials; Shape change; Voxel based modeling; Computer aided design","","","","","EIPHI, (ANR-17-EURE-0002); S.mart academic society and Bourgogne Franche-Comte","Funding text 1: Funding provided by the French ‘Investissements d′Avenir’ program, the EIPHI Graduate School (contract ANR-17-EURE-0002 ). ; Funding text 2: The authors would like to thank the reviewers for their feedback and comments.

This novel electrode fabrication technology exhibits the features of low-cost, no template requirement, customizable freedom design and controllable hierarchically micro-nanoporous architecture characteristics. The studies show that unique 3D geometry structure design will facilitate the enhancement of the electrochemical active surface area, wetting properties and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis performance for PA-based lattice electrodes. The as-prepared superwetting thiourea dioxide (TDO) type PA-based body-centred cubic with circular struts (BCCCS) lattice (1.0 mm) electrode as water splitting anode drives 1000 mA/cm2 large-current-density at 1.55V (vs Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE)) potential, which is 280 mV lower than the potential of the commercial Ni foam-based anode. This result shows obvious energy-saving advantage in industrial water splitting application area. Notably, the PA-based BCCCS lattice (1.0 mm) anode can stably drive 1000 mA/cm2 current density for at least 10 h in alkali electrolyte and obtains up to 100% anode faraday efficiency.

Manual design is difficult, time-consuming, and leads to sub-optimal designs that fail to fully exploit the extended geometric freedom that additive manufacturing offers. By using topology optimization and incorporating all manufacturing steps (printing, milling, and assembly) into the optimization formulation, high-quality optimized and manufacturable designs can be obtained in an automated manner. With a special focus on overhang control, minimum feature size, and computational effort, the proposed methodology is demonstrated using a case study of an industrial motion stage, optimized for maximum eigenfrequencies. For this case study, an optimized design can be obtained in a single day, showing a substantial performance increase of around 15% as compared to a conventional design. The generated design is manufactured using laser powder-bed fusion in aluminum and experimentally validated within 1% of the simulated performance. This shows that the combination of additive manufacturing and topology optimization can enable significant gains in the high-tech industry. © 2022","Eigenfrequency; Experimental validation; High dynamic performance; Industrial application; Laser powder-bed fusion; Topology optimization","Additives; Powder metals; Shape optimization; Topology; Eigenfrequency; Experimental validations; High dynamic performance; High-precision motion; Laser powder-bed fusion; Laser powders; Motion stage; Optimized designs; Powder bed; Topology optimisation; 3D printers","","","","","Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO, (15388); Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","This work was supported by the NWO, Netherlands HTSM research programme with project number 15388 .

Some of the lattice structures were subjected to different heat treatments to compare different microstructures: a two-phase α+β microstructure inherited from the fabrication (as-built), a full β-metastable microstructure, and a β-metastable microstructure strengthened via nanoprecipitation of the ωiso phase. We demonstrate that the macroscopic mechanical behavior of one of the most popular stretching-dominated lattice structure, namely the octet-truss, can be tailored through microstructural optimization by increasing the tolerance to plastic buckling of the constitutive struts.

Using a thermal steady-state system and varying contact pressures (0, 50, 75, and 100 bars), we present experimental results of the thermal contact resistance at the contact interface between steel A (1.2344), obtained from an extruded rod, and steel B (1.2709), produced by laser powder bed fusion. Thermal tests were performed for unbonded and bonded configurations. Results showed that increasing the contact pressure allows the system equilibrium to be reached at lower temperatures. Furthermore, thermal tests showed that in the transition zone of the bonded configuration, a well-defined resistance is not formed between the two steel samples as it occurs in the unbonded configuration. For the unbonded configuration, the thermal contact resistance values decrease with increasing applied contact pressure, improving the system’s heat transfer. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; mold thermal management; thermal contact resistance","","","","","","European Community Fund FEDER; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (UIDB/04077/2020, UIDB/04436/2020)","Funding text 1: Andrews Souza acknowledges PhD scholarship 2021.07961.BD provided by FCT. ; Funding text 2: This work was financially supported by project PRIDOP (POCI-01-0247-FEDER-040271), co-financed by the European Community Fund FEDER through POCI—Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionalização.

The use of copper materials for such applications requires both high material strength and high stability at high temperatures, which can be achieved by the concept of oxide dispersion strengthening. In the present work, we demonstrate the oxide reinforcement of two highly conductive precipitation-strengthened Cu-Cr-Nb alloys using laser additive manufacturing. Gas-atomized Cu-3.3Cr-0.5Nb and Cu-3.3Cr-1.5Nb (wt.%) powder materials are decorated with Y2O3 nanoparticles by mechanical alloying in a planetary mill and followed by consolidation by the laser additive manufacturing process of laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF). While dense specimens (>99.5%) of reinforced and nonreinforced alloys can be manufactured, oxide dispersion-strengthened alloys additionally exhibit homogeneously distributed oxide nanoparticles enriched in yttrium and chromium next to Cr2Nb precipitates present in all alloys examined. Higher niobium contents result in moderate increase of the Vickers hardness of approx. 10 HV0.3, while the homogeneously dispersed nanometer-sized oxide particles lead to a pronounced increase of approx. 30 HV0.3 in material strength compared to their nonreinforced counterparts. © 2022 by the authors.","copper–chromium–niobium; laser additive manufacturing; laser powder bed fusion; ODS; oxide dispersion strengthening","","","","","","","","Blakey-Milner B., Gradl P., Snedden G., Brooks M., Pitot J., Lopez E., Leary M., Berto F., du Plessis A., Metal additive manufacturing in aerospace: A review, Mater.

The fabrication of unsupported horizontal struts by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is inherently challenging, where the associated research data is limited for solid or dense cross-sections while no data exists for hollow struts. By examining LPBF-fabricated Ti-6Al-4V hollow struts of various diameters and wall thicknesses over increasing span lengths, a robust LPBF additive manufacturability range has been established for Ti-6Al-4V hollow struts. To achieve successful fabrication, three laser scan strategies were explored, proposed, and systematically compared. Horizontal solid struts and vertical hollow struts of equivalent diameters (and wall thickness) were similarly assessed over the same span lengths as comparators to quantify the manufacturability. This research provides previously unavailable design data, required for LPBF additive manufacturing of lattices with horizontal strut elements. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Hollow struts; Laser powder bed fusion; Lattices; Scan path; Ti-6Al-4V","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Industrial research; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Hollow strut; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Lattice; Manufacturability; Powder bed; Scan path; Span length; Ti-6al-4v; Wall thickness; Struts","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP200102666); Australian Research Council, ARC; RMIT University, RMIT","Funding text 1: This project was funded by the Australian Research Council (ARC) through DP200102666.

However, conventional poly(dimethylsiloxane) microchips are susceptible to adsorption by hydrophobic molecules on channel surfaces and permeation in the matrix. These can significantly compromise the drug availability and accuracy of dose-dependent quantitative analyses. Here, we prepared a perfluorinated polyether (PFPE) microchip via digital light processing 3D printing as a quantitative drug screening platform for precise concentration-dependent pharmaceutical assays. Cells cultured on PFPE microchips exhibited excellent viability with a spread morphology as well as superior proliferative capability. Importantly, PFPE constructions with a low surface energy significantly prevented the nonspecific molecular adsorption into their surfaces or permeation into the matrix. In particular, the PFPE multibranched channel preserved the concentration of the pharmaceutical drug during the perfusion process and generated a linear concentration gradient, resulting in a dose-dependent chemotherapeutic effect. We suggest that the biocompatible and nonadsorbing PFPE microchannel can provide a cell-based drug screening platform for concentration-dependent quantitative analyses. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

CNFs were shear stir blended at various weight ratios with liquid resin. The fabricated nanocomposite materials were introduced in an SLA 3D printer for specimens manufacturing. The mechanical performance was studied according to international standards. Charpy Toughness and Vickers microhardness were calculated for all tested materials. A microscopic and surface analysis was conducted on fractured tensile specimens by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), respectively. The thermal and thermomechanical properties were investigated by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Differential Calorimetry (DSC), and Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA). Significant reinforcement of the medical-grade nanocomposites is reported, with the highest values calculated to be at 1.0 wt% concentration (more than 100% at the tensile strength), while brittleness and rigidity were increased. © 2022 The Authors","3D printing; Biomedical resin; Cellulose nanofibers (CNFs); Fractography; Mechanical testing; Vat photopolymerization","Gravimetry; Performance; Photopolymerization; Reinforcement; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Tensile Strength; Thermal Analysis; Fractography; Fracture mechanics; Mechanical testing; Nanocellulose; Nanocomposites; Nanofibers; Reinforcement; Resins; Scanning electron microscopy; Surface analysis; Tensile strength; Thermogravimetric analysis; cellulose nanofiber; resin; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Additive manufacturing technology; Biomedical resin; Cellulose nanofiber; Cellulose nanofibers; Medical grades; Performance; Photo polymerization; Vat photopolymerization; Article; atomic force microscopy; calorimetry; chemical analysis; controlled study; flexural strength; manufacturing; mechanical test; Raman spectrometry; scanning electron microscopy; stereolithography; surface analysis; thermal analysis; three dimensional printing; Vickers microhardness; Photopolymerization","","","","","Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser of the Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas; Photonic Phononic and Meta-Materials Laboratory","The authors would like to thank the Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser of the Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (IESL-FORTH) and in particular Ms. Aleka Manousaki for taking the SEM images presented in this work, and the Photonic Phononic and Meta-Materials Laboratory for sharing the Raman Instrumentation.","Ambrosio D., Gabrion X., Malecot P., Amiot F., Thibaud S., Influence of manufacturing parameters on the mechanical properties of projection stereolithography–manufactured specimens, Int.

In this paper, the effect of a non-conventional HIP-cycle on the fatigue behavior of a Ti-6Al-4V alloy manufactured by Selective Laser melting (SLM) is studied. The HIP-cycle examined in this study is carried out at pressure of 200 MPa and a temperature of 850 °C for 2 h. Moreover, the cooling process is faster than that obtained from conventional furnace cooling rates, with the aim to limit the microstructural coarsening effects that affect the fatigue behavior. For the study, an extensive experimental fatigue program was carried out which included a first batch of SLM specimens tested under as-built conditions, a second batch of SLM specimens subjected to the present HIP process, and a third batch of specimens of a reference wrought processed material obtained by rolling and annealing processes. The microstructure of the material, before and after HIPping, is analyzed and a fractographic analysis is carried out to study the mechanism of crack initiation and its relation to the fatigue behavior. The results show that the present HIP-process allows for very good material densification, a microstructure that shows minimal coarsening effects, and good fatigue properties comparable to the conventional wrought processed material. © 2022 The Author(s)","Fatigue behavior;

Brass alloys as an additive were found to be noteworthy composites used in additive manufacturing. Till date, limited research data are available on the tensile properties of PLA–brass composites manufactured using the FDM process. As such, the present research investigates the tensile properties of brass–PLA composite at various infill patterns and compositions (15% and 70%). The significant parameter affecting the mechanical parameters was determined using response surface methodology (RSM). Mechanical qualities were mathematically modeled using the response surface methodology, anticipating the needed output value for various compositions, and infill patterns. In conclusion, for the tensile test, the concentric pattern achieves the highest value for elastic modulus, ultimate tensile strength, and yield strength (0.2% offset) for both compositions and the octa-spiral pattern has the weakest properties. The highest value of elastic modulus, ultimate tensile strength, and yield strength (0.2% offset) obtained was 0.333 GPa, 7.758 MPa and 4.539 MPa, respectively. The higher infill composition was found to decreases the tensile behavior of the composite.

Low energy densification of AM ceramic green bodies is highly desirable, and the cold sintering process (CSP) is a promising candidate, illustrated here by an in situ study of CSP for a model system, potassium di-phosphate (KDP). In order for ceramic additive manufacturing (AM) to achieve its full potential, it is increasingly important to develop a more rigorous understanding of fundamental phenomena that govern the kinetics and thermodynamics of ceramic AM processes. In the case of additive build processes, such as direct ink write and ceramic extrusion, methods for densifying the resulting green-body product need to be considered to complement the efficiencies of ceramics AM, itself. One densification route, at least for monolithic components, built layer-by-layer, is offered by the recently developed cold sintering process, whereby high-density final product is achieved through addition of a small amount of liquid solvent and application of modest uniaxial compressive stress at relatively low temperature. In situ small-angle X-ray scattering methods and X-ray diffraction have been applied to characterize and quantify the pore morphology evolution during cold sintering for a model system: potassium di-phosphate, KH2PO4 (KDP). It is shown that both temperature and applied stress affect the densification rate, but stress has a stronger effect on the evolving morphology. A regime with an approximate linear densification rate can be identified, yielding an effective densification activation energy of ≈90 kJ/mol. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; ceramic densification; cold sintering process; materials and process characterization tools; microstructure characterization; X-ray scattering","","","","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; Argonne National Laboratory, ANL, (DE-AC02-06CH11357)","This research used resources of the Advanced Photon Source, a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science user facility operated for the DOE Office of Science by Argonne National Laboratory under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357.","Zhang C., Chen F., Huang Z., Jia M., Chen G., Ye Y., Lin Y., Liu W., Chen B., Shen Q., Et al., Additive manufacturing of functionally graded materials: A review, Mater.

In this study, the relationship between the hierarchical microstructure and mechanical properties along the horizontal, diagonal, and vertical directions of the LPBF-built CoCrFeMnNi high entropy alloy (HEA) were qualitatively and quantitatively investigated. The horizontal samples exhibit the highest yield strength (YS) and the lowest elongation, while the vertical samples show the lowest YS and a slightly lower elongation than the diagonal samples, which are nearly two times the horizontal samples. Among the microstructural features at multiple length scales, both the columnar grain morphology and texture determine the anisotropy of mechanical properties. For the first time, the volume-weighted (V–W) average grain size was used to estimate the YS and critical twinning stress (CTS) of the LPBF-built CoCrFeMnNi alloy with a complex grain size distribution. The V–W average grain size exhibited high accuracy in calculating the YSs of the diagonal and vertical samples as well as CTSs along all the three directions. For the horizontal sample, the grain morphology dominates over texture during deformation, which is the same for the diagonal and vertical samples at the early stage of deformation. The texture plays a more important role at the late stage of straining. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Deformation twinning; High entropy alloy; Laser powder bed fusion; Mechanical property; Microstructural heterogeneity","Anisotropy; Chromium alloys; Deformation; Entropy; Grain size and shape; High-entropy alloys; Iron alloys; Manganese alloys; Morphology; Textures; Twinning; Anisotropy of mechanical properties; Average grain size; Deformation twinning; Grain morphologies; High entropy alloys; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Microstructural heterogeneity; Powder bed; Volume-weighted averages; Cobalt alloys","","","","","Shanghai Sailing Program, (17YF1408700); Yi Mao and Xuanfeng Shan in Shanghai Hanbang United 3D Tech Co.

Complex geometries for dielectrics and conductors can now be simulated and rapidly fabricated from digital data. Powder bed fusion of metals is arguably the most widely adopted additive process by industry and can provide intricately-detailed structures in a wide range of high performance alloys. Copper and copper alloys have remained a challenge in this additive process, as the typical laser wavelength (approximately 1070 nm) used fails to provide sufficient absorption. Moreover, the high thermal conductivity of copper does not allow for the required heat generation for a stable melt pool. However, the recent commercial introduction of the green laser (515 nm wavelength) is enabling the printing of copper, which is particularly interesting for electrical and electromagnetic applications due to the high electrical conductivity and solderability. This paper describes the use of a green laser powder bed fusion system used to fabricate a complex fractal Sierpinski gasket ground structure with an isolated internal pyramid antenna built simultaneously—within and dielectrically isolated from the external ground element: a ship-in-the-bottle design paradigm. The electromagnetic performance, surface finish, dimensional compliance, and conductivity were measured and reported to inform the design of freestanding, geometrically-complex antennas. © 2022, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; Copper; Fractal antennas; Green laser; Powder bed fusion; Sierpinski gasket","","","","","","Ohio Federal Research Network, OFRN","","Kokkinis D., Schaffner M., Studart A.R., Multimaterial magnetically assisted 3D printing of composite materials, Nat Commun, 6, (2015); El-Wardany T.I., She Y., Jagdale V.N., Garofano J.K., Liou J.J., Schmidt W.R., Challenges in three-dimensional printing of high-conductivity copper, J Electron Packag, (2018); Smith P.J., Shin D.-Y., Stringer J.E., Derby B., Reis N., Direct ink-jet printing and low temperature conversion of conductive silver patterns, J Mater Sci, 41, pp. 4153-4158, (2006); Adams J.J., Duoss E.B., Malkowski T.F., Motala M.J., Ahn B.Y., Nuzzo R.G., Et al., Conformal printing of electrically small antennas on three-dimensional surfaces, Adv Mater, 23, pp. 1335-1340, (2011); Ahn B.Y., Walker S.B., Slimmer S.C., Russo A., Gupta A., Kranz S., Et al., Planar and three-dimensional printing of conductive inks, J Vis Exp, (2011); Paulsen J.A., Renn M., Christenson K., Plourde R., Printing conformal electronics on 3D structures with Aerosol Jet technology, 2012 Future of Instrumentation International Workshop (FIIW) Proceedings, pp. 1-4, (2012); Ahmadloo M., Mousavi P., A novel integrated dielectric-and-conductive ink 3D printing technique for fabrication of microwave devices, 2013 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest (MTT), pp. 1-3, (2013); Nate K.A., Hester J., Isakov M., Bahr R., Tentzeris M.M., A fully printed multilayer aperture-coupled patch antenna using hybrid 3D/inkjet additive manufacturing technique. 2015 European microwave conference (EuMC). ieeexplore.ieee.org; pp, 610–613, (2015); Nassar I.T., Weller T.M., Tsang H., A 3-D Printed Miniaturized Log-Periodic Dipole Antenna. 2014 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium (APSURSI).

In this study, structural and morphological properties of insect powder-based bio-inks with 0%–75% insect powder (IP) in wheat flour (WF) matrix were evaluated. Proximate composition, water absorption capacity, amino acids and degree of redness and yellowness increased (P < 0.05). Fourier transform infrared analysis, scanning electron microscope and 3D printability results showed good incorporation of IP and WF. Good viscoelastic properties were exhibited by the inks using 40% solid of 75% IP and 25% WF, and 50% solid of 50% IP and 50% WF. These samples showed comparable dimensions to the standard design and had good textural properties. Thus, 3DP can be effective in processing edible insects, improving the aesthetic quality and reducing consumer apathy. © 2022 Institute of Food Science and Technology.","Acheta domesticus; bio-ink; edible insect; printability; three-dimensional printing; viscoelasticity; wheat flour","3D printers; Food processing; Scanning electron microscopy; Water absorption; Acheta domestici; Aesthetic qualities; Bio-ink; Edible insect; Novel foods; Powder blends; Printability; Three-dimensional printing (3DP); Three-dimensional-printing; Wheat flours; Viscoelasticity","","","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2021‐0‐01568); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, MAFRA, (321028‐5); Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, MAFRA; Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, iPET; Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion, IITP; Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea, MSIT","Funding text 1: This work was supported by Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2021-0-01568, AI-based Smart Manufacturing Platform for biomaterial and sensor development) and also supported by the Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture and Forestry (IPET) through the High Value-added Food Technology Development Program, funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA) (Grant No. 321028-5).; Funding text 2: This work was supported by Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2021‐0‐01568, AI‐based Smart Manufacturing Platform for biomaterial and sensor development) and also supported by the Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture and Forestry (IPET) through the High Value‐added Food Technology Development Program, funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA) (Grant No. 321028‐5).

Quality control and mechanical characterization remain the most expensive challenge. The quality and mechanical properties of the manufactured parts are influenced by potential defects; the characteristics of these defects, such as size, shape, location, and distribution, have shown to play key roles in mechanical properties. This work proposes a methodology for providing the identification of powder bed anomalies and consequent part defects through a synchronized analysis of the powder layers via digital image processing. This method can be used to study the critical defects formation during the layerwise process, providing important information about their location without the use of expensive or destructive measurements. © 2022, The Author(s).","Defect detection;

In this paper, a double-layer pyramidal lattice truss sandwich cylinder was designed and printed by selective laser melting (SLM) method, which has advantages in integrally manufacturing end frames and bolt holes. With diameter of 0.493 m, this cylinder is one of the lattice truss sandwich structures with the largest diameter at present. Free vibration testing was carried out to reveal the free vibration responses of the cylinder. The first-order vibration turns from a circle to an oval in the plane of the cross section. The fundamental frequency is 133.9 Hz. An equivalent shell free vibration theory was proposed and finite element models (FEMs) based on discrete model and equivalent shell model were applied to predict the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the cylinder. Advantages of the AM method in making light and stiff large-sized aerospace structures are confirmed through this research.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Additive manufacture; free vibration; lattice truss sandwich cylinder","Additives; Cylinders (shapes); Natural frequencies; Structural design; Trusses; Additive manufacture; Double layers; Free vibration; Free vibration behavior; Lattice truss sandwich cylinder; Lightweight design; Loadbearing structure; Primary loads; Sandwich cylinders; Selective laser melting; 3D printers","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11972184, U20A20286); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (BK20200412, BK20201286); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","Support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (11972184 and U20A20286) and the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China (BK20201286 and BK20200412) is gratefully acknowledged.","Lai C.

This occurs over a range of scan line length that is well below the maximum scan line length recommended by the electron-beam powder bed fusion machine manufacturer. The microstructural attributes such as α lath thickness, prior β grain size, and β phase fraction were similar for materials fabricated under short and long scan line length conditions, but the crystallographic textures varied considerably. Electron backscatter diffraction measurements indicate the basal pole [0001]α was strongly aligned with the build direction for long scan line length conditions, whereas 112‾0α were aligned with the build direction for short scan line length conditions. Subsequent prior β reconstructions indicate a preference for alignment of 110β and 100β with build direction for long and short scan line length conditions, respectively. Both yield and ultimate tensile strengths along the build direction were approximately 8% higher for long scan line lengths, consistent with the observed differences in texture. The impact of a sub-solvus hot isostatic pressing was also investigated, however, this did not significantly change the textures of as-built materials or the relative strengths for the two processing conditions. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD); Preferred orientation; Scan line length; Titanium alloy","Backscattering; Electron beam melting; Electron beams; Electron diffraction; Electrons; Hot isostatic pressing; Tensile strength; Textures; Titanium alloys; Build direction; Condition; Electron back scatter diffraction; Electron backscatter diffraction; Electron-beam; Preferred orientations; Scan line; Scan line length; Titanium (alloys); 3D printers","","","","","Jared Shank; UES, Inc.; Hispanics in Philanthropy, HIP","The authors thank Jared Shank (UES, Inc.) and Nathan Levkulich (UES, Inc.) for help with EBSD data acquisition, Dr. Dennis J.

Negative Poisson's ratio is achieved through the careful design of the structures. Generally, auxetic structures are not feasible to manufacture using the conventional manufacturing processes due to the unit cell's complex geometry, additive manufacturing help in alleviating this issue. Material extrusion/Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is the most simple, reliable, and low-cost additive manufacturing process in use. The mechanical performance of FFF processed auxetics is influenced by both geometrical parameters of auxetics and printing parameters. The careful selection of these parameters is of prime priority to avoid premature failure of printed structures. In the present work, the re-entrant diamond auxetic mechanical metamaterial is fabricated via FFF using the most commonly used FFF feedstock material, Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS). Initially, efforts are made to fine-tune the FFF process parameters to process these complicated geometrical structures. The ideal deformation parametric zone is defined with preliminary experiments to avoid premature failure of the re-entrant diamond structure. Experimental investigation of the effect of auxetic geometrical parameters and FFF process parameters on the quasi-static in-plane compressive performance is systematically evaluated using the design of experiments. The grey-based optimisation method is considered to optimise influential parameters for combined responses. Further, the re-entrant diamond auxetic metamaterial is reinforced with short carbon and glass fibre, and studied at optimal parametric levels. Reinforcements have enhanced the specific strength and stiffness of the structure with the loss of energy absorption characteristics. Microscopic studies confirm the predominant failure modes as a bond failure for CF-ABS and fibre breakage for GF-ABS. This study also aims to serve as fabrication guidelines to process complicated cellular composite structures via FFF. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Auxetics; FFF; Fibre-reinforcement; Mechanical metamaterials; Multi-objective optimisation; Parametric analysis","3D printers; Additives; Design of experiments; Extrusion; Fibers; Geometry; Metamaterials; Multiobjective optimization; Poisson ratio; Reinforcement; Styrene; Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene; Auxetics; Fiber reinforcement (e); Fused filament fabrication; Mechanical; Mechanical metamaterial; Multi-objectives optimization; Negative Poisson ratio; Parametric analysis; Premature failures; Fabrication","","","","","FIST; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी","The authors are grateful to Dr Piyush Shakya and Mr Sitesh Kumar Mishra of IIT Madras for helping in capturing digital microscopic images.

The results show that the microstructure of Inconel 625 alloy prepared by SLM process is composed of obvious columnar and cellular grains. Inconel 625 fabricated by LENS also has columnar and cellular structures, but the grain size is relatively large. Significant anisotropy of mechanical properties is observed in SLM and LENS printed Inconel 625. The mechanical properties in XY direction are higher than those in XZ direction, and the maximum tensile strength of SLM-XY sample is 1241.5 MPa. SLM printed Inconel 625 has a relatively higher dislocation density of 2.8 ± 1.2 × 1014 m−2. The difference in yield strength between SLM and LENS printed Inconel 625 is mainly caused by the different dislocation strengthening effects. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Anisotropy; Inconel 625; Laser engineered net shaping; Selective laser melting; Tensile properties","Melting; Microstructure; Selective laser melting; Tensile strength; Cellular structure; Cellulars; Columnar structures; Inconel 625; Inconel 625 alloys; Laser engineered net shaping; Laser melting process; Mechanical behavior; Selective laser melting; Shaping technologies; Anisotropy","","","","","Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research, (2021B0301030001); International Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship Program, (20190059); National Key Laboratory Foundation of Science and Technology on Materials, (6142902210109); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51521001, 51972246); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFB0905600); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (B13035); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Science and Technology Planning Project of Shenzhen Municipality, (JCYJ20190809153405505); Science and Technology Planning Project of Shenzhen Municipality","This work is supported by the Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research ( 2021B0301030001 ), National Key Laboratory Foundation of Science and Technology on Materials under Shock and Impact ( 6142902210109 ), Shenzhen Science and Technology Project ( JCYJ20190809153405505 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51972246 , and 51521001 ), the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2018YFB0905600 ), Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities in China, the “111″ project (No. B13035 ), and the International Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship Program ( 20190059 ).","Shankar V., Bhanu Sankara Rao K., Mannan S.L., Microstructure and mechanical properties of Inconel 625 superalloy, J.

Despite Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) being the most popular process, it still suffers from certain limitations, such as production time and material required to build the material support structure for overhang parts. This results in increased total build time and material requirement. This article aims to eliminate these limitations by using a proposed hybrid reconfigurable pin FDM system. A hybrid system is proposed to eliminate the problem of support build time and material requirements. The proposed hybrid FDM is the combination of traditional FDM with a reconfigurable pins platform. The proposed hybrid system has been implemented for printing an overhang test part. The result analysis also reveals that the proposed hybrid system is an effective way of producing overhang parts without material support structures. A real-life case example is considered for validation of the proposed reconfigurable pins platform. © IMechE 2022.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; build time; fused deposition modeling","Additives;

A design of experiments (DOE) approach was undertaken to explore the impact of CNF weight fraction, extrusion temperature, and number of extrusions on sensor performance. The initial extrusion combined pulverized PLA material and CNFs via a dry melt-mixing process. Through the DOE process, it was found that extruding CNF/PLA material at 185 °C for two total extrusions yielded material with dramatic improvements in electrical properties compared to unmodified material. Using the optimal manufacturing procedure, piezoresistive dog-bone shaped sensors were manufactured via FFF with 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 wt % CNF/PLA filament and three different sizes. Piezoresistive testing under monotonic and cyclic loading conditions revealed strong and repeatable behavior from the piezoresistive AM sensors produced with 7.5 and 10.0 wt % CNFs. In general, 7.5 wt % CNF/PLA sensors showed greater strain sensitivity than 10.0 wt % CNF/PLA sensors for monotonic loading. Additionally, sensor size appeared to contribute significantly to the performance of 7.5 wt % CNF/PLA sensors. However, the 10.0 wt % CNF/PLA sensors exhibited greater repeatability in their piezoresistive response, and sensor size had much less impact on strain sensing performance. The printed sensors also exhibited a strong response under cyclic loading, however, variability in their piezoresistive response was significantly higher than under monotonic loading conditions. The results of this study are an important step towards the realization of low-cost, easily produced, and highly customizable strain sensors produced via FFF technology. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D printed sensors; Additive manufacturing (AM); Conductive polymers; Fused Filament Fabrication; Multifunctional materials; Nanocomposites; Piezoresistivity","Additives; Carbon nanofibers; Cyclic loads; Design of experiments; Extrusion; Fabrication; Nanocomposites; 3d printed sensor; Additive manufacturing; Carbon nanofibres; Conductive Polymer; Fused filament fabrication; Multi-functional materials; Piezo-resistive; Piezoresistivity; Printed sensors; Strain sensors; 3D printers","","","","","Purdue Polytechnic Graduate Assistance; Purdue University, PU; Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC, (NSWC IHEODTD BAA N00174‐18‐0001N00174–18-0001); Naval Surface Warfare Center, NSWC","Funding text 1: This research is supported by the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Carderock Division (grant number NSWC IHEODTD BAA N00174‐18‐0001N00174–18-0001 ) and the Purdue Polytechnic Graduate Assistance .

Since the support structures are not a part of the final component, extra time and material are needed for manufacturing. Moreover, they need to be removed after the build is completed. In addition to waste of time and material, distortion and/or surface roughness issues at supported surfaces may be observed during support removal. As a solution, contactless supports with no direct contact between the support and the part are studied in the present work. Contactless support gap, thickness of each contactless support pieces, and the spacing between two contactless support pieces were used as design variables, and dimensional variations, microhardness through thickness, microstructural changes of bottom surfaces, and surface roughness of overhang features were selected as performance outputs. A full set of design of experiments were manufactured by laser powder bed fusion process using Inconel 718 material. It was observed that all three geometrical parameters had influence on the performance outputs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Contactless support; Dimensional variation; Laser powder bed fusion; Microhardness; Surface roughness","Design of experiments; Geometry; Ground supports; Powder metals; Surface roughness; Contact less; Contactless support; Dimensional variations; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Metal additives; Performance; Powder bed; Support parameters; Support structures; Microhardness","","","","","Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu, TÜBİTAK, (5158001); Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu, TÜBİTAK","This study was carried out under the Scientific and Technological Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) Technology and Innovation Support Program (Grant number: 5158001).

The approach incorporates the evolution of dislocations, forming a forest, and of twins, which develop a back-stress. The overall plasticity behaviour is described in terms of dislocation multiplication and annihilation progress with strain. The modelling is matched up with detailed electron microscopy observations; the combination of both demonstrates the deformation behaviour of LPBF builds is intrinsically different to that of wrought alloys. LPBFed samples undergo three stages of deformation, with the first developing twins, which formation quickly saturates; the second sees a dramatic increase in dislocation forest hardening, combined with dislocation recovery; and the third undergoes dynamic recrystallisation taking place around heavily twinned sections. Opposite to wrought alloys, LPBFed specimens decrease their density of statistically stored dislocations throughout deformation, and it is shown that this behaviour is replicated by other LPBFed metals, including high-entropy alloys. The intrinsic behavioural differences in LPBF plasticity is thought to be due to the presence of a residual stress; this promotes dislocation recovery from the onset of deformation. © 2022 The Author(s)","316L stainless steel; Additive manufacturing; Laser powder bed fusion; Residual stress; Strain hardening; Twinning-induced plasticity","3D printers; Austenitic stainless steel; Deformation; Forestry; Powder metals; Residual stresses; 316 L stainless steel; Back stress; Deformation mechanism; Dislocation recovery; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Modeling approach; Powder bed; Twinning-induced plasticities; Wrought alloys; Strain hardening","","","","","United Kingdom; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/L025213/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; Royal Academy of Engineering, RAENG, (RCSRF1718/5/32); Royal Academy of Engineering, RAENG; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51971011); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (Incentivo/SAU/LA0001/2013); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT","This work was supported by the Royal Academy of Engineering, United Kingdom ( RCSRF1718/5/32 ), and by EPSRC, United Kingdom via DARE grant ( EP/L025213/1 ).

However, quality assurance is the main challenge in AM industry due to the possible time-varying processing conditions during AM process. Notably, new defects may occur during printing, which cannot be mitigated by offline analysis tools that focus on existing defects. This challenge motivates this work to develop online learning-based methods to deal with the new defects during printing. Since AM typically fabricates a small number of customized products, this paper aims to create an online learning-based strategy to mitigate the new defects in AM process while minimizing the number of samples needed. The proposed method is based on model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL). It is called Continual G-learning since it transfers several sources of prior knowledge to reduce the needed training samples in the AM process. Offline knowledge is obtained from literature, while online knowledge is learned during printing. The proposed method develops a new algorithm for learning the optimal defect mitigation strategies proven the best performance when utilizing both knowledge sources. Numerical and real-world case studies in a fused filament fabrication (FFF) platform are performed and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Additive Manufacturing (AM); Defect Mitigation; Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF); G-Learning; Knowledge Transfer; Model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL)","Additives; Defects; E-learning; Fabrication; Knowledge management; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Numerical methods; Quality assurance; Reinforcement learning; Additive manufacturing; Additive manufacturing process; Defect mitigations; Fused filament fabrication; G-learning; Knowledge transfer; Model free; Model-free reinforcement learning; Online learning; Reinforcement learnings; 3D printers","","","","","U.S. Department of Defense, DOD, (N00014-19-1-2728); U.S. Department of Defense, DOD","Research reported in this publication was supported by the Department of Defense under award N00014-19-1-2728 .

Selective laser melting (SLM) on a powder bed is a potential process for manufacturing such as dental tools. Microstructural studies are conducted on NiTi-SLM using a parallel strip strategy and 90° laser beam rotation. The multi-scale (nano-, micro- and mesoscopic) microstructure is revealed. Similar “cast” type microstructure features are found. The SLM melt is casted in a “micro-mold”. Fine micro-grains with random crystallographic orientation are formed near the mold walls and served as seats for the rapid growth of columnar dendritic grains along the 〈0 0 1〉 direction with epitaxial crystallographic relationships. The growth of the columnar grains curves towards the center of the “micro-mold”, coinciding with the center of the laser beam.

A procedure of AM applicability to preventive maintenance is presented. To this end, the results of the application of a case that has been carried out in the Stellantis factory located in the Vigo (Spain) area have been obtained. The procedure was based on an initial inventory from which a series of lists have been obtained that were later categorised. This was performed in order to know the technical and economic applicability of polymeric spare parts replacement by parts made of AM in polyamide material (PA12) through two manufacturing methods (HP Multi-Jet and Selective Laser Sintering technology, SLS). Original spare parts were characterised and compared with replacement parts made in AM.

We studied the effects of exposure energy, defocus distance, and a diameter adjustment algorithm to ensure printed MLAs with designed dimensions. Experiment results demonstrate that our simple fabrication method is applicable to the manufacture of various MLA designs, while achieving nanoscale surface roughness and good image quality. We determined that the height of the MLAs is proportional to the exposure energy. The highest height-to-diameter ratio achieved in this study was 0.63 (diameter = 200 µm; height = 126 µm). Our use of defocusing significantly reduced the average surface roughness (Ra) of the printed MLAs to 129 nm with a corresponding improvement in image resolution 45.3 lp/mm. Our use of a diameter adjustment algorithm in designing the digital mask helped preserve the dimensionality of the printed MLAs. The proposed manufacturing process was used to create a variety of MLAs with numerical apertures as high as 0.980, multiple focal lengths on a single substrate (from 21 µm to 199 µm), and fill factors as high as 77.98 %. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive Manufacturing; Microfabrication; Microlens array (MLA); Microstructure; Stereolithography (SLA)","Image resolution; Microlenses; Microstructure; Optical instrument lenses; Stereolithography; Substrates; Surface roughness; Adjustment algorithms; Defocus; Defocus distance; Defocusing; Digital light processing; Exposure energy; Micro-fabrication; Micro-lens arrays; Microlens array; Stereolithography; Image enhancement","","","","","Mechanical Engineering Department of National Taiwan University of Science and Technology; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (110-2628-E-011-006); National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, NTUST","This work was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST 110-2628-E-011-006 ) and the Mechanical Engineering Department of National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST).

Additive manufacturing technologies arise as an alternative for creating mould inserts at lower costs and shorter lead times. In this context, this study describes a series of stereolithography (SLA)-printed injection mould inserts fabricated from two photopolymer resins, utilised to mould standard tensile specimens of a commercial-grade polypropylene, aiming to evaluate effects on the polymer’s thermal and mechanical properties. Our results demonstrated that the glass fibre-filled resin inserts withstood more moulding cycles before failure, had superior mechanical properties, higher Tg and greater thermal conductivity. Calorimetric data revealed that PP thermal properties and degree of crystallinity were little affected, while mechanical testing suggests a significant effect in the elongation at break. Thus, these findings highlight the importance of adequate heat extraction during injection moulding and endorse further application of SLA mould inserts for the manufacturing of injection-moulded plastic parts in the case of prototypes or small batches, provided suitable cooling is made available, contributing to the feasibility and affordability of employing this approach for an industrial setting. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printed moulds; additive manufacturing; injection moulding; polypropylene; stereolithography","","","","","","European Regional Development Fund, ERDF; , (SFI 16/RC/3918, 16/RC/3918); Enterprise Ireland, (TG-2017-0114)","This publication has results from research conducted with the financial support of Enterprise Ireland under the Technology Gateway Programme, Grant Number TG-2017-0114 (APT Ireland), and Science Foundation Ireland (SFI), Grant Number SFI 16/RC/3918, cofunded by the European Regional Development Fund.

The current work attempts to establish the influence of these microstructures on the corrosion behavior of the SLM processed CuSn alloy. The as-built SLM samples showed heterogeneous epitaxial columnar grains, fine cellular dislocation structure (~ 600 nm) with cell boundaries having higher dislocation density and solute Sn concentration than the cell interior, super-saturated solid-solution with ~ 6.5 wt% of Sn in Cu, and fine second-phase δ (Cu41Sn11) ~ 200 nm. The SLM microstructures affected the corrosion behavior of the CuSn alloy: the as-built samples showed high corrosion rate than the post-SLM heat-treated fully recrystallized samples. The effects of the residual stresses, cellular segregation, and second-phase δ (Cu41Sn11) on the corrosion behavior are minimal. The dislocation density and distribution primarily control the corrosion behavior of the SLM processed CuSn alloy. The partially recrystallized microstructures with heterogeneous dislocation distribution showed an increased corrosion rate. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","","Binary alloys; Corrosion rate; Corrosive effects; Melting; Recrystallization (metallurgy); Tin; Tin alloys; Cellulars; Corrosion behaviour; Cu-Sn alloys; Fusion techniques; Heterogeneous microstructure; Laser powders; Powder bed; Second phase; Selective laser melting; Thermal history; Microstructure","","","","","Ministry of Science, and ICT, (2017H1D3A1A01013666, 2019H1D3A1A01102866, 2020H1D3A1A04105882); Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE, (20201510100030, 2021R1A2C3006662); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning, KETEP; Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea, MSIT","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT), the Korean Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP), and the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea (2021R1A2C3006662 and 20201510100030).

Translation of patient-specific devices requires time- and cost-effective processes to design, verify and validate in adherence to FDA guidance for medical device manufacture. In this study, we present a generalized strategy for selective laser sintering (SLS) of patient-specific medical devices following the prescribed guidance for additive manufacturing of medical devices issued by the FDA in 2018. We contextualize this process for manufacturing an Airway Support Device, a life-saving tracheal and bronchial implant restoring airway patency for pediatric patients diagnosed with tracheobronchomalacia and exhibiting partial or complete airway collapse. The process covers image-based modeling, design inputs, design verification, material inputs and verification, device verification, and device validation, including clinical results. We demonstrate how design and material assessment lead to verified Airway Support Devices that achieve desired airway patency and reduction in required Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) after patient implantation. We propose this process as a template for general quality control of patient-specific, 3D printed implants. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Good manufacturing practice; Tracheal reconstruction; Translational devices","Bronchi; Child; Humans; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Trachea; Additives; Computerized tomography; Cost effectiveness; Laser heating; Patient monitoring; Pediatrics; Sintering; Airway patencies; Biodegradable devices; Good Manufacturing Practices; Medical Devices; Patient specific; Personalized medicines; Quality of care; Support devices; Tracheal reconstruction; Translational device; Article; equipment design; finite element analysis; good manufacturing practice; human; particle size; pediatrics; positive end expiratory pressure ventilation; respiratory arrest; selective laser sintering; three dimensional printing; trachea reconstruction; tracheobronchomalacia; tracheostomy; bronchus; child; three dimensional printing; trachea; 3D printers","","","","","Children's Hospital of Atlanta Pediatric Trust Fund; Imlay Foundation; National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R01HD086201); National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R01 086201); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","This work was supported by the NIH / NICHD R01 086201 (SJH PI) .

Some of these effects cannot be corrected by post processing like heat treatment. This work aims at optimizing fused deposition modelling process parameters for the least residual stresses during 3D printing of carbon fiber reinforced nylon 12 hip implant. Taguchi design of experiment was used to study the effect of printing temperature, layer thickness and print speed on the residual stresses using the Digimat- additive manufacturing software. The results show that the optimal factor setting levels for minimizing part residual stresses were printing temperature of 255 °C, layer thickness of 0.3 mm, and a print speed of 50 mm/s. Printing temperature has the most significant influence on the residual stresses. The combination of the optimum parameter levels yielded the least simulation residual stresses of (41.75 (Formula presented.) 6.53) MPa while the experimental residual stress results were (40.7 (Formula presented.) 7.7) MPa. The simulated and experimental results agreed with minimal percentage difference of (2.51 (Formula presented.) 0.04) %. Tensile and compressive properties of 3D printed carbon fiber nylon 12 composite hip implant matched those of cortical bone. The fracture surface of failed tensile specimens revealed that failure occurred through fiber pull-out and matrix fracture. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","Carbon fiber nylon 12 composite; fused deposition modelling (FDM); hip joint implant; mechanical properties; residual stresses","Additives; Deposition; Design of experiments; Fused Deposition Modeling; Layered manufacturing; Polyamides; Rayon; Carbon fiber nylon 12 composite; Fused deposition modeling; Hip implants; Hip-joint implants; Layer thickness; Modeling process; Nylon-12; Print speed; Process parameters optimizations; Stress-induced; Residual stresses","","","","","","","Ning F., Cong W., Hu Y., Wang H., Procedia Manuf., 5, (2017); Bougherara H., Bureau M.N., Yahia L., J.

However, the SLM is often associated with fast cooling rate and a resultant large thermal gradient; which may lead to a large amount of plastic strains and coexistent residual stresses, and sometimes even result in cracking and failure during the fabrication. These plastic strains and residual stresses play crucial roles in determining the mechanical performance of the produced structural members. Plastic strains cannot be directly measured but can be characterized indirectly by hardness values. Thus, it is essential to study the distributions and magnitudes of both residual stresses and hardness in SLM-fabricated members. In the present study, comprehensive experimental studies on micro-hardness, material properties and residual stresses in SLM-fabricated H13 high strength steel hollow sections were conducted. Non-destructive neutron diffraction was utilized to measure residual stresses and their distributions across the wall thickness and over the cross-sections. The effects of both scanning patterns and cross-section geometries on the residual stresses and hardness were also studied. Linear relationships between the hardness values and the material strengths were established for the additively manufactured H13 steel. The Vickers hardness value was found to be highly correlated to the ultimate strength, while it was correlated to the 0.2% tensile proof stress with a small deviation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Hardness; High strength steel; Hollow sections; Mechanical properties; Residual stresses; Selective laser melting","Elasticity; High strength steel; Melting; Microhardness; Plastic deformation; Selective laser melting; Stress analysis; Structural design; Cooling rates; Hardness values; High-strength steels; Hollow section; Large amounts; Manufacturing techniques; Metal additives; Residual stress analysis; Selective laser melting; Steel hollow section; Residual stresses","","","","","Science and Technology Development Fund, STDF, (073/2015/A2, 129/2014/A3); Science and Technology Development Fund, STDF; Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, (JCYJ20180504165824643); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, (2017B090911003); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province","This research was supported by The Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR (File no. 129/2014/A3 , and File no. 073/2015/A2 ), Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission (grant number JCYJ20180504165824643 ), as well as a grant from Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province of China (grant number 2017B090911003) .","Zhou Y.H., Li W.P., Wang D.W., Zhang L., Ohara K., Shen J., Ebel T., Yan M., Selective laser melting enabled additive manufacturing of Ti–22Al–25Nb intermetallic: Excellent combination of strength and ductility, and unique microstructural features associated, Acta Mater., 173, pp. 117-129, (2019); Srinivas M., Babu B.S., A critical review on recent research methodologies in additive manufacturing, Mater.

The current work focuses on the influence of varying laser energy density (ED), which is adjusted by different sets of laser power (P) and scan speed (v), on the microstructure-tensile property relationships of the L-PBF-fabricated Al–2.5%Fe alloy under varying laser conditions (P = 204–230 W, v = 450–600 mm/s) with a fixed powder layer thickness (t = 30 μm) and hatch distance (h = 30 μm). With increasing ED (= P/v·t·h), a slight increase in the average size of the columnar α-Al grains was found in the experimental samples concurrently with a higher fraction of <001>-oriented grains. Nanosized particles of the Al6Fe phase with an increased tendency to interconnect were observed in the matrix inside the melt pool, and the θ phase formed within the submicron-sized cellular structure along the melt pool boundaries (MPBs). A low tensile ductility, induced by the local microstructural inhomogeneities across MPBs, was found in all specimens tensile-deformed along the building direction, which was characterized by a preference fracture along the MPBs. At higher applied ED, the tensile ductility of the experimental Al–2.5Fe alloy was significantly improved with only a slight decrease in tensile strength. The difference in concentration of Fe across the MPBs in the matrix was also moderately diminished, which is consistent with the reduced local difference in microhardness across the MPBs under higher ED conditions. Therefore, the present results demonstrate that local microstructural inhomogeneities across MPBs can be controlled by the laser conditions, thereby producing both high strength and good ductility in the L-PBF processed Al–Fe alloys. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Al–Fe alloys; Laser powder bed fusion; Microstructure; Tensile properties; Volumetric energy density","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Ductility; High strength alloys; Iron alloys; Tensile strength; Al-Fe alloys; Energy density; Laser conditions; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; matrix; Melt pool; Powder bed; Tensile ductility; Volumetric energy densities; Microstructure","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (20H02462); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN; China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201806890005); China Scholarship Council, CSC; Light Metal Educational Foundation","We would like to thank Dr. Isao Murakami (Toyo Aluminium K.K.) for preparing the alloy powder.

However, the layer-by-layer manufacturing procedure causes a nonnegligible thermal accumulation and cycling. Thus, the SLM-deposited component always presents gradient microstructure and mechanical properties. In this work, the dense TiB2p/2024Al composite prepared by SLM was employed to investigate the heat-induced microstructure evolution and mechanical properties. The as-deposited composite presents a uniform distribution of TiB2 reinforced particle in α-Al matrix with an oriented < 100 > texture α-Al dendrite microstructure. The yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and the elongation of as-deposited sample increase from 230.06 MPa, 302.52 MPa, and 4.49% to 244.17 MPa, 365.36 MPa, and 11.48% from the bottom to top regions. According to the TEM results, this phenomenon is attributed to the high cooling rate induced low content of θ-Al2Cu phase at the bottom of the sample. In addition, agglomeration of the TiB2 particles due to the insufficient convention is responsible to the poor elongation at the bottom of the sample. After the solid solution and aging heat treatment (T6), thanks to the uniform distribution of S strengthening phases, this gradient in microstructure and mechanical properties in the deposit can be eliminated, and the deposit presents higher YS, UTS, and a lower elongation of 380.23 MPa, 421.50 MPa, and 3.14%. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Additive manufacturing; Gradient structure; Heat treatment; Microstructure; Selective laser melting; Tensile properties","Additives; Aluminum compounds; Deposits; Elongation; Heat treatment; Melting; Metallic matrix composites; Selective laser melting; Textures; Titanium compounds; Gradient structure; Manufacturing techniques; Matrix composite; Metal matrix; Microstructure evolutions; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Selective laser melting; Thermal behaviours; Ultimate tensile strength; Uniform distribution; Tensile strength","","","","","National Outstanding Youth Science Fund Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China, IUSS, (52005411); National Outstanding Youth Science Fund Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China, IUSS; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Northwestern Polytechnical University, NPU, (2020-TZ-02); Northwestern Polytechnical University, NPU; China Scholarship Council, CSC, (202106290075); China Scholarship Council, CSC; State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing, SKLSP; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFB1100100); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","The work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFB1100100), National Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. 52005411), the Research Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing (NPU), China (Grant No. 2020-TZ-02), and the China Scholarship Council (Grant No.202106290075).

Strain-controlled axial, torsional and proportional tests with Rɛ=0 were carried out at 20 °C and 450 °C using thin-walled specimens, resulting in fatigue lives ranging from 103 to 105 cycles. SLM Inconel 718 exhibits a columnar microstructure along the build direction, and the dominant defect related to the manufacturing process was gas pores. Fatigue crack initiation occurred a carbides and/or metallic inclusions for all tests and, therefore, intrinsic defects related to the manufacturing process did not induce premature initiation of fatigue cracks. The orientation of macroscopic fatigue cracks was consistent with the plane of maximum shear stress for all loading conditions. The fatigue crack propagation mechanism of SLM Inconel 718, on the other hand, depends on the loading path and temperature. Both the equivalent strain amplitude and the Fatemi–Socie criterion could correlate fatigue life of all loading conditions at 20 °C and 450 °C within factor-of-two boundaries. As a general trend, the fatigue endurance of SLM Inconel 718 is inferior to its forged counterpart, especially at 450 °C. The cyclic plasticity behaviour of SLM and forged Inconel 718 is similar at both 20 °C and 450 °C and can be simulated by the Chaboche model. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Cyclic plasticity; Elevated temperature; Inconel 718; Multiaxial fatigue; Selective laser melting","Carbides; Melting; Plasticity; Selective laser melting; Shear stress; Stress analysis; Thin walled structures; Cyclic plasticity; Elevated temperature; Fatigue cracks; Inconel-718; Loading condition; Manufacturing process; Multi-axial fatigue; Room and high temperatures; Selective laser melting; Strain-controlled; Fatigue crack propagation","","","","","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (305302/2017-5, 307330/2019-2); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Safran; Safran Aircraft Engines","The authors would like to thank SAFRAN and Safran Aircraft Engines for funding this research work and for providing the material.

SLM process can inevitably cause various defects in the products due to the rapid melting and solidification of metal powder. The key factors that affect the dynamic properties of additive manufacturing products using titanium powders may differ from the factors that affect quasi-static properties. This study aimed to control defects such as pores, unmelted powders, and lack of fusion by changing the energy density among the SLM process conditions. The changes in texture and volume fraction of the irregular and regular regions were analyzed according to the energy density. The acicular α′ martensite fraction increased as the energy density increased, and the quasi-static mechanical properties could be improved by forming Widmanstätten microstructure with relatively random orientations after an additional hot isostatic pressing treatment. The SLM-fabricated Ti–6Al–4V alloy showed very high cycle fatigue strength (714 MPa), which was an excellent dynamic fatigue property compared to the existing wrought Ti–6Al–4V alloy, by improving resistance to fatigue crack propagation by irregularly oriented microstructure. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","","Additives; Defects; Density (specific gravity); Dynamics; Fatigue crack propagation; Fatigue of materials; Hot isostatic pressing; Melting; Powder metals; Textures; Energy density; Heat sources; High laser power; Laser melting process; Melting and solidification; Melting techniques; Quasi-dynamics; Quasi-static; Selective laser melting; Static and dynamic mechanical properties; Selective laser melting","","","","","Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE; Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology, KIAT, (P0002019); Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology, KIAT; Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology, KEIT, (10053101, 20010047); Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology, KEIT","This work was supported by the Korean government MOTIE (the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy), the Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology (KEIT) (No. 10053101, No. 20010047), and the Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology (KIAT) (No. P0002019).

The specific heat capacity, linear thermal expansion, and thermal diffusivity were measured from room temperature to ~ 1000 °C. The thermal conductivity values were calculated using the above values. The thermal diffusivity values of all samples along the build direction are similar and a few percent higher than those perpendicular to the build direction. The effect of measurement direction on the linear thermal expansion is evident and related to the processing conditions. A correction for the effect of low porosity (<1%) on thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity shows that regardless of production method, the porosity corrected values are close for all the PBF samples. Attempts were made to correlate the subtle differences between the samples to the oxygen content, microstructure processing route, and preferred orientation. In the E-PBF samples with a lower cooling rate during production, thermal expansion and thermal diffusivity were nearly isotropic. The subtle changes between the E-PBF samples in both directions directly correlate to a preferred orientation parameter, the peak intensity ratio I(002)α/I(101)α. These results were compared to both cast and additive manufacturing literature, and differences were discussed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Electron beam powder bed fusion (E-PBF); Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF); Thermal conductivity; Thermal diffusivity; Thermal expansion; Ti-6Al-4V","Aluminum alloys; Diffusion; Electron beams; Porosity; Specific heat; Ternary alloys; Thermal conductivity; Thermal diffusivity; Titanium alloys; Build direction; Electron beam powder bed fusion; Electron-beam; Fusion methods; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Linear thermal expansions; Powder bed; Ti-6al-4v; Thermal expansion","","","","","Ministry of Science, Technology and Space, MOST, (2022851); Ministry of Science, Technology and Space, MOST","The Israeli Ministry of Science, Technology, and Space (MOST) supported this research (grant no. 2022851).

Their consistency and reliability has been demonstrated over the years through numerous laboratory validation tests and industrial applications. Nevertheless, both their theoretical definition and their subsequent validation have been performed in metallic materials and, therefore, their use in other types of materials still requires theoretical support and experimental validation. Moreover, FADs have been initially defined for the analysis of crack-like defects, whereas there are many situations where the defects that are, or might be, responsible for structural failure are not necessarily cracks. This is the case of (non-sharp) defects with a finite radius on their tip, which here will be referred to as notches. Simultaneously, additive manufacturing (AM) is an emergent technology that allows practically any type of geometry to be fabricated through a relatively simple process. One of the main AM techniques is fused deposition modelling (FDM), which consists in the extrusion of heated feedstock plastic filaments through a nozzle tip. The resultant printed materials have rather particular properties that are very dependent on the printing parameters and on the final state of internal defects. Concerning AM polymers and polymer-matrix composites, their use as structural materials, beyond their main current use in prototyping, requires the development of specific structural integrity assessment procedures. This paper provides FAD analyses for three additively manufactured (FDM) materials containing U-shaped notches: ABS, PLA and graphene reinforced PLA. The results show that the FAD methodology may be applied for the estimation of fracture loads in these particular materials, as long as linear-elastic fracture toughness values are used. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; Failure Assessment Diagram; Fused deposition modelling; Graphene; Notch; Theory of Critical Distances","Additives; Cracks; Deposition; Failure (mechanical); Fracture mechanics; Fracture toughness; Fused Deposition Modeling; Polymer matrix composites; Reinforcement; Structural integrity; Styrene; Engineering tools; Failure assessment diagram; Metallic material; Notch; Notched specimens; Structural component; Structural integrity assessment; Structural integrity assessment procedures; Theory of critical distances; Validation test; Graphene","","","","","Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras, FEDER; Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI","This publication is part of the project “Comportamiento en fractura de materiales compuestos nano-reforzados con defectos tipo entalla, PGC2018-095400-B-I00” funded by MCIN/ AEI /10.13039/501100011033/ FEDER “Una manera de hacer Europa”.

Green cermets like the TiC-430 L AISI ferritic stainless steel (430 L-FSS) have been fabricated using the AM process like laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) process or also known as selective laser melting (SLM). Multiple laser scanning was employed as a tool to preheat and melt the powder bed with different laser scanning parameters for each (two laser scans namely pre-heating scan and melting scan) scan to fabricate crack-free cermets. As a part of the preheating scanning (PHS) and melting scans (MS), different laser energy parameters are used to study the microstructure evolution and to study their densification process and mechanical properties. Lowering the preheating and melting scan speed results in prolonged laser exposure and higher temperature in the powder bed and melt pool, which led to the refinement of the microstructure due to higher cooling rate and generation of the cracks in the as-built parts caused by thermal gradient in the melt pool. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction were performed to study the microstructure and phase analysis of the fabricated sample. Mechanical properties like density, hardness, fracture toughness, and compression tests were performed and discussed in detail. The results suggest that the laser PHS can effectively eliminate the presence of cracks. On the other hand, increasing the energy density of both PHS and MS results in a coarser microstructure with porosity, which also hampers the fracture toughness of these SLM fabricated cermets. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Rescanning; Selective laser melting; Steel binder; Titanium carbide-based cermets","Cermets; Compression testing; Cracks; Density (specific gravity); Fabrication; Fracture toughness; Melting; Microstructure; Preheating; Scanning electron microscopy; Selective laser melting; Wear resistance; Ceramic-matrix-composites; Fusion process; Laser powders; Laser scanning; Melt pool; Powder bed; Rescanning; Selective laser melting; Steel binder; Titania carbide-based cermet; Titanium carbide","","","","","Guangdong International Science and Technology Cooperation Program - China, (2021A0505050002); Eesti Teadusagentuur, ETAg, (PRG1145); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2020A1515011242); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (ASTRA6–6); High-end Foreign Experts Recruitment Plan of China, (G2021163004L)","This work was supported by Estonian Research Council grants PRG1145 and European Regional Development Grant ASTRA6–6 .

Here we used fused deposition modelling (FDM) and melt electrowriting (MEW) to investigate how scaffold microarchitecture influences the healing of large bone defects. FDM was used to fabricate scaffolds with relatively large fibre diameters and low porosities, while MEW was used to fabricate scaffolds with smaller fibre diameters and higher porosities, with both scaffolds being designed to have comparable surface areas. Scaffold microarchitecture significantly influenced the healing response following implantation into critically sized femoral defects in rats, with the FDM scaffolds supporting the formation of larger bone spicules through its pores, while the MEW scaffolds supported the formation of a more round bone front during healing. After 12 weeks in vivo, both MEW and FDM scaffolds supported significantly higher levels of defect vascularisation compared to empty controls, while the MEW scaffolds supported higher levels of new bone formation. Somewhat surprisingly, this superior healing in the MEW group did not correlate with higher levels of angiogenesis, with the FDM scaffold supporting greater total vessel formation and the formation of larger vessels, while the MEW scaffold promoted the formation of a dense microvasculature with minimal evidence of larger vessels infiltrating the defect region. To conclude, the small fibre diameter, high porosity and high specific surface area of the MEW scaffold proved beneficial for osteogenesis and bone regeneration, demonstrating that changes in scaffold architecture enabled by this additive manufacturing technique can dramatically modulate angiogenesis and tissue regeneration without the need for complex exogenous growth factors. These results provide a valuable insight into the importance of 3D printed scaffold architecture when developing new bone TE strategies.  © 2022 The Author(s).

While providing a host of design benefits, these materials also can have a large detrimental effect on the environment when not handled properly. One of the best ways to increase the sustainability of systems created using these materials is to extend their operating life as much as possible. Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies offer a powerful tool for this, as they allow easy repair of damaged or worn components in an automated or semi-automated way. This article explores the use of the fused filament fabrication (FFF) process as a tool for repairing high-value (i.e., difficult or expensive to replace) thermoplastic parts. The major design opportunities and restrictions are presented, as well as an evaluation of the types of repair jobs for which this process could be suitable and effective. Advice and ideas for future implementations and improvements are provided as well. A detailed case study is presented, where cracked ABS bars were repaired using FFF-deposited patches while varying the print parameters using a factorial designed experiment. The repaired bars were tested against the baseline and in most cases were found to be as good as or better than the original bars under a bending load. This case study demonstrates the concepts and explores how this repair approach could be realistically employed in practice. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; fused filament fabrication; plastics manufacturing; repair; sustainability","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (MOM-1926353, MOM-1926353)","This research was partially supported (C.C. and I.M.J.) by the U.S. National Science Foundation grant MOM-1926353.","Andrady A.L., Neal M.A., Applications and societal benefits of plastics, Philos.

Electrochemical corrosion behaviors of as-printed steel parts were evaluated in acidic, basic, and neutral aqueous solutions, including 10% H2SO4, 3.5% NaCl, 10% NaOH and 10% Na2S. The crystallographic phases and microstructure of as-fabricated steel parts were determined by x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. Meanwhile, electrochemical corrosion behaviors of as-built steel parts by LCD and SLM processes in the corroding solution were evaluated by immersion test, potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The results show that as-printed steel parts mainly contained martensite phase and a small quantity of retained austenite. The density of LCD steel part was much more than that of SLM steel part. LCD steel part comprised high martensite content due to high power for Nd:YAG solid pulse laser. Electrochemical corrosion resistance of SLM steel part was better than that of LCD steel part in 10% H2SO4 solution due to high volume fraction of retained austenite unevenly distributed in SLM steel part. However, the corrosion resistance of as-melted steel part by LCD process has an opposite effect in other corrosive solutions due to high density and better chemical homogeneity, compared with as-built steel part by SLM process. The corrosion rates of 18Ni 300 maraging steel parts printed by LCD and SLM processes in the corroding solution ascended in the order of NaOH < NaCl < Na2S < H2SO4. © 2022, ASM International.","additive manufacturing; electrochemical corrosion; laser cladding deposition; maraging steel; selective laser melting","Austenite; Austenitic stainless steel; Corrosion rate; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant coatings; Corrosive effects; Deposition; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Maraging steel; Melting; Neodymium lasers; Scanning electron microscopy; Selective laser melting; Sodium alloys; Sodium chloride; Sodium hydroxide; Steel corrosion; Yttrium aluminum garnet; Acidic aqueous solution; Comparatives studies; Corroding solutions; Corrosive media; Electrochemical corrosion behavior; Laser cladding deposition; Laser melting process; Powder bed; Selective laser melting; Steel parts; Electrochemical corrosion","","","","","Changzhou Sci and Tech Program, (CJ20190041); Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province, (SIETP-2106, SJCX22_1429); Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo, (2014A610057, 2018A610064); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51875053)","This work was supported by the funding of Ningbo Natural Science Foundation (No.2014A610057 and No. 2018A610064), Changzhou Sci and Tech Program (Grant No. CJ20190041) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.51875053), Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (Grant no.

Duranti 93, Perugia, 06125, Italy","The industrial interest in additive manufacturing (AM) techniques is currently increasing for the realization of functional mechanical components. For this reason, the structural simulation of parts or complete structures made using this new manufacturing technique is gaining considerable importance. To realise accurate finite element models for the purpose of predicting the dynamic or static behaviour of the component printed and avoid unexpected failures, it is necessary to be aware of some mechanical and physical properties of the print material. Unfortunately, in the literature, it is very difficult to find all the data necessary to perform static or dynamic simulations of 3D printed parts. In this context, this activity aims to determine all these mechanical and physical properties for parts made in White-Pearl Polylactic-acid (PLA) Ultimaker filament using the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) technique. A set of printing parameters was chosen and kept constant in all tests which, based on literature data, maximizes the static strength and the fatigue limit of the component. Only the building direction was varied to increase the applicability of the obtained results to any geometry. The main results found for the horizontally moulded specimens (representing the best constructive solution) are the Ultimate Tensile Strength equal to 57.15 MPa, the elastic modulus 2606 MPa, the fatigue limit evaluated at 2 × 10 6 cycles equal to 13.5 MPa, the damping and density of the material of 0.008 dimensionless value and 1.1246 g/cm3, respectively. Only thanks to the obtained results, finite element models can be developed for reliable static and dynamic analysis. © 2022, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; DMA test; Fatigue test; Mechanical behaviour; Polylactide PLA; Tensile test","","","","","","Università degli Studi di Perugia, (RICBA19FC); Università degli Studi di Perugia","Funding text 1: The research was funded by University of Perugia through its program for Basic Research 2019 and its financing through the project RICBA19FC. ; Funding text 2: The author wishes to thank the University of Perugia which supported this research through its program for Basic Research 2019 and its financing through the project RICBA19FC ","Juarez J.L., A methodology for transitioning from metallic parts to plastic injected components., (2003); Landi L., Stecconi A., Morettini G., Cianetti F., Analytical procedure for the optimization of plastic gear tooth root, Mech Mach Theory, (2021); Allevi G., Capponi L., Castellini P., Chiariotti P., Docchio F., Freni F., Tomasini E.P., Investigating additive manufactured lattice structures: a multi-instrument approach, IEEE Trans Instrum Meas, 69, 5, pp. 2459-2467, (2019); Montanini R., Rossi G., Quattrocchi A., Alizzio D., Capponi L., Marsili R., Tocci T., Structural characterization of complex lattice parts by means of optical non-contact measurements, 2020 IEEE International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference (I2MTC).

Polymeric polylactic acid (PLA) has been widely used in FDM attributed to its recyclable, renewable, degradable and biocompatible characteristics. However, the material properties of polymeric materials can be largely affected by temperature and strain rate; and the mechanical behavior of polymer printed by FDM are fairly different from those manufactured by traditional technology. In this study, uniaxial tensile tests of the PLA specimens printed by FDM are performed under different strain rates and temperatures. For the first time, the digital image correlation (DIC) technique is employed to capture the surface strain of the AM specimens under loading, allowing us to quantify thermal stress concentration in the FDM printed polymer. Significant strain localization induced by the embrittlement of PLA is identified by the DIC system. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) technique is used to characterize the failure modes and failure mechanisms of the printed PLA samples. With increasing strain rate or decreasing temperature, the ductile to brittle failure modes can be observed by SEM. The modified Zener model is developed here to predict the stress–strain responses accounting for the combined effects of strain rate and temperature with proper modeling accuracy. The Cowper–Symonds material model is also employed to describe the effect of the strain rate on yield strength with a maximum 3.2% relative error between the experimental results and the theoretical model. Further, the yield strength, failure strain and Young's modulus show a strong linear correlation with temperature. This study is anticipated to provide an effective and precise material model for the mechanical analysis of composite structural components made by the additive manufacturing process. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Fused deposition modeling (FDM); Mechanical properties; Modified Zener model; Polylactic acid (PLA); Strain rate and temperature dependent","Additives; Biocompatibility; Deposition; Elastic moduli; Failure (mechanical); Layered manufacturing; Mechanisms; Polyesters; Scanning electron microscopy; Strain rate; Stress-strain curves; Tensile testing; Yield stress; Fused deposition modeling; Material modeling; Modified zener model; Polylactic acid; Scanning electrons; Strain-rate-dependent; Strain-rates; Strain-temperature; Temperature dependent; Zener model; Fused Deposition Modeling","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52075157); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2021JJ30122); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 52075157 ), Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China ( 2021JJ30122 ) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China .","Penumakala P.K., Santo J., Thomas A., A critical review on the fused deposition modeling of thermoplastic polymer composites, Composites B, 201, (2020); Zhuo P., Li S., Ashcroft I.A., Jones A.I., Material extrusion additive manufacturing of continuous fibre reinforced polymer matrix composites: A review and outlook, Composites B, 224, (2021); Hull C.W., Apparatus for production of three-dimensional objects by stereolithography, United States Patent, Appl, No 638905, Filed, (1984); Wang X., Jiang M., Zhou Z., Gou J., Hui D., 3D printing of polymer matrix composites: A review and prospective, Composites B, 110, pp. 442-458, (2017); Ngo T.D., Kashani A., Imbalzano G., Nguyen K.T.Q., Hui D., Additive manufacturing (3D printing): A review of materials, methods, applications and challenges, Composites B, 143, pp. 172-196, (2018); Wang Z., Xie H., Luo Q., Li Q., Sun G., Optimizaition for formability of plain woven carbon fiber fabrics, Int.

The results demonstrate that the addition of Ti nanoparticles (i) enlarges the parameter window of SLM processing (power inputs of 200–350 W and scanning speeds of 600–1600 mm/s), (ii) stimulates a columnar to equiaxed transition and refinement of grains (average grain size decreases from 9.0 μm to 1.5 μm), (iii) forms Al3Ti phase improving the thermal stability of Al–Si eutectic cell structure, and (iv) partially suppresses the precipitation of Si phase and coarsening of cell structure at elevated temperatures. These features lead to an improved yield strength of SLM Al–12Si–Ti compared with SLM Al–12Si. Specifically, SLM Al–12Si–Ti annealed at 573 K possesses a higher yield strength (297 ± 10 MPa) than SLM Al–12Si (207 ± 9 MPa) annealed at the same conditions. This study will pave the way for the design and synthesis of SLM Al alloys with improved structural and mechanical stability by minor alloying via nanoparticle addition. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Al alloys; Heat treatment; Mechanical properties; Microstructure","Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Coarsening; Heat treatment; Mechanical stability; Nanoparticles; Precipitation (chemical); Silicon; Silicon alloys; Synthesis (chemical); Textures; Titanium alloys; Yield stress; Al-alloy; Cell structure; Elevated temperature; Mechanical performance; Powder mixtures; Power input; Processing power; Synthesised; Ti alloys; Titania; 3D printers","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (MA 3333/13-1); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52005340, 52105385); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, ÖAW; Shenzhen University, SZU; Shenzhen International Cooperation Research Project, (GJHZ20190822095418365); Shenzhen International Cooperation Research Project; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2020A1515110869, 2022A1515010781); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","Funding text 1: P Wang would like to thank Dr. X.

Fig. 6 shows a HAADF-STEM image and the corresponding EDS maps for the SLM Al–12Si–Ti alloy. Cuboidal particles are clearly observed in the grain interior and at the grain boundaries. The size of these Ti-rich particles ranges from 30 nm to 100 nm. According to EDS analysis, these cuboidal particles contain Al and Ti (74.4 ± 0.7 at.% Al and 25.6 ± 0.7 at.% Ti). The electron diffraction patterns of ɑ-Al phase and Al3Ti phase are shown in the inset. Previous studies have shown that Al3Ti can have two different crystal structures: D022-Al3Ti (lattice constants: a = 3.85 Å and c = 8.60 Å [64]) or L12-Al3Ti (the lattice constant: a = 4.05 Å [65]). Tan et al. [66] reported that L12-Al3Ti is highly likely to form at higher cooling rate. According to the indexed diffraction patterns and EDS analysis, these cuboidal particles are confirmed as D022-Al3Ti (the lattice constants: a = 3.84 Å and c = 8.60 Å). Compared with Tan et al.'s study, the SLM Al–12Si–Ti alloy in this work was prepared at higher volume-energy density (lower cooling rate) [15]. Therefore, the lower cooling rate stimulates the formation of D022-Al3Ti. All TEM results are in accordance with the XRD patterns and the EBSD results, which provides strong support to the analysis of the heat treatment and mechanical properties.P Wang would like to thank Dr. X.

We calculate phase corrections before (ex-situ) and after (in-situ) a high numerical aperture microscope objective using a spatial light modulator (SLM), and investigate how these corrections can be used to improve the efficiency and resolution of micro-structures fabricated through two-photon-photopolymerisation (2PP). We apply a phase retrieval algorithm to correct for distortions in a femtosecond laser that enables the fabrication of 3D structures using as many as 50 simultaneous foci. The inclusion of aberration correction in the fabrication process shows improved confinement of optically trapped particles and more efficient polymerisation while minimising intensity variations at individual foci, which potentially damage the structure during fabrication. We find that phase corrections allow for consistent voxel sizes, increased sharpness, and an expanded effective printing range when using an SLM, while also allowing for closer proximity of individual trap foci, minimising interference effects that hinder fabrication resolution.

The properties of manufactured parts have been proven to be dependent on not only the material’s inherent properties but importantly the FFF process parameters. Commodity thermoplastics such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA) have been on the forefront of FFF research since its development. However, as FFF technology progresses from rapid prototyping to rapid manufacturing, understanding the behaviour of high-performance engineering thermoplastics in this process is imperative. While previous studies have investigated the effects of FFF process parameters on polyether ether ketone (PEEK) and polyetherimide (PEI), more limited research has been performed on polyether ketone ketone (PEKK) despite its widespread applications in the biomedical and aerospace industries. This study investigated the effects of process parameters including build orientation, infill pattern, number of contours and raster angle on the tensile properties of PEKK. Tensile test results showed significant variations in Young’s modulus and elongation at break. Statistical analysis was performed which determined the optimum process parameters to maximize tensile properties and revealed that build orientation was the most significant parameter, followed by number of contours. Fractography showed differences in failure mode and ductility among the sample groups. Analysis using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that the difference in percentage crystallinity among sample groups was not significant and thus the varied tensile properties was improbable to be due to differences in crystallinity developed within the specimens. Further analysis revealed that a variation in FFF process parameters can cause differences in percentage, size and location of porosity which in turn affects mechanical properties. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Crystallinity; Fused deposition modelling (FDM); Polyether ketone ketone (PEKK); Porosity; Tensile strength","Aerospace industry; Differential scanning calorimetry; Fabrication; Fracture mechanics; Fused Deposition Modeling; Ketones; Porosity; Reinforced plastics; Styrene; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene; Additive manufacturing technology; Build orientation; Cristallinity; End-uses; Fabrication process; Fused deposition modeling; Polyether ketone ketone; Process parameters; Property; Crystallinity","","","","","RMIT University Melbourne City Campus; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the facilities and technical assistance of Advanced Manufacturing Precinct, Process Chemistry and Environmental Technical Services, and Australian Microscopy and Microanalysis Facility, all of which are part of RMIT University Melbourne City Campus.; Funding text 2: This research was funded by Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).

However, reliable temperature data are still rather limited to date. This article presents a three-dimensional transient-state model to simulate the temporal and spatial temperature variations in FFF printed parts. Model variables range from geometry dimensions and (dynamic) material properties to process parameters, covering all important physical phenomena, including conduction anisotropy and radiant heat transfer. The validation of the model is performed against six sets of experimental temperature data obtained with different geometries, machines, materials, processes, temperature measuring methods, etc. Insights in the thermal process are also reported. For example, the heat penetration depth in printing with poly(lactic acid) is limited to 3 mm, and the Biot number intimately characterises the reheating peaks in temporal profiles. This model shows the potential to become a standardised tool to study the thermal characteristics of FFF printed parts.

Selective electron beam melting is one of the promising additive manufacturing methods for titanium components. In this work, microstructure and mechanical properties of selective electron beam melted Ti6Al4V alloy were investigated. A non-theoretical α/α misorientation angle of 30°/[1 1 −2 0] is detected in the β → α phase transformation, which can aid in the act of deformation behavior during tensile testing. The horizontally built specimens exhibit a higher strain rate sensitivity of 0.005–0.017. While the highest strength occurs in selective electron beam melted 45°-oriented built tensile specimens due to texture effect of α variants. Cyclic stabilization mostly remained except mild cyclic softening happened above 0.6%. An energy density-based model integrated with the accumulative damage process is employed to predict fatigue life via a modified method for evaluating of intrinsic fatigue toughness, which is defined as the sum of all hysteresis loop areas from the first cycle to the last cycle. This method is expected to promote the practical application of selective electron beam melted Ti6Al4V material. © 2022","Energy density-based model; Fatigue life; Low-cycle fatigue; Selective electron beam melting; Ti6Al4V alloy","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Electron beam melting; Electrons; Low-cycle fatigue; Strain rate; Tensile testing; Ternary alloys; Textures; Titanium alloys; Density-based model; Electron-beam; Energy density; Energy density-based model; Fatigue performance; Key elements; Low cycle fatigues; Manufacturing IS; Selective electron beam melting; Ti-6Al-4V alloy; Electron beams","","","","","Ryerson University; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51901151, 51905321, 51905322); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2020M680918, 2021T140420, 2021T140503); China Scholarship Council, CSC; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, (ZR2021QA041)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by China Scholarship Council; National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No: 51901151, 51905321, 51905322); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (ZR2021QA041); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2020M680918, 2021T140503, 2021T140420). ; Funding text 2: This work was supported by China Scholarship Council; National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No: 51901151, 51905321, 51905322); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (ZR2021QA041); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2020M680918, 2021T140503, 2021T140420).

This work contributes unique insights regarding the effects of polymer composite feedstocks with metal, ceramic, or carbonaceous particle additives on particulate emissions in a variety of filaments under various print conditions, including print temperature. In addition to active characterization of particulate size and concentration following the ANSI/CAN/UL 2904 method, particulate sampling and subsequent analysis by scanning electron microscopy revealed agglomeration behavior that may have important health implications. Specifically, fine particles (0.3–2.5 μm) generated by certain filaments including acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and glycol-modified poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PETG) are shown to be formed via agglomeration of emitted ultrafine particles rather than composed of coherent primary particles; accordingly, transport and behavior of these particulates after inhalation may not follow expected patterns for micrometer-sized particles. Structures resembling carbonaceous additives (e.g., graphene and nanotubes) were also captured by airborne sampling during printing of filaments containing carbonaceous advanced materials. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The mechanical properties of maraging steel metal materials before and after laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) polishing were compared and analyzed. The influence of laser parameters on the formability of high-strength MS metal materials was studied, with MS additive parts successfully prepared. The initial surfaces had roughness values of 6.198–7.92 μm. The metal additive manufacturing parts were polished with double laser beams. Confocal microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction were used to obtain the microstructure and phase composition of the microstructures. The microhardness of high-strength maraging forming parts by using a microhardness tester and the mechanical properties were analyzed. The results showed that the surface roughness was considerably reduced to lengthen the service life of the high-strength MS metal materials from an initial roughness of Sa = 6.3 μm to Sa = 0.98 μm, with the surface hardness increased and the martensite content decreased after using double-laser-beam polishing. © 2022 by the authors.","double-laser-beam polishing; high-strength maraging steel metal material; metal additive manufacturing; structure design; topology optimization","","","","","","School-Enterprise Collaborative Project of Shenzhen Institute of Information Technology, (SZIIT2022KJ075); Scientific Research Project of General Universities in Guangdong Province, (2021KCXTD058, 2022ZDZX3073); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, (JSGG20210420091802007); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, (2021A0505030013)","This work was financially supported by the Science and Technology Project of Guangdong Province (grant no. 2021A0505030013), the Scientific Research Project of General Universities in Guangdong Province (grant nos. 2021KCXTD058, 2022ZDZX3073), the Shenzhen Science and Technology Plan (grant nos.JSGG20191230162001814, JSGG20210420091802007), and the School-Enterprise Collaborative Project of Shenzhen Institute of Information Technology (grant no.

In this study, we propose that the optimization of AM process parameters should not only maximize build quality, but also minimize environmental impact and build time. A multi-objective optimization problem of maximizing relative density (RD), minimizing energy consumption and build time per unit volume (ev and tv respectively) is formulated and solved for selective laser melting (SLM) of Inconel 718 alloy. A high accuracy RD prediction model with R2 of 93.23% is obtained by fitting SLM experiment data from wide ranges of laser power (P), scanning speed (SS), hatch spacing (HS), and layer thickness (LT). The ev and tv models are created considering printing area utilization rate (U) based on laser scanning and powder coating process. The two approaches of Pareto front and global criterion method are adopted for solving the multi-objective optimization problem. It is found that the highest RD of close to 100% can be obtained at the expense of high ev and tv of close to 500 J/mm3 and 0.3 s/mm3, respectively, and about three times ev and tv are needed to increase RD from about 95% to 100% than from 85% to 95%. At the same U level, the solutions obtained from prioritizing ev and tv are consistent, while those from prioritizing RD show smaller process parameter values. The multi-objective optimization formulation provides an enabling tool for industry to obtain high quality SLM-ed parts with improved sustainability and efficiency at the process level. The methodology developed is applicable to selective laser melting of other materials, and such consideration can be readily expanded to other AM processes as well. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Build time; Energy consumption; Inconel 718; Multi-objective optimization; Relative density; Selective laser melting","3D printers; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Feedstocks; Melting; Multiobjective optimization; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Additive manufacturing process; Build time; Energy-consumption; Inconel-718; Multi-objective optimization problem; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimization studies; Process levels; Relative density; Selective laser melting; Energy utilization","","","","","","","Ajay J., Song C., Rathore A.S., Zhou C., Xu W., 3DGates: an instruction-level energy analysis and optimization of 3D printers, ACM SIGPLAN Not., 52, 4, pp. 419-433, (2017); Bai Y., Yang Y., Xiao Z., Zhang M., Wang D., Process optimization and mechanical property evolution of AlSiMg0.75 by selective laser melting, Mater.

In this paper, based on the internal structure of beetle elytra, two bio-inspired honeycomb column thin-walled structures (BHTS) I and II were fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM) technology in additive manufacturing (AM) in order to understand the possible influence of strain rate effect (SRE) on the BHTS under low speed uniaxial compression loading. The influence of three different SREs (0.001 s−1, 0.01 s−1 and 0.1 s−1) on the EA of BHTSs specimens during loading was discussed by means of out-of-plane uniaxial compression tests verified with numerical simulations. The experimental results show that SRE has a significant effect on the EA of BHTSs in low speed out-of-plane uniaxial compression tests: SRE can significantly increase the initial peak crushing force (PCF) and specific energy absorption (SEA) of all types of BHTS specimens. The average increase in PCF/SEA under SRE loading of 0.1 s−1 is 12.70%/9.79% and 17.63 %/11.60%, respectively, compared with 0.001 s−1 and 0.01 s−1. These research methods reduce the use of materials and improve the utilization rate of materials, which can provide important assistance for the design, manufacture and modeling of AM-based materials. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; energy absorption; honeycomb structure; strain rate effect; structure compression","Additives; Biomimetics; Compression testing; Honeycomb structures; Selective laser melting; Strain rate; Thin walled structures; Absorption characteristics; Low speed; Low strain rates; Out-of-plane; Specific energy absorption; Strain rate effect; Structure compression; Thin-walled structures; Uni-axial compression tests; Uniaxial compression loading; Energy absorption","","","","","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2572019AB16)","The financial support provided by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central universities, (Project No. 2572019AB16) is highly appreciated.

To overcome this problem, TiN nanoparticles (0.5 wt.%) were used as an inoculator to promote heterogeneous nucleation of the prior γ-grains, converting the columnar structure into equiaxed and refined grains. As a result, the finer α’-blocks formed upon the subsequent martensitic transformation. This not only leads to the elimination of the property anisotropy, but also simultaneously increases the strength (tensile strength of 2051 ± 48 MPa) and ductility (elongation of 7.4 ± 0.7%) of the SLM-fabricated H13 steel.

Additive manufacturing of alloy 718 using Laser Powder Bed fusion (L-PBF) process poses certain challenges pertaining to complex residual stress, micro-segregation of Nb, and undesired Laves phase formation in the as-printed state. The built-up residual stress and undesired brittle phase may lead to cracks and build failures. This article studied residual stress evolution during L-PBF of alloy 718 using Finite Element (FE) thermo-mechanical simulation implemented in Simufact Additive® software. The model adopted the bundling of physical powder in voxel mesh to minimize the computational time and mimic the actual process scenario during part-scale simulation. Experimental flow curves generated from Gleeble 3800® tests at elevated temperatures were utilized to calibrate material property for better accuracy in the FE simulation. The calibrated model was used to study the residual stress evolution during support structure removal. Verification and validation of simulated results were performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The simulated value agrees well with the experimental value with a maximum deviation of 7%. Finally, the experimentally validated model was used to correlate the effect of layer thickness variation on residual stress evolution. © 2022 The Authors","Additive Manufacturing; Finite Element Method; Laser Powder Bed Fusion; Part Scale Simulation; Residual Stress; Voxel Mesh","3D printers; Additives; Computer software; Mesh generation; Residual stresses; Alloy 718; Laser additive manufacturing; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Manufacturing IS; Part scale simulation; Powder bed; Stress evolution; Thermo-mechanical; Voxel mesh; Finite element method","","","","","","","Clare A., Mishra R., Merklein M., Tan H., Todd I., Chechik L., Li J., Bambach M., Alloy design and adaptation for additive manufacture, J.

This also applies to medical technology applications like hearing aids where patient-specific solutions are required. However, assembly is more challenging than with conventional printed circuit boards in terms of material compatibility between substrate, interconnect material and printed ink. This paper describes how aerosol jet printing of nano metal inks and subsequent assembly processes are utilized to connect electrical components on 3D substrates fabricated by Digital Light Processing (DLP). Conventional assembly technologies such as soldering and conductive adhesive bonding were investigated and characterized. For this purpose, curing methods and substrate pretreatments for different inks were optimized. Furthermore, the usage of electroless plating on printed metal tracks for improved solderability was investigated. Finally, a 3D ear mold substrate was used to build up a technology demonstrator by means of conductive adhesives. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; aerosol jet; conductive adhesive bonding; digital printing; nano metal inks; photonic curing; soldering","","","","","","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (16ES0772); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF","Funding text 1: This research was part of the project “Mikroelektronik für permanente, nichtinvasive Blutdruckmessung im Ohr (MikroBo)” funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), grant number 16ES0772.; Funding text 2: The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) within the research of the funded project “Mikroelektronik für permanente, nichtinvasive Blutdruckmessung im Ohr (MikroBo)”.

Three preliminary curing times of 5, 10 and 15 s were selected for SLA manufacturing. The materials’ friction, hardness and capacitance values were determined by ball cratering, Brinell method and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, respectively. The obtained results showed that the mechanical property values changed most significantly after 10 s of preliminary curing, but friction wear and electrochemical capacitance showed greatest change for samples cured for 15 s. This effect may be explained by the domination of elongation of molecular chains in the first 10 seconds of preliminary curing and the gradual increase of branching processes during the next 15 s. © 2022 by the authors.","hardness; polymers; solidification; stereolithography; wear","","","","","","","","Hutmacher D.W., Scaffold design and fabrication technologies for engineering tissues—State of the art and future perspectives, J.

Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a popular research method that can allow for further interrogation of these questions via the fabrication of 3D hydrogel environments that mimic tissue-specific, complex architectures. However, the adaptation of promising hydrogel biomaterial systems into 3D-printable bioinks remains a challenge. Here, we delineated an approach to that process. First, we characterized a novel methacryloylated gelatin composite hydrogel system and assessed how calcium phosphate and glycosaminoglycan additives upregulated bone- and cartilage-like matrix deposition and certain genetic markers of differentiation within human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), such as RUNX2 and SOX9. Then, new assays were developed and utilized to study the effects of xanthan gum and nanofibrillated cellulose, which allowed for cohesive fiber deposition, reliable droplet formation, and non-fracturing digital light processing (DLP)-printed constructs within extrusion, inkjet, and DLP techniques, respectively. Finally, these bioinks were used to 3D print constructs containing viable encapsulated hMSCs over a 7 d period, where DLP printed constructs facilitated the highest observed increase in cell number over 7 d (∼2.4×). The results presented here describe the promotion of osteochondral phenotypes via these novel composite hydrogel formulations, establish their ability to bioprint viable, cell-encapsulating constructs using three different 3D printing methods on multiple bioprinters, and document how a library of modular bioink additives affected those physicochemical properties important to printability.  © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.","3D printing; bioinks; bioprinting; bone tissue engineering; cartilage tissue engineering; human mesenchymal stem cells; human methacrylated gelatin","Bioprinting; Gelatin; Humans; Hydrogels; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; Additives; Bone; Calcium phosphate; Cartilage; Cell culture; Cell engineering; Deposition; Extrusion; Hydrogels; Physicochemical properties; Stem cells; Tissue engineering; gelatin; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Bioink; Bioprinting; Bone tissue engineering; Cartilage tissue engineering; Composite hydrogels; Digital light processing; Human mesenchymal stem cells; Human methacrylated gelatin; bioprinting; chemistry; human; hydrogel; procedures; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; 3D printers","","gelatin, 9000-70-8; Gelatin, ; Hydrogels, ","","","Baylor College of Medicine Medical Science Training Program; KJH; Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium; National Science Foundation, NSF; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (P41 EB023833); National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIDCR, (F31DE030333); Rice University; U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command, USAMRDC","The authors would like to acknowledge support from the National Institutes of Health (P41 EB023833), the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (MLB), National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (F31 DE030333, KJH), the Baylor College of Medicine Medical Science Training Program (KJH), and the Rice University Sustaining Excellence in Research Scholars Program (ALT).

The relative densities of the samples produced with SrO under medium and low energy density conditions were higher than those produced without SrO, although addition of SrO negatively affected the relative density under the high energy density condition. SrO addition showed significant grain refinement (about 15%) on the 316 L stainless steel alloy during laser-based powder bed fusion. Although it was found that SrO had a negative effect on the mechanical properties under the high energy density condition, significant improvements of the microstructure and mechanical properties was achieved by addition of SrO under the low energy density condition with high scanning velocity. It can be concluded that addition of heterogeneous nucleation site particles is a potential way to control the microstructure and mechanical properties of samples made by laser-based powder bed fusion. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","316 L (Fe-17%Cr-11%Ni-2%Mo) stainless steel; Grain size; Heterogeneous nucleation site particles; Laser-based powder bed fusion (PBF-LB); SrO","Alloy steel; Austenitic stainless steel; Chromium alloys; Density (specific gravity); Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; Microstructure; Strontium compounds; 316 L (fe-17%cr-11%ni-2%mo) stainless steel; Grainsize; Heterogeneous nucleation; Heterogeneous nucleation site particle; Laser-based; Laser-based powder bed fusion (PBF-LB); Ni 2; Nucleation sites; Powder bed; Nucleation","","","","","","","Al-Hashemi H.M.B., Al-Amoudi O.S.B., A review on the angle of repose of granular materials, Powder Tech., 330, pp. 397-417, (2018); Arora S., Haghi M., Loo C.-Y., Traini D., Young P.M., Jain S., Development of an inhaled controlled release voriconazole dry powder formulation for the treatment of respiratory fungal infection, Mol.

Furthermore, the ability to predict mechanical properties by simply considering information on the process parameters and defects observed via X-ray computer tomography (XCT) allows one to avoid expensive destructive testing, provide an in-depth understanding of the process quality and represents a viable solution towards process optimisation. Most of the previous works showed that energy density could be used as an excellent synthetic indicator to predict the mechanical properties of parts produced by L-PBF. This paper explores the effect of different energy density levels on the tensile properties of 316L stainless steel parts produced by L-PBF. Different from previous works in the literature, the same level of energy density is obtained considering various combinations of process parameters (speed, power and hatch distance). While energy density is shown to be a good synthetic indicator for predicting ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and yield strength (YS), a different behaviour is observed for elongation. Elongation shows a significant variability even when samples are produced at the same level of energy density, which contrasts with results obtained for UTS and YS. Synthetic indices representing the porosity structure are shown to be quite significant for predicting elongation even when the optimal energy density is considered. By combining process parameters with porosity structure, we show that almost a full prediction of the tensile properties can be achieved, paving the way for a significant reduction in expensive destructive tests. © 2022, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; AISI 316L; Elongation; L-PBF; Porosity; SLM; Tensile tests; UTS; X-ray computed tomography; YS","","","","","","Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR","The present research was partially supported by the S.I.ADD Project (Soluzioni Innovative per la qualità e la sostenibilità dei processi di ADDitive manufacturing) “MIUR ARS01_00806”.

However, their wear and tribocorrosion properties have not been compared systematically. We simulated the body fluid environment for laboratory comparative analysis. The results revealed that forged TC4 samples exhibited better corrosion resistance than SLM-TC4, and SLM-TC4 exhibited better wear resistance than TC4. Tribocorrosion resistance was significantly affected under conditions of corrosion. The extent of damage realized for the samples was less at a high applied potential (1V) than the extent of damage realized at a low applied potential (0V) under conditions of low-frequency friction (0.083 Hz). It is believed that the oxide formed on the surface plays a protective and lubricative role. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Selective laser melting; Surface oxidation; Titanium alloy; Tribocorrosion","Aluminum alloys; Body fluids; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant alloys; Melting; Selective laser melting; Wear of materials; Wear resistance; Applied potentials; Condition; Manufacturing techniques; Selective laser melting; Surface oxidations; TC4 alloys; Titanium (alloys); Tribo-corrosion; Tribocorrosion behavior; Wear behaviors; Titanium alloys","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51971035, U1964204)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants Nos. 51971035 and U1964204 ).","Jiang K., Wu X., Lei J., Xu B., Zhu L., Cao Y., Li K., Guo D., Zhao Y., Cutting force and tool wear in cutting Ti-6Al-4V using microstructure-based PCD turning tools, Procedia CIRP, 95, pp. 572-577, (2020); Banerjee D., Williams J.C., Perspectives on titanium science and technology, Acta Mater, 61, 3, pp. 844-879, (2013); Arroussi M., Bai C., Zhao J., Zhang S., Xia Z., Jia Q., Et al., Preliminary study on biocorrosion inhibition effect of Ti-5Cu alloy against marine bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Appl Surf Sci, 578, (2022); Alves V.A., Reis R.Q., Santos I.C.B., Souza D.G., de T., Goncalves F., Et al., In situ impedance spectroscopy study of the electrochemical corrosion of Ti and Ti–6Al–4V in simulated body fluid at 25°C and 37°C, Corros Sci, 51, 10, pp. 2473-2482, (2009); Zhang X., Zhang Y., Jin Z., A review of the bio-tribology of medical devices, Friction, 10, 1, pp. 4-30, (2022); Lan C., Wu Y., Guo L., Chen H., Chen F., Microstructure,texture evolution and mechanical properties of cold rolled Ti-32.5Nb-6.8Zr-2.7Sn biomedical beta titanium alloy, J Mater Sci Technol, 34, 5, pp. 788-792, (2018); Liamas E., Thomas O.R.T., Munoz A.I., Zhang Z.J., Tribocorrosion behaviour of pure titanium in bovine serum albumin solution: a multiscale study, J Mech Behav Biomed Mater, 102, (2020); Niinomi M., Mechanical biocompatibilities of titanium alloys for biomedical applications, J Mech Behav Biomed Mater, 1, 1, pp. 30-42, (2008); Breine U., Johansson B., Roylance P.J., Roeckert H., Yoffey J.M., Regeneration of bone marrow.

Generally, the manufactured samples are characterized by high tensile strengths which, however, can be affected by the presence of defects due to the unoptimized process parameters. In a large applications field, a low density of the as-built AlSi10Mg samples is a very important parameter to considered, e.g., due to both the loss of the tensile strengths correlated with a premature failure of the samples and the increase in time and costs associated with the manufacturing process. In addition, different post-process heat treatments can increase these effects leading to an ineffective manufacturing process. In this scenario, the present work shows the analysis of spherical and lack-of-fusion pores induced by the laser powder bed fusion process on the AlSi10Mg samples and their variations after different heat treatments (direct aging and T6). At the same time, the influence of pores on the Vickers microhardness and the tensile properties has been studied in the same AlSi10Mg samples (bars and billets) that were printed with single- and double-laser machine setup. Different process parameters were also analyzed and compared. The study was supported by the microstructural and pore analysis performed by optical microscopy along the XZ plane (build direction) and the XY plane. Finally, the greatest effects of pores were observed on the Vickers microhardness values; in fact, two different relationships between microhardness and density variation are discussed. The T6 heat treatment leads to a rounding of the pores already formed in the as-built samples and to a formation of new small pores.

In this paper, a unique lightweight 3D negative Poisson's ratio auxetic structure is proposed based on the 3D anti-tetra-chiral structure, which can be named as the auxetic contacted cube (ACC). The internal struts of this structure are connected using the hollow cubes, which reduces the stress concentration at the node connections of the contacted struts by avoiding these connections. In addition, the structure possesses the identical periodic unit-cell along all the three orientations in the Cartesian coordinate, therefore it shows the isotropic mechanical properties. The AlSi10Mg ACC specimens with different frame sizes, struts diameters, number of unit-cell, and porosity are prepared using selective laser melting (SLM) techniques. Microstructure analyses are conducted to prove the relative density and formability of the ACC specimen satisfying the preparation requirements of the SLM technology. The mechanic's performance of 27-unit-cells ACC structure with a diameter of 0.5 mm and a porosity of 89.2 % is analyzed using the finite element analysis (FEA) technology, indicating its negative Poisson's ratio, which is in good agreement with the experimental results. The impact of the building directions, the structural dimensions, the struts diameters, the unit-cell numbers, and the porosity on the mechanical performance of this ACC structure are systematically investigated. © 2022 Institution of Structural Engineers","3D-anti-tetra-chiral;

This recrystallization is the result of powder recovery blasting followed by hot isostatic pressing treatment (HIP), which mimics the thermomechanical treatment necessary to achieve globularization in wrought Ti-6Al-4V. The thickness of the globular surface α is variable depending on the blasting intensity as well as the presence of surface protrusions that block the line-of-sight of the blasting media. The globular layer contains a 0001 orientation relationship parallel to the blasting direction, plus a low intragranular orientation deviation, when compared to the bulk. The results indicate that this globular α at the surface may be present for all net-shape Ti-6Al-4V components that have been manufactured via PBF-EB and subjected to a HIP treatment. Tunable fatigue and wear performance may be possible through controlled blasting parameters and globular surface layer thickness. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Hot isostatic pressing; Powder recovery; Recrystallization; Ti-6Al-4V","3D printers; Blasting; Electron beams; Hot isostatic pressing; Recrystallization (metallurgy); Sintering; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Electron-beam; Globularization; Hot-isostatic pressings; Net-shape; Powder bed; Powder recovery; Recovery blasting; Recrystallisation; Surface layers; Ti-6al-4v; Aluminum alloys","","","","","","","Harun W.S., Manam N.S., Kamariah M.S., Sharif S., Zulkifly A.H., Ahmad I., Miura H., A review of powdered additive manufacturing techniques for Ti-6al-4v biomedical applications, Powder Technol., 331, pp. 74-97, (2018); Hrabe N., Barbosa N., Daniewicz S., Shamsaei N., Findings from the NIST/ASTM Workshop on Mechanical Behavior of Additive Manufacturing Components, NIST Advanced Manufacturing Series, (2016); ASTM F2924-14, Standard Specification for Additive Manufacturing Titanium-6 Aluminum-4 Vanadium with Powder Bed Fusion, ASTM Standards, (2014); Svensson M., Material Properties of EBM-Manufactured Ti-6Al-4V & Ti-6Al-4V ELI Under Raw and HIP Conditions, Arcam AB Internal Report, pp. 1-47, (2009); Molaei R., Fatemi A., Phan N., Significance of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) on multiaxial deformation and fatigue behaviors of additive manufactured Ti-6Al-4V including build orientation and surface roughness effects, Int.

In Rapid Investment Casting, these characteristics can be affected by the printing parameters of the Additive Manufacturing method used in the pattern production process. Stereolithography is one of the important AM techniques mostly exploited in RIC due to its accuracy, smooth surface, and precision. However, the effect of SLA printing parameters on the dimensional accuracy and geometric characteristics have not been studied thoroughly. This study considers an experimental approach to study the effect of SLA printing parameters such as layer thickness, build angle, support structure density, and support touchpoint size on the dimensional accuracy and geometrical characteristics of the Castable Wax printed patterns and the Al cast parts. Taguchi’s Design of Experiment was used to define the number of experimental runs. SolidCast simulation was used to design the orientation of casting feeder to achieve directional solidification. Coordinate Measuring Machine measurements of deviations in the printed and cast parts were analyzed using the “Smaller-the-better” scheme in the two-step optimization method of Taguchi experiments. Build angle and Layer thickness were identified to be the first and the second most impactful parameters, respectively, affecting both the dimensional and geometric accuracy of Castable Wax patterns and Al cast parts, with optimal values of 0 deg and 0.25 μm, respectively. Both printed and cast parts had twice as many deviations in geometry as in dimensions. The sphere roundness and angularity were found to be the most and least accurate geometric characteristics, respectively. The dimensions in the Z direction were more accurate than in the X-Y directions, showing the smallest size deviations for height measurements and large deviations in the length, width, and diameter of the hole. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; dimensional accuracy; rapid investment casting; stereolithography","","","","","","Ministry of Industry and Infrastructure Development of the Republic of Kazakhstan","This research was funded under the target program No OR07665556 for project entitled “Additive Manufacturing Systems and Metal Powders for the Kazakhstani industry”, by the Ministry of Industry and Infrastructure Development of the Republic of Kazakhstan.","Berman S., Investment Castings | What Are Investment Castings Used for?, (2017); Mukhtarkhanov M., Perveen A., Talamona D., Application of Stereolithography Based 3D Printing Technology in Investment Casting, Micromachines, 11, (2020); Pattnaik S., Jha P.K., Karunakar D.B., A review of rapid prototyping integrated investment casting processes, Proc.

The electrochemical biosensors became a research hotspot due to their excellent properties. In this study, dicopper hydroxide phosphate (Cu2(OH)PO4) was incorporated in resin, and the resin sheets were prepared by digital light processing (DLP). The copper base points were activated on the resin sheet surface by Nd: YAG laser and then covered by the electroless copper plating and the electroless silver plating. The laser could effectively activate copper base points on the resin surface. Furthermore, silver electrodes on the detection chips could distinguish glucose solutions of different concentrations well. Finally, a novel detection kit with a three-electrode chip was designed for rapid health testing at home or in medical institutions in the future. © 2022 by the authors.","biosensor; DLP; electroless plating; glucose testing; laser activation","","","","","","Key Research and Development Program of Jiangsu Provincial Department of Science and Technology of China, (BE2019002)","This research was funded by the Key Research and Development Program of Jiangsu Provincial Department of Science and Technology of China, grant number BE2019002.","Lunyera J., Diamantidis C.J., Bosworth H.B., Patel U.D., Bain J., Muehlbauer M.J., Ilkayeva O., Nguyen M., Sharma B., Ma J.Z., Et al., Urine tricarboxylic acid cycle signatures of early-stage diabetic kidney disease, Metabolomics, 18, (2022); Franiek A., Sharma A., Cockovski V., Wishart D.S., Zappitelli M., Blydt-Hansen T.D., Urinary metabolomics to develop predictors for pediatric acute kidney injury, Pediatr.

A systematic approach to knowledge transfer from biological concepts to technical applications has made significant progress in the last 10 years, and bio-derived developments are frequently described as sustainable. However, it should be noted that research into the application of bio-inspired geometry in 3D printed building envelopes (3DPBE) is still in its early stages. The goal of this paper is to identify ongoing research trends and current gaps in nature-inspired 3DPBE, through a systematic literature review. The objective of this study is to investigate and synthesise domain knowledge, as well as to identify the current trends and gaps in nature-inspired patterns and their application in 3DPBE. A three-stage methodology was used to identify research gaps, current trends, and future directions in 3DPBE inspired by nature. Scopus was used as a literature search database, VOS Viewer and R-Studio Bibliometrix software tools were used for quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis was carried out by systematic review. The current research trends and gaps in 3DPBE’s were identified through R-Studio Bibliometric analysis and through a systematic review the future directions are proposed as follows: A multi-scale approach to design optimisation in the future of 3D printing which will lead to organic streamlined structures with 3D printed nature-inspired patterns in some cases will open a slew of new possibilities, application of eco-friendly materials, life cycle assessment and cost factors. The main contribution of this study is to synthesise the 3DPBE with nature-inspired geometry and expose the insufficiency of literature in this area. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Bibliometric analysis; Bioinspired; Biomimicry; Building envelope; Systematic review","","","","","","","","Zari M.P., Bioinspired architectural design to adapt to climate change, World Sustainable Building Conference (SB08), pp. 771-778, (2008); Benyus J.M., What is biomimicry?, (1997); Lucuik M., Trusty W., Larsson N., Charette R., A business case for green buildings in Canada, (2005); De Plessis A., Babafemi A.J., Paul S.C., Panda B., Tran J.P., Broeckhoven C., Biomimicry for 3D concrete printing: a review and perspective, Additive Manufacturing, 38, (2021); Sarakinioti M.V., Turrin M., Konstantinou T., Tenpierik M., Knaack U., Developing an integrated 3D-printed façade with complex geometries for active temperature control, Materials Today Communications, 15, pp. 275-279, (2018); Wu P., Wang J., Wang X., A critical review of the use of 3-D printing in the construction industry, Automation in Construction, 68, pp. 21-31, (2016); Johnson R.B., Onwuegbuzie A.J., Mixed methods research: a research paradigm whose time has come, Educational Researcher, 33, 7, pp. 14-26, (2004); Grant M.J., Booth A., A typology of reviews: an analysis of 14 review types and associated methodologies, Health Information and Libraries Journal, 26, 2, pp. 91-108, (2009); Moher D., Liberati A., Tetzlaff J., Altman D.G., Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses: the PRISMA statement, Journal of clinical epidemiology, 62, 10, pp. 1006-1012, (2009); Dervis H., Bibliometric analysis using bibliometrix an R package, Journal of Scientometric Research, 8, 3, pp. 156-160, (2019); Yin X., Liu H., Chen Y., Al-Hussein M., Building information modeling for off-site construction: review and future directions, Automation in Construction, 101, pp. 72-91, (2019); Abdelmageed S., Zayed T., A study of literature in modular integrated construction-Critical review and future directions, Journal of Cleaner Production, 277, (2020); Khan S.A., Koc M., Al-Ghamdi S.G., Sustainability assessment, potentials, and challenges of 3DP concrete structures: a systematic review for built environmental applications, Journal of Cleaner Production, 303, (2021); Mahadevan M., Francis A., Thomas A., A simulation-based investigation of sustainability aspects of 3D printed structures, Journal of Building Engineering, 32, (2020); Mohammad M., Masad E., Al-Ghamdi S.G., 3D concrete printing sustainability: a comparative life cycle assessment of four construction method scenarios, Buildings, 10, 12, pp. 2451-20, (2020); Vazquez E., Randall C., Duarte J.P., Shape-changing architectural skins a review on materials, design and fabrication strategies and performance analysis, Journal of Facade Design and Engineering, 7, 2, pp. 93-114, (2019); Ooms T., Vantyghem G., Coile R.V., De Corte W., A parametric modeling strategy for the numerical simulation of 3D concrete printing with complex geometries, Additive Manufacturing, 38, (2021); Volpe S., Sangiorgio V., Petrella A., Coppola A., Notarnicola M., Fiorito F., Building envelope prefabricated with 3D printing technology, Sustainability, 13, 16, (2021); Sanguinetti P., Almazam K., Humaidan O., Colistra J., Evaluating the potential of high-performance concrete 3D printing for zero energy homes, Building Simulation Conference Proceedings, 7, pp. 5068-5075, (2019); Kuru A., Oldfield P., Bonser S., Fiorito F., Biomimetic adaptive building skins: energy and environmental regulation in buildings, Energy and Buildings, 205, (2019); Jassmi H.A., Najjar F.A., Mourad A.H.I., Large-scale 3D printing: the way forward, IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 324, 1, pp. 012088-15, (2018); Speck O., Speck D., Horn R., Gantner J., Sedlbauer K.P., Biomimetic bio-inspired biomorph sustainable?

This paper demonstrated our preliminary work on the laser powder-bed fusion feedback loop: predict local porosity through in-process monitoring images and machine learning. 3D models were rebuilt from in-situ optical tomography monitoring images and post-build X-ray CT images. They were registered to the original CAD. Dataset for machine learning was assembled from those registered 3D models. The trained machine learning model can precisely predict local porosity caused by lack of fusion and keyhole with multi-layer monitoring images. It also indicates the optimal processing window. It is impossible to be sure about the occurrence of defects in a layer based only on the abnormality of a single layer, and vice versa. Defects in a layer can be caused by improper parameters or anomalies in current layer or subsequent layers; defects in one layer can also be eliminated by proper parameters in the following layers. The work laid the basis for the next step feedback loop control of pore defect. © 2022 The Author(s)","Defects; In-process monitoring; Machine learning; Powder bed fusion","Computerized tomography; Feedback; Forecasting; Image fusion; Machine learning; Porosity; Process control; Process monitoring; 3D models; 3d-modeling; Feedback loops; In-process monitoring; Laser powders; Local porosity; Loop control; Machine-learning; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion; Defects","","","","","Centre for Additive Manufacture–Metal; European Union's Horizon2020 research and innovation program; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (820774); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; VINNOVA","This research was performed within the project Additive Manufacturing using Metal Pilot Line (MANUELA), which received funding from the European Union's Horizon2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 820774.

Therefore, appropriate heat input management to alleviate heat accumulation is critical for metal AM processes. In order to mitigate heat accumulation and achieve better geometric accuracy, this work develops an innovative 3D numerical model-based deposition strategy to regulate the heat input for the metal AM process. Specifically, the proposed deposition strategy involves two steps: (i) a thermal simulation of the deposition process via an intelligent heat source tracking algorithm, thereby outputting a series of heat source data to ensure a constant molten pool size of the 3D model, and (ii) the output heat source data are utilized to regulate the heat input point-by-point of the deposit in the subsequent AM process. The proposed deposition strategy is demonstrated for plasma arc-based additive manufacturing (PA-AM) of a 20-layer Inconel 625 thin-walled deposit. The surface quality is measured with a profiler and the deviation of the deposits in the building direction is calculated by image processing techniques. The results show that the proposed deposition strategy is superior in geometric accuracy compared with the conventional approaches (i.e., the introduction of interlayer dwell time) from the perspectives of the forming height, surface morphology, and vertical deviation in the building direction. Meanwhile, benefitting from progressive forming and thermal management, PA-AM through the proposed approach can significantly reduce the total deposition time and energy consumption. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Heat input regulation; Heat source tracking; Numerical model; Plasma arc","3D modeling; Additives; Deposits; Energy utilization; Image processing; Morphology; Numerical models; Surface morphology; Thin walled structures; Three dimensional computer graphics; Additive manufacturing process; Heat accumulation; Heat input; Heat input regulation; Heat source tracking; Heat sources; Metal additives; Model-based OPC; Plasma arc; Source tracking; 3D printers","","","","","","","Bikas H., Stavropoulos P., Chryssolouris G., Additive manufacturing methods and modeling approaches: a critical review, Int.

This leaves a crucial gap in understanding between material structure and bulk mechanical properties. Our objective was to fabricate a mechanical testing device small enough to fit in most upright or inverted microscopy stages and able to position samples to allow for simultaneous mechanical and microstructural characterization. Parts were 3D printed using the hobbyist-friendly Fused Filament Fabrication technique, then assembled with commercial fasteners and translation components to create a mechanical testing device that utilized the deflection of plastic posts to determine sample reaction forces under applied strain. Video of sample deformation was analyzed using a custom processing script to calculate stress and strain behavior in an automated and high-throughput manner. This device was able to perform mechanical characterization with an accuracy comparable to commercial mechanical testing devices for a wide range of nonlinear and viscoelastic samples under dry and hydrated conditions. Additionally, the device showed compatibility with different upright and inverted microscopes and was able to demonstrate accurate mechanical testing results when used with these instruments. We successfully developed a device capable of accurately testing a majority of soft materials in the field of Biomedical Engineering with the ability to perform additional microstructural characterization using microscopy at a price point of $600. © 2021, The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc.","3D printing; Low-cost; Mechanical testing; Microscopy; Microstructure; Modulus","3D printers; Ability testing; Biomedical engineering; Costs; Fabrication; Instrument testing; Mechanical testing; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Low-costs; Material bulk; Materials structure; Mechanical characterizations; Microstructural characterizations; Modulus; Testing device; Under loads; Microstructure","","","","","Gulf Coast Consortia","This work was supported in part by the John S.

The technology of selective laser melting is one of the key technologies in Industry 4.0, which allows manufacturing products of any complex geometric shape, reducing significantly the amount of material used, reducing the lead time and obtaining a new alloy from elementary powders in the melting process. To understand the process of alloy formation under laser exposure, it is necessary to know the initial data of powders, which significantly affect the quality of the products obtained. The purpose of this study is to determine the requirements for the structural-phase state, elemental composition of aluminum, silicon and magnesium powders and further preparation of Al-Si-Mg (Al — 91 wt.%, Si — 8 wt.%, Mg — 1 wt.%) powder mixture for laser synthesis. The initial powders of aluminum PA-4 (GOST 6058-73), silicon (GOST 2169-69) and magnesium MPF-4 (GOST 6001-79) and powder composition Al-Si-Mg are studied using X-ray diffraction and X-ray phase analysis. The shape and sizes of particles are determined by the studies of raster electronic images. By the method of selective laser melting, samples are obtained from a powder composition under constant and pulsed laser exposure. The composition is prepared by mixing powders in a globe mill. Results and discussion. It is shown that the initial powders of aluminum, silicon and magnesium are single-phase. Particles with a size of 20–64 µm, recommended for selective laser melting, are used to obtain a powder composition. By mixing the powders for one hour, spherical particles are obtained, which is preferable for laser melting. The results of grinding the samples after laser melting showed that the samples obtained under constant laser exposure at the following mode parameters: P = 80 W, V = 300 mm/s, s = = 90 μm, h = 25 μm have the greatest mechanical strength. Conclusions. The described study shows the possibility of synthesizing products from a powder composition of aluminum, silicon and magnesium by selective laser melting. © 2022 The Authors.

After orthogonal experiments, it was verified that a wide SLM processing parameter window can be used to produce crack-free samples for the investigated HEAs. All the printed HEA samples exhibit good densification higher than 98.3%. It was found that obvious epitaxial growth leads to the formation of the cylindrical and equiaxed ordered face-centered cubic (FCC) crystals, displaying the characteristics of sub-cylindrical and sub-cellular microstructures. The low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) prefer appearing around subgrain structures, while the high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) tend to form around coarse grains. Two HEA samples with high and low apparent densities were selected to observe their mechanical properties, which exhibit Vickers hardness higher than 263 HV and do not fail during compression. With increasing densification, the strength gradually rises. According to the engineering stress–strain curves during compression, the yield strength is higher than 530 MPa, while the strength near 40% engineering strain is larger than 1840 MPa. During deformation, a large density of dislocations becomes popular within subgrain structures together with the pre-existing dislocations from rapid solidification, leading to the formation of planar and cross slip bands. Within coarse cylindrical crystals, some deformation twins are also induced together with the appearance of a distinct copper-type texture during deformation. As a result, the as-printed samples display better mechanical properties than the as-cast counterpart. The present studies provide a very good HEA candidate for the SLM process, but more work should be conducted to achieve excellent comprehensive properties. © 2022, The Chinese Society for Metals (CSM) and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","High-entropy alloys; Mechanical properties; Microstructures; Selective laser melting","Aluminum alloys; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Compressive strength; Entropy; Fabrication; Grain boundaries; High strength alloys; High-entropy alloys; Iron alloys; Melting; Selective laser melting; Textures; Twinning; Vickers hardness; Densifications; High entropy alloys; High-strength; Mechanical behavior; Melting techniques; Microstructural features; Orthogonal experiment; Processing parameters; Selective laser melting; Subgrain structures; Deformation","","","","","Free Exploring Basic Research Project of Shenzhen Virtual University Park, (2021Szvup069); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51871132, 51971120); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Beijing Institute of Technology, BIT, (KFJJ21-08M); Beijing Institute of Technology, BIT; Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, (JCYJ20210324121011031); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality; State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, SKLEST","The authors are grateful to K.L.

This study presents the route followed to design a novel Al-Fe-Zr alloy offering good processability, superior yield strength (310 MPa) and thermal conductivity (180 W/m·K) after direct ageing (400°C/4h). The multi-scale characterization, combining scanning and transmission electron microscopy with automated crystallographic orientation mapping and energy dispersive spectroscopy, reveals the precipitation of plate-like Al13Fe4 and coherent Al3Zr-L12 nanoprecipitates upon ageing, enhancing the material's strength. In turn, the associated solid solution depletion results in a significant conductivity increase. The strategy to select low vapour pressure elements and slow diffusers in Al, as well as the low solubility of Fe in Al demonstrates the ability through alloy design for additive manufacturing to fill gaps in the material property space. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Alloy design; Aluminium alloys; Electrical conductivity; Laser powder bed fusion; Mechanical performance","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Economic and social effects; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; High strength alloys; Iron alloys; Precipitation (chemical); Scanning electron microscopy; Ternary alloys; Zircaloy; Alloy designs; Aluminum alloy design; Design strategies; Electrical conductivity; High-strength; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Mechanical performance; Powder bed; Trade off; 3D printers","","","","","Région Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes","This work has been conducted in the framework of the Aéroprint project supported by La Région Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes.

This paper aims to experimentally investigate the influence of dimension, building position, and orientation on the mechanical properties of Ti6Al4V trusses, manufactured by electron beam melting process, to be used in lattice cells. Specimens were manufactured considering the following parameters: truss diameter (1, 1.5, 2 mm), growth orientation (0°, 45°, 90°), and specimen position inside the building chamber. Trusses with diameter of 1 mm showed inconsistent mechanical properties caused by the poor manufacturing quality. Specimen position was found to influence the analyzed mechanical properties. Unmelted powders were observed to affect the outer surfaces of all specimens and the whole cross-sections of specimens manufactured at 0°. Specimens manufactured at 45° with diameter of 2 mm demonstrated the best performances, whereas specimens manufactured at 90° with diameter of 2 mm displayed the highest elongation at fracture. © 2022, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; Electron beam melting; Lattice structures; Mechanical properties; Ti6Al4V","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Electron beam melting; Electron beams; Ternary alloys; Trusses; Vanadium alloys; Additive manufacturing technology; Building chambers; Electron-beam melting; Growth orientations; Lattice cells; Lattice structures; Manufacturing quality; Melting process; Position and orientations; Specimen position; Titanium alloys","","","","","Università degli Studi di Salerno, UNISA","Open access funding provided by Università degli Studi di Salerno within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.

The optimum parameters of P = 170 W, V = 0.8 m/s were determined, under which the SLMed samples exhibited both the largest relative density of 99.57% and the best mechanical properties, including the microhardness (329.3 ± 3.8 HV), yield strength (726 ± 8.1 MPa), ultimate tensile strength (900 ± 5.9 MPa) and elongation ((31.9 ± 0.24)%). The average grain size ranges of SLMed samples are from 15.2 to 17.4 μm, with a typical mixed grain structure. Owing to the high cooling rate and remelting during SLM process, a large number of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs), dislocations and sub-grains were formed, and the fraction of LAGBs reached above 65%. At the same time, the content of low-Σ coincidence site lattice (CSL) boundaries was mostly less than 1%, while there was almost no γ′ phase precipitated in the matrix. The texture of SLMed samples was weak, and there was no obvious preferred growth direction. Combining with the microstructure characterization, both grain refinement strengthening and dislocation strengthening were considered as the main strengthening mechanisms. Moreover, the fracture mechanism of the optimum sample belonged to ductile fracture. © 2022, The Chinese Society for Metals (CSM) and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Mechanical property; Microstructure; Ni-based superalloy; Relative density; Selective laser melting","Crystal lattices; Density (specific gravity); Ductile fracture; Grain boundaries; Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; Melting; Selective laser melting; Superalloys; Tensile strength; Textures; Laser melting process; Low angle grain boundaries; Microstructure and properties; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Ni-based superalloys; Optimum parameters; Process parameters; Relative density; Selective laser melting; Ultimate tensile strength; Nickel alloys","","","","","Deep Coal Mining Equipment; Project of Shandong Province Higher Educational Young Innovative Talent Introduction and Cultivation Team; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52175297)","This work was financially supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (No. 52175297) and the Project of Shandong Province Higher Educational Young Innovative Talent Introduction and Cultivation Team (Performance Enhancement of Deep Coal Mining Equipment).

Statistical analysis of the scatter in fatigue using statistical derived safety factors concludes that at a stress of 36.87 MPa the fatigue limit of 107 cycles could be reached for all specimen with a survival probability of 99.999 %.  © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston, Germany.","Additive manufacturing; Aluminum alloy; Defects; Fatigue properties; Fractography; MGA Mobility goes Additive; PBF-LB/M; Reliability; Reproducibility","3D printers; Aluminum alloys; Fatigue crack propagation; Microstructure; Porosity; Safety factor; Fatigue properties; Laser powders; MGA mobility go additive; PBF-LB/M; Powder bed; Powder quality; Quality process; Reproducibilities; Round Robin; Round Robin test; Additives","","","","","","","Aboulkhair N.T., Everitt N.M., Ashcroft I., Tuck C., Additive Manufacturing, 1, pp. 1-4, (2014); Arun K., Aravindh K., Raja K., Naiju C.D., Thrinadh E., Ranka S., SAE Technical Paper, (2018); Binder M., Fischer M., Dietrich S., Seidel C., Reinhart G., SSRN Journal, (2020); Binder M., Dirnhofer C., Kindermann P., Horn M., Schmitt M., Anstaett C., Schlick G., Seidel C., Reinhart G., Procedia CIRP, 93, pp. 1304-1309, (2020); Verein Deutscher Ingenieure E.V., VDI 3405 Blatt 2.1 Laser-Strahlschmelzen Metallischer Bauteile Materialkenndatenblatt Aluminiumlegierung AlSi10Mg, (2015); Materialdatenblatt EOS Aluminium AlSi10Mg, EOS, (2014); Material Data Sheet AL-Alloy AlSi10Mg; Li W., Li S., Liu J., Zhang A., Zhou Y., Wei Q., Yan C., Shi Y., Materials Science and Engineering A, 663, pp. 116-125, (2016); Kempf A., Hilgenberg K., Materials Science and Engineering A, 776, (2020); Kempf A., Hilgenberg K., Materials Science and Engineering A, 818, (2021); Fischer C., Schweizer C., Augenstein E., Gießereipraxis, 9, pp. 40-48, (2018); Brandao A.D., Gumpinger J., Gschweitl M., Seyfert C., Hofbauer P., Ghidini T., Procedia Structural Integrity, 7, pp. 58-66, (2017); Xu Z.W., Wang Q., Wang X.S., Tan C.H., Guo M.H., Gao P.B., Mechanics of Materials, 148, (2020); Ed, (2021); Kass B., Maassen R., Schneider D.M., 37.

AFSD presents numerous benefits over other forms of fusion-based additive manufacturing, such as high-strength mechanical bonding, joining of dissimilar alloys, and high deposition rates. To improve, automate, and ensure the quality, uniformity, and consistency of the AFSD process, it is necessary to control the temperature at the interaction zone and the force applied to the consumable feedstock during deposition. In this paper, real-time temperature and force feedback are achieved by embedding thermocouples into the nonconsumable machine tool-shoulder and estimating the applied force from the motor current of the linear actuator driving the feedstock. Subsequently, temperature and force controllers are developed for the AFSD process, ensuring that the temperature at the interaction zone and the force applied to the feedstock track desired command values. The temperature and force controllers were evaluated separately and together on setpoints and time-varying trajectories. For combined temperature and force control with setpoints selected at a temperature of 420 °C and a force of 2669 N, the average temperature and force tracking errors are 5.4 ± 6.5 °C (1.4 ± 1.6%) and 140.1 ± 213.5 N (5.2 ± 8.0%), respectively. © 2022 by the authors.","Additive Friction Stir Deposition (AFSD); closed-loop control; force control; temperature control","","","","","","Engineer Research and Development Center, ERDC; University of Alabama, UA","The research described and the resulting data presented herein, unless otherwise noted, were funded under PE 0603119A, Project BO3 “Ground Advanced Technology/Military Engineering Technology Demonstration”, Task SB0328 under Contract W912HZ1990001, Agreement W912HZ209F0004 managed by the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center.

In-situ sensing has been proposed for monitoring the AM process to minimize defects, but successful minimization requires establishing a quantitative relationship between the sensing data and the porosity, which is particularly challenging with a large number of variables (e.g., laser speed, power, scan path, powder property). Physics-based modeling can simulate such an in-situ sensing-porosity relationship, but it is computationally costly. In this work, we develop Machine Learning (ML) models that can use in-situ thermographic data to predict the micropore of LPBF stainless steel materials. This work considers two identified key features from the thermal histories: the time above the apparent melting threshold (τ) and the maximum radiance (Tmax). These features are computed, stored for each voxel in the built material, and then used as inputs. The binary state of each voxel, either defective or normal, is the output. Different ML models are trained and tested for the binary classification task. In addition to using the thermal features of each voxel to predict its own state, the thermal features of neighboring voxels are also included as inputs. This is shown to improve the prediction accuracy, which is consistent with thermal transport physics around each voxel contributing to its final state. Among the models trained, the F1 scores on test sets reach above 0.96 for Random Forests. Feature importance analysis based on the ML models shows that Tmax is more important to the voxel state than τ. The analysis also finds that the thermal history of the voxels above the present voxel is more influential than those beneath it. Our study significantly extends the capability of using in-situ thermographic data to predict porosity in LPBF materials. Since ML models are fast, they may play integral roles in the optimization and control of such AM technologies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Binary classification; Confusion matrix; LPBF; Machine learning","Additives; Decision trees; Defects; Forecasting; Infrared imaging; Machine learning; Microporosity; Random forests; Tensile strength; Binary classification; Confusion matrix; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Micropores; Powder bed; Thermal features; Thermal history; 3D printers","","","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; University of Notre Dame, ND; Honeywell Federal Manufacturing and Technologies, FM&T, (DE-NA0002839); Honeywell Federal Manufacturing and Technologies, FM&T; Center for Research Computing, University of Pittsburgh, Pitt CRC","The authors are grateful for the data provided by Honeywell Federal Manufacturing and Technologies and obtained during work funded by Contract No. DE-NA0002839 with the U.S. Department of Energy .

However, little is known about the abdominal segments. Mantis shrimps, a group of crustaceans, evolved abdominal segments that are mechanically robust. Here, we conduct a systematic study of the three-dimensional geometry, material composition, nanoindentation mechanical properties, and microstructural features of mantis shrimp abdominal segments. Inspired by the helicoidally distributed fiber hollow tubes of abdominal segment, a mechanically efficient helicoidal structure is designed and fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). The LPBF processed helicoidal structure achieves high forming accuracy (peak deviation = 7.5 μm) and relative density (99.78%). Furthermore, using a combination of compression experiments and finite element simulations, we show that the helicoidal structure exhibits superior specific energy absorption (2.4 times) and plateau stress (2.7 times) to the conventional honeycomb structure and tube structure. The structural optimization results show that the rotation angle and the number of layers have a significant effect on the mechanical properties and the helicoidal structure with a rotation angle of 45° and 3 layers has the best comprehensive energy absorption performance. We demonstrate that the mechanism for this improvement in mechanical properties is the unique twisting stress conduction path of the helicoidal structure under compression. Our results reveal that bio-inspired additive manufacturing paves the way to develop high-performance structures which are in great demand in modern industrial applications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing;

The objective of this study was to reconstruct the prior β grains of heat-treated LPBF Ti-6Al-4V alloy using crystallography data of α grains from electron backscatter diffraction. The reconstruction shows that the orientation relationship in β to α transformation is close to the Burgers orientation relationship but not rational. Besides, the results clearly confirm the orientation inheritance between the reversed β phase and the prior β phase. An accidental finding is that the α boundaries, having with misorientation ranges of 15°–56° and 67°–88°, are nearly identical to the high-angle grain boundaries of prior β phase.

However, it is unclear how nanoparticles affect the printing process and the extent of the effect. Numerical simulation can realize such a quantitative study. Here, we developed a method to quantify the effects of nano-particles on the printability in laser powder bed fusion with multiple physics simulation model, with the consideration of surface tension, Marangoni effect, phase transition and recoil force via volume of fluid method. The influence of nanoparticles as well as thermal properties on the molten pool morphology, temperature distribution and cooling rate were studied. The results showed that TiB2/AlSi10Mg possessed higher cooling rate and larger melt pool depth, which is consistent with single track experimental result. The G-R solidification map indicated that for the specific points in the mush zone, percentages of them in equiaxed, mixed and columnar region for TiB2/ AlSi10Mg are 14.29%, 76.19% and 9.52%, respectively, revealing that TiB2 can lead to the transition from the columnar region to the equiaxed one, which was also confirmed by the experimental EBSD map. The study on thermophysical properties indicated that thermal conductivity had the largest influence on the characteristic of molten pool, which can be used as a strategy to optimize the quality in practical application. By introducing the printability factor F, we determined that the printability of AlSi10Mg and different particles decorated AlSi10Mg is in the following order: TiB2/AlSi10Mg > TiC/AlSi10Mg > SiC/AlSi10Mg > AlSi10Mg. This work provides a theoretical framework to predict the printability and efficiently screen for promising metal materials with good printability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Laser powder bed fusion; Melt pool dynamics; Nano particles; Printability; Simulation","Aluminum alloys; Aluminum compounds; Cooling; Magnesium compounds; Metal nanoparticles; Morphology; Powder metals; Silicon; Silicon carbide; Thermal conductivity; Titanium carbide; Comprehensive modeling; Fine microstructure; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Melt pool dynamics; Microstructure mechanical properties; Nanoparti-cles; Powder bed; Printability; Simulation; Textures","","","","","Shanghai Sailing Program, (20YF1419200); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai, (20ZR1427500); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52004160, 52075327); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Science and Technology Major Project of Guangxi, (Z2020001); Science and Technology Major Project of Guangxi","This work is sponsored by National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 52075327 and 52004160 ), Shanghai Sailing Program ( 20YF1419200 ), Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai ( 20ZR1427500 ) and Major Science and Technology Project of Huaibei ( Z2020001 ).

The bioink used for 3D bioprinting consists of biological materials and cells. Because of the dominant gravitational force, the suspended cells in the bioink sediment resulting in the accumulation and aggregation of cells. This study primarily focuses on the quantification of cell sedimentation-induced cell aggregation during and after inkjet-based bioprinting. The major conclusions are summarized as follows: (1) as the printing time increases from 0 min to 60 min, the percentage of the cells forming cell aggregates at the bottom of the bioink reservoir increases significantly from 3.6% to 54.5%, indicating a severe cell aggregation challenge in 3D bioprinting, (2) during inkjet-based bioprinting, at the printing time of only 15 min, more than 80% of the cells within the nozzle have formed cell aggregates. Both the individual cells and cell aggregates tend to migrate to the vicinity of the nozzle centerline mainly due to the weak shear-thinning properties of the bioink, and (3) after the bioprinting process, the mean cell number per microsphere increases significantly from 0.38 to 1.05 as printing time increases from 0 min to 15 min. The maximum number of cells encapsulated within one microsphere is ten, and 29.8% of the microspheres with cells encapsulated have contained small or large cell aggregates at the printing time of 15 min.

Of particular interest is the study of complex geometries production, such as lattice structures, which may have a potentially huge field of application, especially for biomedical products. In this work, the powder bed fusion technique was utilized to manufacture lattice structures with defined building angles concerning the build platform. A biocompatible Co-Cr-Mo alloy was used. Three different types of elementary cell geometry were selected: Face Centered Cubic, Diagonal, and Diamond. These cells were applied to the radially oriented lattice structures to evaluate the influence of their orientation in relation to the sample and the build platform. Moreover, heat treatment was carried out to study its influence on microstructural properties and mechanical behavior. Microhardness was measured, and compressive tests were performed to detect load response and to analyse the fracture mechanisms of these structures. The results show that the mechanical properties are highly influenced by the cell orientation in relation to the building direction and that the properties can be further tuned via HT. The favorable combination of mechanical properties and biocompatibility suggests that Co-Cr-Mo lattices may represent an optimal solution to produce customized metal implants. © 2022, Gruppo Italiano Frattura.

However, very limited efforts have been taken to realise pressure sensors fully using additive manufacturing techniques, especially for personalised guide prosthetics in biomedical applications. In this work, we present a novel, fully printed piezoresistive pressure sensor, which was realised by using Aerosol Jet® Printing (AJP) and Screen Printing. AJ®P was specifically chosen to print silver interconnects on a selective laser sintered (SLS) polyamide board as a customised substrate, while piezoresistive electrodes were manually screen-printed on the top of the interconnects as the sensing layer. The sensor was electromechanically tested, and its response was registered upon the application of given signals, in terms of sensitivity, hysteresis, reproducibility, and time drift. When applying a ramping pressure, the sensor showed two different sensitive regions: (i) a highly sensitive region in the range of 0 to 0.12 MPa with an average sensitivity of 106 Ω/MPa and a low sensitive zone within 0.12 to 1.25 MPa with an average sensitivity of 7.6 Ω/MPa with some indeterminate overlapping regions. Hysteresis was negligible and an electrical resistance deviation of about 14% was observed in time drift experiments. Such performances will satisfy the demands of our application in the biomedical field as a smart prosthetics guide. © 2022 by the authors.","Aerosol Jet<sup>®</sup> Printing; biomedical pressure sensor; screen printing; selective laser sintering","Aerosols; Nylons; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Reproducibility of Results; Silver; 3D printers; Aerosols; Hysteresis; Laser heating; Medical applications; Pressure sensors; Prosthetics; Sintering; nylon; silver; Aerosol jet printings; Average sensitivities; Biomedical pressure sensor; Hybrid printing; Manufacturing techniques; Pressure sensing; Printed electronics; Sensitive regions; Time drift; Transduction mechanism; aerosol; reproducibility; three dimensional printing; Screen printing","","silver, 7440-22-4; Aerosols, ; Nylons, ; Silver, ","","","TETRA 3D ElektroPrint; Agentschap Innoveren en Ondernemen, VLAIO","This research was funded by VLAIO, as a part of the Project: TETRA 3D ElektroPrint, -3D printen van vrije vorm elektrische/elektronische toepasssingen -HBC.2016.0067.","Cheng M., Zhu G., Zhang F., Tang W., Jianping S., Yang J., Zhu L., An review of flexible force sensors for human health monitoring, J.

If lightweighting is one of the main strengths of L-PBF, a weakness is still the trade-off between high mechanical properties and competitive productivity. This objective can be targeted through a fine tuning of the process parameters within the manufacturing window. The paper pursues the combined optimization of part quality and process productivity for AlSi10Mg by going beyond the commonly used approach based solely on volumetric energy density. The effects of hatch distance and scan speed on the two targets were analyzed in detail. The best results were achieved by the adoption of a high scan speed and a low hatch distance, with notably different outcomes for nearly the same energy density. © 2022 by the authors.","AlSi10Mg; laser powder bed fusion; process parameters; productivity","","","","","","","","Standard Terminology for Additive Manufacturing Technologies, (2013); Bassoli E., Defanti S., Tognoli E., Vincenzi N., Degli Esposti L., Design for Additive Manufacturing and for Machining in the Automotive Field, Appl.

Moreover, the maturity of the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) technology and the associated low costs has allowed creative solutions to be produced and used in real-life applications. A distinctive example is represented by the common action of opening a door. Since hands are a typical vector of contamination for viruses such as Coronavirus, hands-free devices aim at making use of the existing structure and kinematic to complete the same action in a different fashion. Typically, the mechanical and manufacturing requirements of these devices include a suitable stiffness-to-mass ratio, a reduced printing time as well as the minimization of supports which need to be removed in a post-printing phase. To tackle all these requirements a dedicated topology optimization (TO) method can be used since the preliminary design phase. Several design requirements of different nature can be included in the problem formulation: mechanical ones, like mass and stiffness, and manufacturing ones, like drawing direction or minimum member size. In this paper, a feasibility study on a hands-free 3D printed door opener has been carried out by means of the Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) method for TO and its CAD-compatible variant, i.e., the SIMP approach reformulated in the framework of non-uniform rational basis spline hyper-surfaces. The aim of the study is to identify optimal solutions to be adapted to a real-case scenario wherein different loading cases and manufacturing constraints are evaluated. Different optimal solutions are obtained, reconstructed to be compatible with CAD environment and the optimized geometry numerically assessed. Finally, the optimal solutions are also evaluated with respect to indicators such as printing time, total filament mass and mass of the supports required by the printing process. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; COVID; Density-based method; Manufacturing constraints; NURBS Hyper-surfaces; Topology optimization","","","","","","Conception et Optimisation de Forme pour la Fabrication Additive; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR, (ANR-17-CE10-0008)","G.

Also, the energy density is insufficient to detect the process window for producing full dense components. In fact, parts produced with the same energy density but different combinations of parameters may present different properties even under the microstructural viewpoint. In this context, the need to assess the influence of the process parameters and to select the best parameters set able to optimize the final properties of SLM parts has been capturing the attention of both academics and practitioners. In this paper different hybrid prediction-optimization approaches for maximizing the relative density of Ti6Al4V SLM manufactured parts are proposed. An extended design of experiments involving six process parameters has been configured for constructing two surrogate models based on response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN), respectively. The optimization phase has been performed by means of evolutionary computations. To this end, three nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms have been integrated with the prediction modelling structures. A series of experimental tests has been carried out to validate the results from the proposed hybrid optimization procedures. Also, a sensitivity analysis based on the results from the analysis of variance was executed to evaluate the influence of the processing parameter and their reciprocal interactions on the part porosity. © 2022, The Author(s).","Artificial neural network; Metaheuristic algorithms; Optimization; Predictive model; Response surface methodology","Aluminum alloys; Biomimetics; Design of experiments; Forecasting; Melting; Optimization; Selective laser melting; Sensitivity analysis; Surface properties; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Energy density; Hybrid predictions; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Optimisations; Optimization approach; Predictive models; Processing parameters; Property; Response-surface methodology; Selective laser melting; Neural networks","","","","","","","Blanco A., Delgado M., Pegalajar M.C., A real-coded genetic algorithm for training recurrent neural networks, Neural Networks, 14, 1, pp. 93-105, (2001); Costa A., Fichera S., Economic statistical design of ARMA control chart through a modified fitnessbased selfadaptive differential evolution, Computers & Industrial Engineering, 105, pp. 174-189, (2017); Artificial Neural Networks for Intelligent Manufacturing, (2012); DebRoy T., Wei H.L., Zuback J.S., Mukherjee T., Elmer J.W., Milewski J.O., Beese A.M., Wilson-Heid A.D., De A., Zhang W., Additive manufacturing of metallic components–process, structure and properties, Progress in Materials Science, 92, pp. 112-224, (2018); Deep K., Thakur M., A new mutation operator for real coded genetic algorithms, Applied Mathematics and Computation, 193, 1, pp. 211-230, (2007); Deshwal S., Kumar A., Chhabra D., Exercising hybrid statistical tools GA-RSM, GA-ANN and GA-ANFIS to optimize FDM process parameters for tensile strength improvement, CIRP Journal of Manufacturing Science and Technology, 31, pp. 189-199, (2020); Deswal S., Narang R., Chhabra D., Modeling and parametric optimization of FDM 3D printing process using hybrid techniques for enhancing dimensional preciseness, International Journal on Interactive Design and Manufacturing (IJIDeM), 13, 3, pp. 1197-1214, (2019); Du K.L., Swamy M.N., Neural networks and statistical learning, (2013); Eberhart R., Kennedy J., Particle swarm optimization, In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks, 4, pp. 1942-1948, (1995); Eberhart R.C., Shi Y., Tracking and optimizing dynamic systems with particle swarms, In Proceedings of the 2001 Congress on Evolutionary Computation (IEEE Cat.

Previous work on selective laser sintering with nanosecond lasers has been reported, particularly for laser micro sintering. At a sufficiently high intensity, a nanosecond (ns) laser pulse can generate a plasma plume from its irradiated metallic powder bed surface. The plasma plume evolution, such as the pressure it generates on the surface of the powder bed, may significantly influence the sintering process in the powder bed. However, physics-based modeling work for plasma generated by nanosecond-pulsed laser interaction with a metallic micro powder bed has been seldomly seen in literatures according to the knowledge of the authors’. Such modeling work has been reported in this paper for a ~4-ns laser pulse interaction with a cobalt micro powder bed, integrated with time-resolved plasma imaging using an intensified CCD (ICCD) camera with nanosecond scale gate widths for the model validation. For the conditions investigated, the model-predicted plasma plume evolutions agree reasonably well with the ICCD imaging results for the given period of comparison. This has reasonably supported the hypothesis posed in this paper (which has been rarely tested according to the knowledge of the authors’) that a short ns laser pulse-induced plasma from a metallic micro powder bed below the critical temperature can be reasonably well described by solving gas dynamic equations in the gaseous phase together with solving the heat transfer equation in the powder bed condensed phase, where the coupling is via the Knudsen layer (KL) relations for vaporization at the interface between the two phases. The model calculations show that in comparison with the bulk cobalt situation, the ns laser pulse can induce more significant surface vaporization from the cobalt powder bed, leading to a plasma plume with typically higher peak temperatures and densities in the simulated period. The plume can generate a short total pressure pulse with a ~491-MPa peak magnitude on the surface of the powder bed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Laser micro sintering; Selective laser melting; Selective laser sintering","Cobalt; Heat affected zone; Heat flux; Heat transfer; Laser heating; Laser pulses; Pulsed lasers; Selective laser melting; Sintering; Laser interaction; Laser micro sintering; Metallic powder; Metallics; Micropowders; Nanosecond laser pulse; Nanosecond lasers; Plasmas plumes; Powder bed; Selective laser melting; Melting","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CMMI 1728481); National Science Foundation, NSF; Purdue University, PU; Purdue Research Foundation, (16/427,638, 62693684); Purdue Research Foundation","Funding text 1: This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. CMMI 1728481.

The subject of this research was to determine how parameters such as compressive load direction and the shape of the 3D-printed specimens affect elastic modulus measurements for four different polylactic acid (PLA) filaments. The methods of measurement of compressive Young’s modulus of FDM 3D prints are not yet clearly standardized, although their values are important in creating accurate numerical models of the strength AM products. In this paper, the authors prepared four sets of specimens. Each set consisted of five sample triplets—one with circular, one with triangular and three with square cross sections to perform tri-directional quasistatic compression trials. Based on the results, it was concluded that the shape of the specimens did not affect elastic modulus values for sets made of the same material. However way the direction of the load applied caused test results to vary differently for different types of PLA material. © 2022, ASM International.","3D printing; compressive strength; elastic modulus; FDM; Young modulus","Compressive strength; Deposition; Frequency division multiplexing; Fused Deposition Modeling; Layered manufacturing; Numerical methods; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Compressive loads; Cross section shape; Elastic moduli measurement; Load direction; Mechanical behavior; Model method; Polymeric products; Young modulus; Elastic moduli","","","","","","","3D Printing Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report by Component, by Printer Type (Desktop, Industrial), by Technology, by Software, by Application, by Vertical, by Material, by Region, and Segment Forecasts, pp. 2021-2028, (2021); Hull C.W., Apparatus for Production of Three-Dmensonal Objects by Stereo Thography, (1984); Shahrubudin N., Lee T.C., Ramlan R., An Overview on 3D Printing Technology: Technological, Materials, and Applications, Procedia Manuf., 35, pp. 1286-1296, (2019); Torrado A.R., Roberson D.A., Failure Analysis and Anisotropy Evaluation of 3D-Printed Tensile Test Specimens of Different Geometries and Print Raster Patterns, J.

In this paper, the multi-material structure of Ti6Al4V/AlSi10Mg is fabricated by LPBF, the interfacial characterization, interfacial reaction mechanism and mechanical properties of Ti/Al structure are investigated. Results show that continuous and excellent metallurgical bonding between Ti6Al4V and AlSi10Mg is obtained, and the width of interface zone is about 100 μm. The equiaxed grains of aluminum alloy at the interface show random crystallographic orientation, which is attributed to the thermal dynamics in the melt pool, thermal cycles during LPBF process and lower thermal conductivity of titanium alloy. The interfacial reaction layers are orderly from titanium alloy to the aluminum alloy consisting of Ti3Al, TiAl with nanoparticles Ti5Si3 and rod-like TiAl3. The segregated Si atoms react with the dissolution of Ti atoms in-situ to form Ti5Si3, meanwhile, a mass of Al atoms also react with Ti atoms to form TiAl. Namely, the TiAl phase forms in thin layer shape embedded with nanoparticles Ti5Si3 through eutectic reaction near the fusion line at the interface. At the wall of eutectic production, the TiAl3 phase nucleation and grow opposite to the heat dissipation direction and vertical to the fusion line. Outside the fusion line, the supersaturated solid α-Ti transforms to Ti3Al through the diffusion of Al atoms in the part of titanium alloy. During the interfacial reaction, in-situ generated nanoparticles Ti5Si3 could improve the joint strength, and the tensile strength of Ti6Al4V/AlSi10Mg specimens reached 264.8 ± 22.4 MPa. The tensile specimens exhibit brittle fracture and two typical fracture morphologies appear on the fracture surface. © 2022","Interfacial characterization; Interfacial reaction mechanism; LPBF; Mechanical properties; Ti/Al multi-material structure","Aluminum alloys; Atoms; Binary alloys; Eutectics; Fracture; Magnesium alloys; Manufacture; Molecular dynamics; Nanoparticles; Silicon; Tensile strength; Textures; Thermal conductivity; Fusion process; Interfacial characterization; Interfacial reaction mechanism; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Multi-material structure; Powder bed; Reaction mechanism; Ti/al multi-material structure; Titanium (alloys); Titanium alloys","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51975016); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST, (2018YFE0197100); Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST; Beijing University of Technology, BJUT","This work is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 51975016 ), Key R & D Projects of Ministry of Science and Technology (Project No. 2018YFE0197100 ) and 2021 international scientific research cooperation talent introduction and cultivation project of BJUT.","Onuike B., Bandyopadhyay A., Bond strength measurement for additively manufactured Inconel 718- GRCop84 copper alloy bimetallic joints, Addit.

Two common post-build heat treatments were applied to produce two distinct microstructures, one which retained much of the solidification structure from additive manufacturing, while the other was mostly recrystallized. For both groups, residual stresses were assessed along the crack path by neutron diffraction. At low load ratios (R = 0.1), the non-recrystallized LPBF material had the lowest and most varied fatigue crack growth thresholds at 6–7.2 MPa m1/2. This is attributed to a reduction in crack path roughness induced crack closure and high superimposed residual stresses. The recrystallizing heat treatment coarsened and homogenized the grain structure substantially, thus increasing the threshold to 7.3–7.6 MPa m1/2 due to a substantially rougher crack path and completely relieved residual stresses. Both LPBF heat treatments showed negligible effect of build orientation and gave significantly lower fatigue thresholds compared to wrought material tested in the L-T orientation (∼11 MPa m1/2). At high load ratios, the difference in fatigue behavior between microstructures was reduced but still present and was attributed to differences in geometric shielding from crack path roughness, grain size, and degree of microstructural homogeneity. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Alloy 718; Fatigue crack growth; Fatigue threshold; Heat treatment; Laser powder bed fusion; Superalloys","3D printers; Additives; Crystal microstructure; Grain size and shape; Neutron diffraction; Nickel alloys; Recrystallization (metallurgy); Residual stresses; Superalloys; Alloy 718; Crack paths; Fatigue crack growth behavior; Fatigue threshold; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Load ratio; Near thresholds; Powder bed; Threshold fatigue crack growth; Fatigue crack propagation","","","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; National Energy Technology Laboratory, NETL, (DEFE0011796); National Energy Technology Laboratory, NETL; University of New South Wales, UNSW","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory , under contract No. DEFE0011796 .

Recently, a MAM-using bound metal deposition (BMD) has been proposed as a user-friendly manufacturing method that can provide low-volume production, economical metal parts, and operation safety. Since the BMD technique is new, information on the mechanical properties of MAM parts using this technique has not been sufficiently provided. This paper aims to study the mechanical properties of MAM parts manufactured by the BMD technique, examining the elastic modulus, yield strength, ultimate strength, and fatigue behavior of the parts with different relative densities. The MAM parts made from 316L and 17-4PH stainless steel were investigated using tensile and fatigue tests. Some mechanical properties of the infill parts in this study were validated with formulas from the literature. The weight efficiency is used as an index to assess the efficiency of the infill parts with different densities by examining the relationship between the mechanical properties and the weight of the MAM parts. The experimental results and a discussion of the weight efficiency assessment are presented as a novel information report on MAM products fabricated by BMD technology. © 2022 by the authors.","17-4PH stainless steel; 316L stainless steel; bound metal deposition; fatigue test; infill density; metal additive manufacturing; tensile test","","","","","","Office of the Permanent Secretary; Chiang Mai University, CMU; Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, Thailand, MHESRI; Thailand Science Research and Innovation, TSRI","Funding text 1: This work (Grant No. RGNS 64-070) was supported by Office of the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation (OPS MHESI), Thailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI) and Chiang Mai University.; Funding text 2: This work was partially funded by Chiang Mai University, Thailand.

These AM process samples were post-processed and heat-treated by stress relief annealing at 1066 °C, HIP at 1163 °C, and solution annealing treatment at 1177 °C. The resulting microstructures and corresponding microindentation hardnesses were examined and compared with the as-built AM process microstructures and hardnesses. Fully heat-treated AM process samples were mechanically tested to obtain tensile properties and were also evaluated and compared. Principal findings in this study were that high-temperature heat treatment >1100 °C of AM process-built samples was dominant and exhibited recrystallized, equiaxed grains containing fcc {111} annealing twins and second phase particles independent of the AM process, in contrast to as-built columnar/dendritic structures. The corresponding yield stress values ranged from 285 MPa to 371 MPa, and elongations ranged from 52% to 70%, respectively.

Further, the spatial information of each monitored MP signature is essential for correlating the MP – part property. This spatial information is often unavailable especially from commercial LPBF printers. Many MP monitoring methods have been reported and utilized. However, very few of these have the MP's spatial information. To overcome this challenge, in this work we report a method for spatially registering the key MP signatures (MP intensity, temperature, and area) to the monitored print parts. The MP signatures are obtained from our coaxial high-speed single-camera based two-wavelength imaging pyrometry (STWIP) system and the MP spatial information is obtained from an off-axis camera system. A machine learning aided image analysis method is employed to retrieve the spatial distribution of MPs within the corresponding part's coordinates system. Then, the MP signature maps (MPSMs) are reconstructed by mapping the STWIP measured MP signatures to the registered MP coordinates. Further, a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is developed for estimating the layer surface topography from the registered MPSMs. The obtained results indicate that the layer surface topography can be more accurately estimated by using MP temperature signature rather than MP intensity and/or area signatures as in common practice. Our developed methods for MP monitoring, registration, and MP-surface topography prediction offer advanced capabilities for the online detection of process anomalies and part defects. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Data registration; In-situ melt pool monitoring; Laser powder bed fusion; Machine Learning; Surface topography","Cameras; Lakes; Long short-term memory; Monitoring; Multilayer neural networks; Topography; Data registration; In-situ melt pool monitoring; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Machine-learning; Melt pool; Melt pool temperature; Powder bed; Property; Spatial informations; Surface topography","","","","","AMRL; ANSYS Additive Manufacturing Research Laboratory; Department of Energy University; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (FE0031774); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; University of Pittsburgh, (MCH210015); University of Pittsburgh","Funding text 1: The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Xiayun Zhao reports financial support was provided by US Department of Energy (Award Number: FE0031774).

The effects of the bonding strip, steel fibre, specimen preparation method, loading direction and temperature on the fire resistance of 3DP-UHPC were analysed. The variations in microstructure and mineral composition of 3DP-UHPC after different temperatures were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy spectrum analyser (EDS). The strength degradation mechanism of 3DP-UHPC after the elevated temperatures was revealed in terms of the macro and micro levels. Meanwhile, the compressive strength of 3DP-UHPC after the elevated temperatures was measured, and its corresponding compressive constitutive model was proposed. The experimental results indicated that 3DP-UHPC had certain fire resistance, and the addition of steel fibre and the preparation method improved its fire resistance. The expansion of the crack at the junction of the steel fibre and matrix, as well as the oxidation and decarburization of steel fibre, affected the compressive strength of 3DP-UHPC after 400 ℃. During heating, water vapour escaped from the weak interface of the bonding strip endowed 3DP-UHPC with slightly better elevated-temperature burst resistance as compared to mould-casting ultra-high performance concrete (MC-UHPC). The compressive strength of 3DP-UHPC was the highest after 300 ℃ for the target temperatures set in this study, but the temperature had little effect on the strength difference between each direction of 3DP-UHPC. The compressive constitutive model of 3DP-UHPC after the elevated temperatures was developed, facilitating its engineering application in the field of fire safety. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3DP-UHPC; Bonding strip; Constitutive model; Fire resistance; Microstructure","3D printers; Compressive strength; Constitutive models; Degradation; Fire resistance; High performance concrete; Mechanical testing; Scanning electron microscopy; Spectrum analyzers; Steel fibers; 3d printed ultra-high performance concrete; Bonding strip; Elevated temperature; Energy spectrum; Loading direction; Loading temperature; Mechanical behavior; Mineral composition; Specimen preparation method; Strip steel; Microstructure","","","","","Tianjin City Science and Technology Support Program, (19PTZWHZ00080, 19YFZCSN01180); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51978186)","The research presented herein is jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51978186 ), Tianjin City Science and Technology Support Program (Grant No. 19YFZCSN01180 and Grant No. 19PTZWHZ00080 ).","Castillo C., Durrani A.J., Effect of transient high temperature on high-strength concrete, Acids Mater.

One of the forefront applications of the 4D printing technique is building actuators exhibiting high force of actuation, high stability, and repeatability by using a class of shape changeable SMs termed the Shape Memory Alloys (SMA). The present study is an experimental investigation of the performance of compositionally different SMA-based 4D printed actuators built using Ni–Ti, Ni–Ti–Cu, and Ni–Ti–Fe alloys. The evaluation of the performance of the built actuators is carried out through determining the debonding strength of matrix-alloy interface, and the functional capabilities, such as, the force of actuation, residual strain recovery, percentage of displacement reduction. A comparison of both the debonding strength and the functional capabilities for the chosen actuators is carried out, and individual actuators’ parameter-specific possibilities are reported. Also, the results reaped in the present study act as the baseline data to choose a specific actuator for a targeted application. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","4D printing; Debonding strength; Force of actuation; Percentage of displacement reduction; Residual strain recovery; Shape memory alloys","Debonding; Iron alloys; Shape-memory alloy; 4d printing; Debonding strength; Displacement reduction; Experimental investigations; Force of actuation; Percentage of displacement reduction; Performance; Residual strain recovery; Residual strains; Strain recovery; Actuators","","","","","IIT Dharwad; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी, (SRG/2019/000990, TTR/2021/000132); Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी; Science and Engineering Research Board, SERB","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the support of sophisticated central instrumentation facility (SCIF), IIT Dharwad, for carrying out all the Mechanical and Material characterizations.; Funding text 2: This research work is supported by the Science and Engineering Research Board, Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, under Start-up Research Grant (SRG) scheme (Project no: SRG/2019/000990), and Technology Translation Award (TETRA) (Project no: TTR/2021/000132).

However, in stretchable matrices, the use of fillers imposes significant challenges related to quality and durability. In this work, we show that long carbon staple fibers in the form of permeable carbon fiber cloth (CFC) can be placed into a stretchable thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) matrix to improve the system. Four CFC sample series (nominally 53–159-µm-thick CFC layers) were prepared with a permeable and compliant thin CFC layer and a highly conductive and stiff thick CFC layer. The sample series was tested with single pull-up tests and cyclic tensile tests with 10,000 cycles and was further studied with digital image correlation (DIC) analyses. The results showed that embedded CFC layers in a TPU matrix can be used for stretchable 3D-printed electronics structures. Samples with a thin 53 µm CFC layer retained electrical properties at 50% cyclic tensile deformations, whereas the samples with a thick >150-µm CFC layer exhibited the lowest resistance (5 Ω/10 mm). Between those structures, the 106-µm-thick CFC layer exhibited balanced electromechanical properties, with resistance changes of 0.5% in the cyclic tests after the orientation of the samples. Furthermore, the suitability of the structure as a sensor was estimated. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing; carbon fibers; electromechanical testing; strain sensor; stretchable electronics","3D printers; Fillers; Flexible electronics; Image correlation; Strain measurement; Tensile testing; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Carbon fiber cloths; Electromechanical property; Electromechanical testing; matrix; Polyurethane matrix; Strain sensors; Stretchable electronics; Thermoplastic polyurethanes; Carbon fibers","","","","","Satakunta Regional Council, (2947/31/2018); Academy of Finland, AKA, (334175); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (A73741)","This research was partially funded by the European Union Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and city of Kankaanpää under the project SOFT3L (A73741), of which the official authority is Satakunta Regional Council under Grant 2947/31/2018.

In this work, a 316L/CuSn10 multimaterial coaxial nozzle was designed and additively manufactured by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) for alleviating spattering adhesion and burning effect in directed energy deposition. The applicability of the 316L/CuSn10 nozzle was then validated in the laser-based directed energy deposition (L-DED) process. The interfacial diffusion zone of the 316L/CuSn10 structure was measured with a length of ~400 μm, indicating a well bonding between 316L and CuSn10. A high laser power (P = 230 W) and a low scanning speed (v = 300 mm/s) adopted for printing CuSn10 on 316L could lead to “keyhole mode”, resulting in a large penetration depth of the pre-solidified layer and wide diffusion zone at the interface. The spattering behavior of the 316L/CuSn10 nozzle applied in the L-DED process showed that the heterogeneity of dissimilar materials could reduce the adverse effect of the adhesion of spattering droplets. High laser reflection and high thermal conductivity of CuSn10 could relieve the burning effect of the reflected laser beam on the tip of the 316L/CuSn10 nozzle. Therefore, the utilization of CuSn10 on the nozzle tip could improve its service life. These findings may serve as a new way for low-cost and rapid mass production of the coaxial nozzles that can be applied in the L-DED technique. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Coaxial nozzle; Interface; Laser powder bed fusion; Multimaterial; Spattering","3D printers; Additives; Adhesion; Binary alloys; Deposition; Dissimilar materials; Laser beams; Nozzles; Tin alloys; 316L; Burning effects; Coaxial nozzles; Directed energy; Energy depositions; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Multi materials; Powder bed; Spattering; Copper alloys","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52073105); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2020B090922002); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2019B1515120094, 2021A1515110527); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","This article is supported by the following projects: National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 52073105 ); Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation ( 2019B1515120094 , 2021A1515110527 ), Guangdong Province Key Field Research and Development Program ( 2020B090922002 ).

However, additive manufacturing of high strength aluminum alloys is challenging due to their susceptibility to hot tearing. In this work, a systematic study has been conducted in an attempt to eliminate hot tearing in laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M) manufacturing of Al2139 alloy through selecting process parameters and the addition of an AlTiB grain refiner. It was found that hot tearing in Al2139 during PBF-LB/M can be reduced or eliminated by increasing volumetric energy density. Furthermore, grain refinement by AlTiB addition shows a clear effect in reducing hot tearing, even though the refined grains remain predominantly columnar rather than equiaxed. The effect of increasing volumetric energy density on hot tearing of Al2139 during PBF-LB/M was analyzed by thermomechanical finite-element simulation, which showed that the reduction in hot tearing with increasing energy density is associated with a decrease in the thermal residual stress. However, it was also shown that there can be a substantive loss of Mg due to evaporation at high energy densities. From a hot tearing model based on solidification thermodynamics, the loss of Mg on hot tearing in Al2139 was estimated to reduce hot tearing by up to 10%, compared to the initial powder composition. With the selected PBF-LB/M parameters, crack-free tensile specimens were fabricated, with and without the addition of AlTiB. Compared with their wrought or cast counterparts, the PBF-LB/M Al2139 and Al2139-AlTiB specimens show lower yield strength but better ductility, which can be attributed to the loss of Mg during PBF-LB/M. © 2022, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; Aluminum alloys; Grain refinement; Hot tearing; Laser powder bed fusion; Selective laser melting; Solidification cracking","","","","","","RMIT Microscopy and Microanalysis Facility; RMIT University, RMIT; Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP160100560); Australian Research Council, ARC","The authors acknowledge the facilities, and the scientific and technical assistance of the RMIT Advanced Manufacturing Precinct and the RMIT Microscopy and Microanalysis Facility.

The variations in process parameters affect the level of porosity in additively manufactured parts. Due to the complex multiphysics of the laser powder bed fusion process, surrogate models can be used to predict the amount of porosity from the process parameters. Regression and machine learning approaches have been used for the porosity prediction. However, these models are developed for certain materials. This study compares different surrogate models for correlating the amount of porosity and the process parameters in combination with proposed dimensionless numbers that are dependent to both the process parameters and powder material properties. Regression, support vector machine, and neural networks models are trained using lack of fusion porosity synthetic data for three different materials. The results show that the support vector machine and the multi-layer neural network models that use process parameters and the dimensionless numbers as the independent variables can effectively predict the amount of porosity regardless of materials. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Laser powder bed fusion; Machine learning; Neural networks; Porosity; Process mapping; Regression; Support vector machine","Forecasting; Learning systems; Multilayer neural networks; Network layers; Porosity; Regression analysis; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Powder bed; Process mapping; Process parameters; Regression; Support vectors machine; Surrogate modeling; Support vector machines","","","","","San Diego State University, SDSU; College of Arts and Letters, San Diego State University, CAL","The support from the San Diego State University is gratefully acknowledged.

The measurements obtained with FeNi18Co9Mo5 (maraging MS1 steel) particles are compared with the particle fall times calculated using the Navier–Stokes equation. The measurement powder was subjected to sieve analysis and laser system detection. Based on the results obtained, a formula was developed to determine the dust concentration depending on the number and size of particles. With filtration applied, the detector measurement range was from 16 to 100 µm. The developed solution can be the basis for the development of a dedicated sensor for powder bed fusion processes. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; air particle counter; laser sensor; powder bed fusion","Cobalt alloys; Molybdenum alloys; Navier Stokes equations; Particle size analysis; Air particle counter; Dust detectors; Dust particle; Fall time; Fusion process; Laser sensor; Laser systems; Maraging; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion; 3D printers","","","","","Ministerstwo Edukacji i Nauki, MNiSW","The paper presents results of the works performed within the internal project of the Łukasiewicz Research Network—Kraków Institute of Technology entitled “Dust analysis in the area neighbouring additive manufacturing system for Selective Laser Sintering/Melting (SLS/SLM) technology”, which was funded by the Polish Ministry of Education and Science.","Stephens B., Azimi P., El Orch Z., Ramos T., Ultrafine particle emissions from desktop 3D printers, Atmos.

However, the results about the effect of the rescanning have been indicated to be contrary from different researchers. In this study, the influence of the rescanning parameters on the surface roughness, relative density, residual stress and micro-hardness of SLMed Ti6Al4V were systematically investigated. The surface roughness decreases and the relative density improves only when the appropriate rescanning process parameters are adopted. When the sample is nearly full density, there is a negative correlation between the surface roughness and the relative density. According to the finite element model, the stress evolution experience three stages due to the thermal cycles during remelting processes, which makes the relationship between the residual stress and the rescanning parameters complicated. For the micro-hardness, it is positively correlated with the residual stress. © 2022","Characteristics; Process parameters; Rescanning method; Selective laser melting; Ti6Al4V","Melting; Microhardness; Residual stresses; Selective laser melting; Surface roughness; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Characteristic; Finite element modelling (FEM); Micro-hardness; Negative correlation; Process parameters; Relative density; Rescanning method; Selective laser melting; Stress evolution; Thermal; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Experiment Center for Advanced Manufacturing and Technology in School of Mechanical Science & Engineering of HUST; Young Talents Fund Project of Aeronautical Materials Institute; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (613281); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","Funding text 1: This research is supported by the National Program on Key Basic Research Project of China ( 613281 ) and the Young Talents Fund Project of Aeronautical Materials Institute .

To address this gap, a generic elastoplastic homogenization scheme with continuum damage model is developed, and three different lattice materials, namely cubic, modified face-center cubic and body-center cubic, are analyzed under uniaxial, biaxial and triaxial tension. The influence of micro-architecture on the material's failure behavior as well as its macroscopic mechanical performance is thoroughly discussed. For validation, a set of uniaxial tensile experiments are conducted on functionally graded cubic lattice samples that are additively manufactured using Electron Beam Melting (EBM) process. Digital image correlation technique is employed to obtain the macroscopic stress–strain curves, and manufacturing imperfections are inspected using light omitting microscopy. It turns out that the behavior of as-built samples could substantially differ from numerical predictions. Thus, a defect-informed numerical model is employed to accommodate the effect of imperfections. The outcome is in a very good agreement with experimental data, indicating that with proper input data, the developed scheme can accurately predict the mechanical and failure behavior of a given lattice material. © 2022 The Author(s)","Continuum damage; Elastoplastic homogenization; Electron beam melting; Failure mechanics; Lattice materials; Manufacturing defects; Multiaxial tension","3D printers; Computer architecture; Defects; Elastoplasticity; Electron beam melting; Electron beams; Failure (mechanical); Continuum damage; Elastoplastic homogenization; Elastoplastics; Electron-beam melting; Failure mechanics; Lattice materials; Manufacturing defects; Mechanical behavior; Multiaxial; Multiaxial tension; Additives","","","","","Vetenskapsrådet, VR; Vetenskapsrådet, VR","Danial Molavitabrizi and Mahmoud Mousavi acknowledge the financial support by the Starting Grant (2018-03636) from the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrådet).","(2017); Alana M., Cutolo A., Ruiz de Galarreta S., Van Hooreweder B., Influence of relative density on quasi-static and fatigue failure of lattice structures in Ti6Al4V produced by laser powder bed fusion, Sci.

This work seeks to correlate geometrical features of critical defects measured from fracture surfaces to the fatigue performance of laser beam powder bed fusion (L-PBF) components with machine learning and to develop an integrated data-driven analytical framework for defect criticality (IDADC). IDADC has the potential to enhance the understanding of defect-fatigue relationships in a data-driven fashion. The results show that the obtained relationships between the extracted size-related and morphology-related defect features and the fatigue life of L-PBF specimens align with the known fatigue mechanisms and influencing factors. Furthermore, the proposed IDADC framework can model the relationships between defect features and fatigue life with a low mean absolute percentage error of 0.101 using a kernel support vector regression (SVR). This work could establish the algorithmic foundation for nondestructive fatigue evaluation of additive manufacturing products from various facets of critical defects in the future. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Computer vision; Defect criticality; Laser beam powder bed fusion; Machine learning","3D printers; Additives; Computer vision; Defects; Fatigue of materials; Machine learning; Nondestructive examination; 17-4 PH stainless steel; Critical applications; Critical defects; Criticality analysis; Data driven; Defect criticality; Geometrical features; Integrated data; Laser beam powder bed fusion; Powder bed; Laser beams","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2134689); National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, (70NANB19H170)","This material is based upon work partially funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under award No. 2134689 and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) under award No. 70NANB19H170 .

For this reason, it is widely used in medical and radiological fields. However, few materials with high electron density similar to that of bone exist for fabricating a human phantom. In this study, commercially available filament materials were used with an FDM 3D printer to perform delivery quality assurance (DQA) and were evaluated for medical use. For the bone filament material, BaSO4 was synthesized in five ratios of 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, and 10% with 40% PBAT and 50~58% PLA. The electron density for the 3D printing material fabricated was obtained using kV energy CT and compared with the electron density of human organs and bones. The radiation beam properties of the 3D printed structures were analyzed as films for treatment using a linear accelerator. As a result, by changing the infill density of the material, it was possible to produce a material similar to the density of human organs, and a homogeneous bone material with HU values ranging from 371 ± 9 to 1013 ± 28 was produced. The 3D printing material developed in this study is expected to be usefully applied to the development of a patient-specific phantom to evaluate the accuracy of radiotherapy. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing technology; computed tomography (CT); delivery quality assurance (DQA); fused deposition modeling (FDM); linear accelerator; tissue equivalent materials","","","","","","Korea Foundation of Nuclear Safety; Ministry of Sciences and ICT, (2020M2D9A309417021); Nuclear Safety and Security Commission, NSSC, (2003013); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This research was supported by the Nuclear Safety Research Program through the Korea Foundation of Nuclear Safety (KoFONS) using the financial resource granted by the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission (NSSC) of the Republic of Korea (No. 2003013) & National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (Ministry of Sciences and ICT) (No. 2020M2D9A309417021).","Haleem A., Javaid M., Suman R., Singh R.P., 3D printing applications for radiology: An overview, Indian J.

In most existing mesoscale selective laser melting (SLM) modelling with ray tracing technology, laser energy has been treated as a surface heat source and laser energy absorption only occurs at reflection points in surface elements, leading to unphysical absorption energy distribution and localized temperature overestimation with extremely high peak. Here we propose a new heat source model incorporating both laser penetration and ray tracing, and accurately estimate the absorption energy distribution by calculating the laser energy attenuation during laser propagation in metal. The modified ray tracing scheme constructed here is capable of tracing ray propagation through different media and across interfaces. Computational simulations on SLM with different powder bed densities are carried out. Compared to the conventional surface heat source model in SLM simulations, our new heat source model reduces the high peak temperature of elements with low liquid volume fraction, guarantees the simulation success and eliminates the overestimation of the evaporation heat loss. Melt pool volume and depth as well as the recoil pressure is also characterized. A comparison between simulations and experimental results indicate that the proposed new heat source model is also capable of simulating the surface temperature of metal substrates upon heating pulse. In addition, keyhole morphologies from experimental observation and numerical simulations based on the proposed model are in good agreement. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Absorption energy distribution; Additive manufacturing; Heat source model; Laser heating pulse; Laser penetration; Selective laser melting (SLM)","Energy absorption; Melting; Selective laser melting; Absorption energies; Absorption energy distribution; Energy distributions; Heat source models; Heating pulse; Laser heating pulse; Laser penetration; Laser's energy; Selective laser melting; Ray tracing","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11988102)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 11988102 ).

This is a class of high-strength steel widely used in biomedical, aircraft, aerospace, offshore, and military industries thanks to its good performance in terms of strength, toughness, ductility, dimensional stability, and weldability. Laser-beam powder bed fusion (additive manufacturing) is used to fabricate this type of steel and endows it with properties that make it an excellent candidate for producing prosthetic parts, thereby facilitating a reduction in manufacturing material consumption, labour, and machining time. Given the wide range of loads biomedical components are often subjected to, the current study focused on the multiaxial behaviour of this type of steel. To this end, Fatemi–Socie (FS) and Smith–Watson–Topper (SWT) critical plane methods combined with the theory of critical distances were applied to predict the fatigue life and cracking orientation of this material, with and without notches, under three biaxial loading scenarios. Cylindrical specimens were used and these were fabricated on the base plate in the vertical orientation using a linear printing system equipped with a Nd:YAG fibre laser. The building strategy involved the deposition of 40 μm thick layers at a scan speed of 800 mm/s. The two critical plane models returned good results at low life cycle fatigue but the FS model obtained better results at high life cycle fatigue. Regarding the crack angles, SWT model produced the best predictions. © 2022","Critical plane methods; Maraging steel; Multiaxial fatigue","Cracks; Fatigue of materials; Fiber lasers; High strength steel; Laser beams; Life cycle; Maraging steel; Neodymium lasers; Offshore oil well production; Selective laser melting; Yttrium aluminum garnet; 'current; Biaxial conditions; Biomedical industry; Critical plane method; Fatigue behaviour; High-strength steels; Multi-axial fatigue; Notch fatigue; Selective laser melting; Smith-watson-topper; Additives","","","","","High Resolution Cazorla Hospital; Ubeda San Juan de la Cruz Hospital; Junta de Andalucía, (POCI-01-0247-FEDER-042536, UIDB/00285/2020, UMA18-FEDERJA-250); Junta de Andalucía","Financial support of Programa Operativo FEDER from the Junta de Andalucia (Spain) through grant reference UMA18-FEDERJA-250 is greatly acknowledged.

However, the mechanism behind grain refinement is not fully understood for conventional casting, nor for PBF. In this work, a high throughput method have been used to produce Al-2 wt%Cu alloys with additions of Ti1-xM(Zr,Ta,V,W)xB2, Al3Ti1-xM(Zr,V)x or AlB2 grain refiners for 0.1 < x < 0.9. It was found that grain size varied with x, M and the sum of Ti + M. Ti1-xMxB2 grain refiners offered no advantage over Al3Ti1-xMx. Overall, Ti and Zr provide the best grain refinement, both as Ti1-xMxB2 and Al3Ti1-xMx. However, Ti1-xZrxB2 had a grain refinement minimum around x = 0.65–0.70. The behavior was similar with Ta, but to a lesser extent. V and W had detrimental effects on grain refinement. Despite the fact that no AlB2 particles were observed, additions of B provided excellent grain refinement and was more efficient than Ti below 0.5at%. Ti1-xMxB2 lattice parameters varied with x and followed Vegard's law, however, a clear relationship between grain size and epitaxial strain/lattice match could not be established. Similarly, the growth restricting factor alone was not a predictor of grain size. © 2022 The Authors","","Additives; Aluminum compounds; Grain size and shape; High strength alloys; Refining; Tantalum compounds; Throughput; Titanium; Conventional casting; Cu alloy; Grain refiner; Grains refinement; Grainsize; High-strength alloys; High-throughput method; Hot-cracking; Powder bed; Vegard's law; Grain refinement","","","","","AMEXCI AB; Centre in Nanoscience and Technology at LiTH, (CTS 15 :219); Norsk Hydro ASA","Funding text 1: The work presented here has been made possible by financial support from Norsk Hydro ASA and The Centre in Nanoscience and Technology at LiTH.

However, it remains a challenge to minimize the postoperative exposure and infection complications due to the inert nature of conventional orbital implants. Herein, we developed a novel Ca–Zn-silicate bioceramic implant with multi-functions to achieve the expected outcomes. The porous hardystonite (Ca2ZnSi2O7) scaffolds with triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS)-based pore architecture and graded pore size distribution from center to periphery (from 500 to 800 μm or vice versa) were fabricated through the digital light processing (DLP) technique, and the scaffolds with homogeneous pores (500 or 800 μm) were fabricated as control. The graded porous scaffolds exhibited a controlled bio-dissolving behavior and intermediate mechanical strength in comparison with the homogeneous counterparts, although all of porous implants presented significant antibacterial potential against S. aureus and E. coli. Meanwhile, the pore size-increasing scaffolds indicated more substantial cell adhesion, cell viability and angiogenesis-related gene expression in vitro. Furthermore, the gradually increasing pore feature exhibited a stronger blood vessel infiltrating potential in the dorsal muscle embedding model, and the spherical implants with such pore structure could achieve complete vascularization within 4 weeks in the eyeball enucleation rabbit models. Overall, our results suggested that the novel antibacterial hardystonite bioceramic with graded pore design has excellent potential as a next-generation orbital implant, and the pore topological features offer an opportunity for the improvement of biological performances in orbital reconstruction. © 2022 The Authors","Antibacterial; Fibro-vascularization; Graded porous scaffolds; Hardystonite; Orbital implants","antiinfective agent; bioceramics; phenobarbital; animal model; animal tissue; antibacterial activity; Article; bacterial count; biocompatibility; biodegradation; bone regeneration; cell viability; CFU counting; compressive strength; computer assisted tomography; Escherichia coli; eye injury; fluorescence microscopy; human; human cell; HUVEC cell line; male; mouse; nonhuman; orbit reconstruction; polymerase chain reaction; pore size; RNA extraction; scanning electron microscopy; Staphylococcus aureus; three dimensional printing; tissue regeneration; vascularization; X ray diffraction","","phenobarbital, 50-06-6, 57-30-7, 8028-68-0","CCK-8, Dojindo, Japan; GEMINI 300, Carl Zeiss, Germany; iphone X, Apple; vivaCT100, Scancomedical, Switzerland","Apple; Carl Zeiss, Germany; Dojindo, Japan; Scancomedical, Switzerland","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81870635, 82000948); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LY20H120007); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFE0117700); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","Authors would like to acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 81870635 , 82000948 ). the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2017YFE0117700 ) and Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province ( LY20H120007 ).

The developed model accounts for various undercoolings, as well as the variation in the partition coefficient, liquidus slope, and diffusion coefficient at high velocities. The model is used to estimate the range of cellular/dendritic primary spacing during Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) for a given set of input parameters. The magnitude of various undercooling values, along with the tip Péclet number and spacing Péclet number are then estimated in order to quantify the extent of non-equilibrium at the solid–liquid interface. Good qualitative agreement is achieved between these values and the analytical KGT model. This new model can help to understand how the solid–liquid interface varies with changes in the processing conditions and material system during LPBF, and thus to improve control of microstructure evolution. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Cells; Dendrites; Laser Powder Bed Fusion; Rapid solidification","3D printers; Additives; Cellular manufacturing; Dendrites (metallography); Liquids; Phase interfaces; Undercooling; Dendrite; High velocity; Interfacial characteristics; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Non equilibrium; Powder bed; Solid-liquid interfaces; Solid/liquid; Undercoolings; Rapid solidification","","","","","","","DebRoy T., Wei H.L., Zuback J.S., Mukherjee T., Elmer J.W., Milewski J.O., Beese A.M., Wilson-Heid A., De A., Zhang W., Additive manufacturing of metallic components – process, structure and properties, Prog.

Unlike previous studies, we designed surface-type conformal cooling channels (CCC) based on the design concept for additive manufacturing, at a constant depth corresponding to the casting part. Pin fins were installed inside the surface-type cooling channels and aligned through numerical analysis to induce the turbulence of the coolant uniformly through the cooling channel while generating less thermal stress during solidification of the as-cast Al-Si alloy-based product, which increased the cooling efficiency of the proposed ECO mold. Moreover, the ECO mold was utilized to cast an automobile piston to demonstrate its feasibility at an industrial level. The results showed that, the casting process decreased significantly from 133 to 105 s per piston (21% reduction) compared to the conventional mold with a single columnar cooling channel. Additionally, the average grain size of the ECO mold decreased from 502 to 398 µm. The ultimate tensile strength and Rockwell hardness increased by 12.5% and 5.5%, respectively. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Casting; Conformal cooling channel; ECO mold; Piston","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Cooling; Molds; Pistons; Silicon alloys; Tensile strength; Conformal cooling channels; Cooling channels; Cooling optimization; Design concept; ECO mold; Eco-friendly; Fusion methods; High productivity; Laser powders; Powder bed; 3D printers","","","","","Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE, (20013122); Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE; Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology, KEIT; Korea Institute of Industrial Technology, KITECH","This work was supported by Korean Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology (KEIT) grant funded by the Korean, Korea government (MOTIE) (No.20013122) and the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology (KITECH) internal project.

However, parts produced by DED can suffer from excessive temperature gradients, and heat accumulation due to the deposition process. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the deposited area on thermos-mechanical characteristics for the case of deposition of Inconel 718 powder, on the AISI 1045 substrate, using the DED process through finite element analyses (FEAs). Nine types of FE models were developed. Temperature dependent cooling conditions were analyzed, and applied to the model. Laser heat source was defined, as the three-dimensional volumetric heat source based on the Gaussian distribution model. Temperature dependent properties were assigned to the models. The influence of the width and the length of the deposited region, on residual stress distributions in the vicinity of deposited region were investigated. Additionally, the impacts of the deposited area on deformation characteristics were examined.

It is particularly important to explore the role of elements during the AM processing and establish a new alloy design criterion. In this study, the effect of carbon, a critical element that influences the solidification and mechanical properties of superalloys, on the printability and mechanical properties of a typical non-weldable Inconel 738 (IN738) alloy processed by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) was studied. Different from the limitation of low carbon content in traditional superalloy design, it was found that a moderate increase of carbon content from 0.11 wt% (alloy IN738LC) to 0.3 wt% (alloy IN738–0.3 C) and 0.6 wt% (alloy IN738–0.6 C) can produce crack-free LPBF samples in a wide range of processing parameters. The effect of carbon content on the microstructure, tensile properties and cracking susceptibility of the LPBF-printed alloys was evaluated. With the increase of carbon content, more granular monocarbides of no more than 200 nm in size form into a quasi-continuous or continuous network at the boundaries of cellular structures, while the low melting-point phases containing boron and γ/γ′ eutectics at cellular boundaries are significantly reduced. The susceptibility to solidification cracking and liquation cracking is substantially decreased owing to the reduced level of element segregation, elimination of initiation source for liquid films, and decrease of local strain concentration. As a result, LPBF IN738–0.3 C and IN738–0.6 C show excellent ultimate tensile strength (1320 and 1598 MPa) and superior total elongation (14.7% and 9.0%), respectively. The results above demonstrate the different roles of carbon element in AM and the potential for designing AM non-weldable superalloys with improved printability and mechanical properties via alloy composition optimization. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon; Cracking susceptibility; Inconel 738; Laser powder bed fusion","Carbon; Cracks; Liquid films; Microstructure; Solidification; Tensile strength; Alloy designs; Carbon content; Cracking susceptibility; Effect of carbons; Inconel 738; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; New alloys; Powder bed; Tensile cracking; Superalloys","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51821001, 51871147); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Project Nos. 51871147 and 51821001 .","Attallah M.M., Jennings R., Wang X., Carter L.N., Additive manufacturing of Ni-based superalloys: the outstanding issues, MRS Bull., 41, pp. 758-764, (2016); Pollock T.M., Alloy design for aircraft engines, Nat.

In this paper, nanocomposites with polymer and magnetic Fe3O4@graphene fillers were printed by the DLP method where the magnetic Fe3O4@graphene inside the polymer was aligned with a magnetic field. The alignment of nanofillers significantly enhanced the mechanical properties. By varying the angle of the magnetic field, Fe3O4@graphene reinforced composites produced different mechanical properties. Aligned structure-mechanical property relation revealed that 0⁰ alignment enhanced mechanical property more compared to 90⁰ alignment of filler materials at the concentrations of 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 wt.%. This is attributed to the dispersion and orientation of the nanofillers and the photopolymerization of the monomer. The Young's modulus for the aligned 0.8 wt.% of Fe3O4@graphene(1/3) filler showed a significant improvement when a magnetic field was applied at a 0⁰ angle. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","A. composites; A. magnetic materials; B. mechanical properties","3D printers; Alignment; Elastic moduli; Fillers; Graphene; Magnetic fields; Nanocomposites; Photopolymerization; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; A composite; A magnetic material; B.Mechanical properties; B: Mechanical properties; Digital light processing; Graphene nanocomposites; Magnetic-field; Nanofiller; Magnetite","","","","","Army Research Lab","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided through Army Research Lab (Cooperative agreement W911NF 15–2–0034-S).","Hausmann M.K., Ruhs P.A., Siqueira G., Lauger J., Libanori R., Zimmermann T., Studart A.R., Dynamics of cellulose nanocrystal alignment during 3D printing, ACS Nano, 12, pp. 6926-6937, (2018); Safaee S., Chen M.P., Development of a design and characterization framework for fabrication of functionally graded materials using magnetic field-assisted digital light processing stereolithography, J.

Their mechanics are inherently anisotropic, exceeding the potential limits of common, non-architected engineering materials. In the current contribution, the design of advanced material or “metamaterial” architectures that can emulate the mechanical properties observed in native tendon and ligament tissues is analytically, experimentally, and numerically investigated. To that scope, anisotropic metamaterial designs that are based on rectangular cuboid architectures with and without inner body-centered strengthening cores are considered. Thereupon, the metamaterial design specifications required for the approximation of the highly anisotropic tissue performance, namely of the characteristic normal, shear and Poisson's ratio attributes are studied. It is shown that certain strengthened, anisotropic body-centered cuboid lattice architectures allow for substantial effective metamaterial stiffness along the primal tissue loading direction, upon a rather low shear loading resistance. The previous mechanical attributes come along with Poisson's ratio values well above unity and moderate relative density values, furnishing a combination of material characteristics that is highly desirable in restoration praxis. The analytically and numerically guided anisotropic metamaterial performance is experimentally reproduced both for the case of uniaxial and shear loads, using a microfabrication stereolithography additive manufacturing technique. The obtained scanning electron microscopy images highlight the fabrication feasibility of the identified metamaterial architectures, in scales that are directly comparable with the ones reported for the natural tissues, having feature sizes in the range of some 10ths of micrometers and elastic attributes within the range of clinical observation. © 2022 The Authors","Biomimetic; Ligament; Metamaterials; Poisson's ratio; Stiffness; Tendon","Anisotropy; Biocompatible Materials; Biomimetics; Ligaments; Tendons; Anisotropy; Architecture; Biocompatibility; Biomechanics; Biomimetics; Chemical analysis; Elasticity; Histology; Metamaterials; Poisson ratio; Restoration; Scanning electron microscopy; Tendons; biomaterial; Anisotropic metamaterials; Biological compatibility; Chemical compatibility; Compatibility analysis; Engineering challenges; Lattice-based; Mechanical compatibility; Performance; Potential limits; Restoration materials; article; clinical observation; feasibility study; human; ligament; microtechnology; relative density; rigidity; scanning electron microscopy; stereolithography; tendon; three dimensional printing; anisotropy; biomimetics; ligament; Stiffness","","Biocompatible Materials, ","","","","","Bagnaninchi P.-O., Yang Y., El Haj A.J., Maffulli N., Tissue engineering for tendon repair, Br.

However, a recess in a liquid-centered gas-liquid swirl coaxial injector may cause spray oscillations, known as self-pulsation. In this study, the effects of the recess length on the spray dynamic characteristics and their mechanisms were investigated. Four liquid-centered liquid-gas swirl coaxial injectors with different recess lengths were manufactured by metal additive manufacturing. Cold-flow tests were performed in a broad range of liquid and gas Reynolds numbers through the injectors. Pressure fluctuations in the gas and liquid injector manifolds were measured using dynamic pressure sensors, and high-speed instantaneous spray images were captured using a high-speed camera. The data obtained from the two measurement methods were analyzed using the fast Fourier transform technique. The recess length affects the frequency and intensity of the self-pulsation and stability map. In all injectors, the self-pulsation frequency increases with the liquid Reynolds number, but the effect of the gas Reynolds number differs with the recess number. Thus, the characteristics of self-pulsation change depending on whether the recess number <1 or ≥1. The present experimental results were utilized in proposing self-pulsation mechanisms based on the recess number. © 2022 IAA","Dynamic characteristics; Liquid rocket engine; Liquid-centered swirl coaxial injector; Pressure fluctuation; Recess length; Self-pulsation","Combustion; Fast Fourier transforms; Gases; High speed cameras; Liquefied gases; Rockets; Combustion efficiencies; Dynamics characteristic; Gas liquids; Liquid rocket engines; Liquid-centered swirl coaxial injector; Pressure fluctuation; Recess lengths; Reynold number; Self-pulsations; Swirl coaxial injectors; Reynolds number","","","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; Korea Aerospace Research Institute, KARI, (KARI–FR21C00); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (2021M1A3B8077772, NRF–2021M1A3B9095872)","This research was supported by the National Research Foundation ( NRF–2021M1A3B8077772 , NRF–2021M1A3B9095872 ) and the Korea Aerospace Research Institute ( KARI–FR21C00 ) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning, South Korea .

The effect of different process parameters and supplementary remelting on the densification of the samples was evaluated. Results showed that remelting the printed layers could improve the densification. According to the microstructural observations, stacking the nanoparticles on uneven surfaces of irregular AlSi10Mg particles beside van der Waals's attractive force between the adjacent particles eventually forms coarsened clusters in printed samples. The XRD patterns disclosed the partial reaction between the nano-oxides and the aluminum matrix and the formation of some interfacial intermetallic layers, which were also validated by SEM characterization. The measurement of grain size and microhardness implied that the addition of Er2O3 played a more effective role in grain refinement and enhanced the hardness more uniformly compared to Gd2O3. Overall, the acquired average hardness for both nano-oxide reinforced specimens was greater than the reported values for LPBF-fabricated AlSi10Mg-matrix composites in the past. EBSD analyses revealed that due to the pinning effect of the nanoparticles, particle-rich zones demonstrated higher KAM and grain orientation spread (GOS) values which were attributed to the formation of more GNDs at the matrix/particles interfaces. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Additive manufacturing; AlSi10Mg; Hardness; Lack of fusion; Nanoparticles","Additives; Aluminum compounds; Gadolinium compounds; Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; Nanoparticles; Particle size analysis; Silicon compounds; Van der Waals forces; Comparatives studies; Densifications; Lack of fusion; Laser powders; Micro-structural observations; Nano-oxides; Powder bed; Process parameters; Stackings; Uneven surfaces; Hardness","","","","","","","Zhang Y., Li S., Zhao Y., Duan W., Liu B., Wang T., Wang G., Digital light processing 3D printing of AlSi10Mg powder modified by surface coating, Additive Manufacturing, 39, (2021); Gao C., Liu Z., Xiao Z., Zhang W., Wong K., Akbarzadeh A., Effect of heat treatment on SLM-fabricated TiN/AlSi10Mg composites: microstructural evolution and mechanical properties, J.

In order to verify the potential of h-BN in additively built cemented carbides, the study focused primarily on determining the ideal concentration and how it influences microstructure and mechanical characteristics. Commercial powders of WC-17Co composite mixed with 10 vol. % h-BN, 5 vol. % h-BN, and 3 vol. % h-BN were processed using selective laser melting (SLM). Benchmarked against an unmodified SLM-processed WC-17Co, evaluation of the h-BN composites was primarily dependent on the volume fraction of h-BN added. WC-17Co with 10 vol. % h-BN composite resulted in high levels of pores (~ 3% porosity) and microcracks. This was attributed to poor adhesive bonding between h-BN and WC-17Co, leading to the onset of pores and cracks during processing. However, high densification was observed in both 3 vol. % and 5 vol. % h-BN with the 3 vol. % h-BN attaining the highest densification (0.83% porosity) while having a density 0.07% lesser than the unmodified specimen (11.33 g/cm3). Comparing the XRD analyses of the specimens yielded two distinct findings. Unlike the unmodified WC-17Co specimen, none of the reinforced specimens contained the undesirable W2C phase at all. It is thus possible to prevent the formation of the W2C phase by adding hBN to WC-17Co. There were no hexagonal BN phases found in the specimens, either. Rather, phases like Co-W-B and W-B were indexed in the specimens. WC carbides, WC platelets, and a secondary phase (Co-W-B) were observed in both the 5 vol. % and 3 vol. % h-BN composites. The volume fraction of WC platelets increased as the h-BN content increased. This was attributed to the sluggish grain growth favorable for WC platelets induced during processing due to h-BN addition. Hardness increased 28.7% with 3 vol. % h-BN as opposed to the unmodified WC-17Co. This was attributed to the reduced WC carbide grain sizes observed in the WC-17Co with 3 vol. % h-BN. In addition, the 5 vol. % h-BN specimen had the highest fracture toughness value (6.97 MPa√m) due to the high-volume fraction of WC platelets in that specimen. WC platelets contain few basal planes resulting in lower possibility in stacking faults interfering with crack propagation. In all, the specimen with 3 vol. % h-BN showed better mechanical properties than its unmodified counterpart. Thus, utilizing 3 vol. % h-BN in cemented carbide could be beneficial for SLM-processed cemented carbides. © 2022, Crown.","Additive manufacturing; Cemented carbide; Hexagonal boron nitride; Mechanical properties;

Biofeedback plays a significant role in substituting such sensory data when sensory functions of an individual are reduced or lost such as neurological disorders including stroke causing loss of sensory and motor functions requires compensation of both motor and sensory functions. Biofeedback substitution can be in the form of several means: mechanical, electrical, chemical and/or combination. This study proposes a soft monolithic haptic biofeedback device prototyped and pilot tests were conducted with healthy participants that balance and proprioception of the wearer were improved with applied mechanical stimuli on the lower limb(s). The soft monolithic haptic biofeedback device has been developed and manufactured using fused deposition modelling (FDM) that employs soft and flexible materials with low elastic moduli. Experimental results of the pilot tests show that the soft haptic device can effectively improve the balance of the wearer as much as can provide substitute proprioceptive feedback which are critical elements in robotic rehabilitation. © 2022 by the authors.

We make use of the thermodynamic topology optimization based on a linear elastic compliance minimization, i. e. minimization of the elastic strain energy of the whole structure. We investigate, how the optimization of the rather theoretical strain energy influences the efficiency of more practical measurements, i. e. the force-displacement response at the loading points and the maximum tolerable force. For this purpose, starting from a cuboid design space with the boundary conditions of a 3-point and 4-point bending stress, the geometry with constant volume was optimized. The topology-optimized bending beams were subsequently produced by stereolithography and mechanically tested with respect to the previously defined boundary conditions. In order to avoid a falsification of results due to internal sample defects, all samples were previously examined with the aid of computer tomography with regard to the defects in the volume. As a general result, the topology-optimized bending beams can bear a higher load in the experiment, which shows the usefulness of the coupling of additive manufacturing and topology optimization methods without any special constraints or enhancements regarding the manufacturing process within the optimization. © 2022 The Authors.

The cellular structure, theoretically excellent mechanical performance, and tunable low density make the lattice structure an ideal structure. In the past, research on complex structures was limited by manufacturing technology. The advent of additive manufacturing has enabled detailed studies of such lattice structures. Simple Cubic (SC) plate lattice is believed to be capable of reaching the theoretical limitation of mechanical performance in nanoscale; thus, it is of great significance to explore potential application of this cubic plate lattice. In this work, projection micro-stereolithography (PµSL) was used to print cubic plate lattices. The effect of geometrical parameters on mechanical properties was studied. Results demonstrate that increasing the number of cells leads to a superior increase in compressive strength and energy absorption, which shows obvious mechanical metamaterials properties. Moreover, the specific energy absorption of these polymeric lattices can even outperform stainless steel lattices, indicating that they have great potential for applications in high energy absorption, strength, and light-weighting. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Energy absorption; Mechanical metamaterials; projection microstereolithography; Simple cubic plate lattice","Additives; Compressive strength; Energy absorption; Geometry; Industrial research; Metamaterials; Plates (structural components); Structural properties; Cellular structure; Compressive properties; High performance material; Lattice structures; Mechanical; Mechanical metamaterial; Mechanical performance; Projection micro-stereolithography; Simple cubic; Simple cubic plate lattice; 3D printers","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering NTU","The authors acknowledge the support from Materials Science and Engineering NTU on the present work.

Most metal AM techniques utilize alloys designed for traditional processing conditions, such as casting, whereas implementing alloys designed for AM may prove useful. Given the proven utility of the Al-Mg-Zr-Si Addalloy 5T® in melt-driven AM, this study investigated the use of this alloy in cold spray (CS), as minimal research has explored alloy design for use in solid-state processing. The as-atomized powder and CS samples were evaluated microstructurally and mechanically to determine suitability for CS. Premature brittle fracture were seen in the deposits, necessitating processing improvements for enhanced deposit performance. Feedstock thermal pre-processing was explored, guided by thermodynamic modeling, to improve spray-ability. Heat treatments resulted in generalized powder softening, suggesting improved processability using a CS gas-particle dynamics model. This model allowed for theoretical tuning of processing parameters, predicting improved deposition using a specific configuration with He gas. The through-process model-informed experimental approach emphasizes the potential of using Addalloy 5T® powder in CS when coupling heat treatment with processing parameter optimization. Results suggest that the CS community may benefit from alloy design specifically for solid-state processing, tailoring powder chemistry and microstructure for enhanced properties and processability. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Alloy design; Aluminum; Cold spray; Heat treatment; Powder","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Deposits; Heat treatment; Magnesium alloys; Powder metals; Silicon alloys; Zircaloy; Alloy designs; Cold spray; Laser powders; Manufacturing IS; Metal additives; Novel applications; Powder bed; Processability; Processing parameters; Solid-state processing; 3D printers","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (DMR200035); National Science Foundation, NSF; DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory, DEVCOM ARL, (911-NF1920108); DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory, DEVCOM ARL","This work was funded by DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory, grant #W911-NF1920108, and the National Science Foundation , grant number DMR200035 .

Ti-6Al-4V is one of the most promising materials due to its biocompatibility. However, excessive ions release can occur, leading to a relevant immunologic response in the surrounding tissues. Despite the corrosion behavior of the conventionally-manufactured material being well known, it should be assessed for AM-processed components, as the effect of the unique superficial and microstructural features granted by the process is still quite unknown. The aim of this paper is the electrochemical evaluation of the passive current density of the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF)-processed Ti-6Al-4V alloy via potentiostatic tests, carried out at typical in-service potentials for biomedical implants. This parameter is correlated with the ion release rate of the alloy, a fundamental phenomenon to address to prevent possible inflammations caused by the implant. Different manufacturing conditions (surface finishing, heat treatment) and exposure time (0, 60 and 6000 h) were considered. The importance of performing these measurements over a long period (> 8 months) was demonstrated. In fact, despite the initial current densities being significantly affected by the surface and microstructural differences, the ion release rates converged for long-time exposures. The results also underlined the good corrosion resistance of the material. Poor corrosion performances, alongside with significant current densities development, were observed in the as-built condition. A pickling treatment demonstrated to mitigate such effect without compromising the unique surface finishing granted by the manufacturing technology. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Biocompatibility; Ions release; Passive current; Titanium","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Aluminum corrosion; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant alloys; Current density; Heat resistance; Heat treatment; Ions; Surface treatment; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Topography; 'current; Additive manufacturing technology; Biomedical applications; Ion release; Ion release rate; Laser powders; Passive current; Powder bed; Surface finishing; Titania; Biocompatibility","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/P025021/1)","","Abdel-Hady Gepreel M., Niinomi M., Biocompatibility of Ti-alloys for long-term implantation, J.

Vat photopolymerisation 3D printing core technology has been used to compensate for the limitations of traditional hot-injection processes in the preparation of complex cores. However, 3D printed cores exhibit anisotropy of strength and sintering shrinkage, which requires further research and development. Herein, ceramic core samples were prepared from the X, Y, and Z directions using vat photopolymerisation 3D printing technology, and the anisotropic behaviour was systematically studied. The mechanism of core delamination was studied using a finite element simulation of slurry spreading during the printing process. In the slurry spreading process, the flow rate of the slurry middle layer was faster than that of the upper and lower surfaces, and fine particles concentrated more easily on the upper and lower surfaces. The interface between the layers was composed of fine particles. The interfacial sintering was compact and the pores were small. The interior of the lamellar structure was composed of coarse particle with large and dispersed pores. In addition, the distribution of pores within the 3D printed core presents an evolution law during the sintering process. With an increase in the sintering temperature, the pores move toward the interface between the layers and are enriched, and the pores coalesced to form larger pores at the interface. When sintered at high temperatures, the interfacial pores formed a gradient line between the porous layers. The combination of finite element simulation and experimentation provides theoretical guidance for the control of the layered structure and anisotropy of 3D printed cores. This promotes the application of 3D printed ceramic technology in the industrial field. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Anisotropy; Ceramic cores; Lamellar structure; Porosity evolution","3D printers; Aircraft engines; Finite element method; Lamellar structures; Photopolymerization; Sintering; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Ceramic core; Fine-particles; Finite elements simulation; Intra-layer; Particles distribution; Photo polymerization; Pore evolution; Porosity evolutions; Anisotropy","","","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFB1106600); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (WK5290000003); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Major Science and Technology Projects of China, (2017-VI-0002–0072, Y2019-VII-0011-0151); National Major Science and Technology Projects of China","This work was supported by the National Science and Technology Major Project (Nos. 2017-VI-0002–0072 and Y2019-VII-0011-0151 ); National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2018YFB1106600 ); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( WK5290000003 ).","Pollock T.M., Alloy design for aircraft engines, Nat.

Based on an experimental investigation and a numerical simulation, this paper studied the effect of geometric size and structural feature on the residual stress and distortion of hollow Ti-alloy blades fabricated using SLM. The results indicated that the distortion of blades increased with the increase in height and torsion angle of the blades. However, distortion obviously decreased when the stiffened plates were set inside the blades and the blade thickness increased. When the number of stiffened plates increased from zero to three and the blade thickness increased from 0.5 to 2 mm, the distortion value was reduced by the biggest rate of 38 and 35%, respectively. In addition, the residual stress along the building direction was found to play a dominant role in inducing the distortion. This study showed a new viewpoint to reduce the distortion by optimizing the geometric size and structural feature of a metal part. © 2022, ASM International.","distortion; hollow blade; residual stress; selective laser melting; titanium alloy","Aluminum alloys; Melting; Numerical models; Plates (structural components); Selective laser melting; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Blade thickness; Experimental investigations; Geometric sizes; High thermal; Hollow blades; Laser melting process; Selective laser melting; Stiffened plate; Structural feature; Titanium (alloys); Residual stresses","","","","","Shanghai Key Laboratory of Advanced Ferrometallurgy; Shanghai Sailing Program, (19YF1417500); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM, (19DZ2270200); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM; Shanghai University, SHU, (SKLASS2020-10); Shanghai University, SHU; State Key Laboratory of Advanced Special Steel","This work was supported by the Shanghai Sailing Program [19YF1417500] and Open Project of State Key Laboratory of Advanced Special Steel, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Advanced Ferrometallurgy, Shanghai University (SKLASS2020-10) and the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (No. 19DZ2270200) ","Wang Y.M., Voisin T., Mckeown J.T., Ye J., Calta N.P., Li Z., Zeng Z., Zhang Y., Chen W., Roehling T.T., Additively Manufactured Hierarchical Stainless Steels with High Strength and Ductility, Nat.

The specimens were fabricated using the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) method with infill density variation of 15, 25, 50, and 75% and infill pattern variation of the concentric, grid, and trihexagonal. The mechanical behavior of the specimens was tested by tensile test method and analytical observation of the specimen's fracture shape was performed. The result shows that increasing infill density could increase Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength of the specimens. Moreover, the concentric infill pattern always exhibits the highest Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength value compared to the grid and trihexagonal infill patterns. Based on the fracture shapes, the concentric infill pattern shows almost a flat fracture surface that is perpendicular to the applied tensile stress, confirming the brittle fracture mode. On the other hand, variations of fracture shape angle are found in the grid and trihexagonal infill pattern specimens. This might be due to the shifting direction of the maximum normal stress following the infill pattern direction. However, as the infill density reaches 75%, all specimens regardless of its infill pattern show a flatter fracture surface. Hence, the effect of infill pattern could be minimized if the infill density is near to 100%. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.","3D printing; FDM method; Fracture behavior; Infill density and pattern; Mechanical properties","","","","","","Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia, UPI; Sampoerna University; Kementerian Riset dan Teknologi /Badan Riset dan Inovasi Nasional, Ristek-BRIN","We acknowledged LPDP research grant, No. PRJ-85/LPDP/2020, and CRCS of Sampoerna University for providing generous financial and technical supports for running this research.

In this work, AISI 316L stainless steel specimens were fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), and its microstructure was characterized by several techniques. Tensile tests with in situ x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using synchrotron radiation. Stress–strain curves and diffractograms were obtained for the as-printed AM 316L, annealed AM 316L and conventional/rolled 316L samples for comparison. The results indicated lower ductility for the AM samples when compared to the sheet. This can be a result of the remaining porosity associated with the AM process. The annealing of the AM samples led to a reduction of the residual stress and an improvement of ductility without significant loss on the ultimate tensile strength. In situ XRD data indicated that AM samples did not undergo phase transformation during straining, maintaining a fully austenitic microstructure and preventing a transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) effect. On the other hand, in the rolled sample, peaks of α′-martensite were identified. Electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) measurements indicated that a random texture was achieved by the parameters and scanning strategy used. The results indicate that process parameters must be carefully chosen in order to avoid porosity, and excessive residual stresses, features that directly affect the mechanical behavior of the material. © 2022, ASM International.","316-L austenitic stainless steel; additive manufacturing; heat treatment; in situ x-ray diffraction; laser powder bed fusion","3D printers; Additives; Deformation; Ductility; Metadata; Porosity; Residual stresses; Steel research; Strain; Synchrotron radiation; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Textures; X ray diffraction; 316 L stainless steel; 316-L austenitic stainless steel; 316L; Complex geometries; Custom parts; In-situ X-ray diffraction; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; X-ray diffraction studies; Austenitic stainless steel","","","","","Department of Materials Science and Engineering; Ohio State University, OSU; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2019/06679-1); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES","The authors acknowledge LNNano/LNLS/CNPEM for technical support and infrastructure used in Proposals 20180252 and 20190101, Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Ohio State University (OSU) for the infrastructure used, GE Additive for the machine donation, CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel) and São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP, grant #2019/06679-1) for financial support.

Its potential for controlling transformation into arbitrary three-dimensional (3D) shapes needs to be realized. This study aimed to develop a novel programming control strategy. A flat sheet obtained by discretizing the curved surface with cross-structure units without in-plane strain interference can be deformed into an arbitrary 3D space surface model. The division of the deformable and central fixed parts of the cross-structure prevents deformation interference. Fused filament fabrication pre-programmed four-dimensional printing technology was used to control the deformable part transformation. The self-developed software performed the flattening, discretization, and optimization of the target surface to generate a printed plane model composed of a cross-structure. A self-developed slicing tool completed the printing process. The finite element simulation results of the sample model were consistent with those of the target surface. The experimental results of the model deformation confirmed the effectiveness and accuracy of the approach. The novel programming control strategy for printing arbitrarily complex 3D deformation systems exhibited high theoretical precision. Its universality promotes development of the shape-morphing system manufacturing field. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","4D printing; Cross-structure unit; Discretization; Shape programming","3D modeling; Strain; 4d printing; Application scenario; Control strategies; Cross structures; Cross-structure unit; Discretizations; Shape morphing; Shape programming; Structure unit; Target surface; Deformation","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52075324); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by the Research Fund for the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant No. 52075324 ].

In the present work, additive manufacturing and topological optimization are integrated to develop a novel body- and edge-centered 12 vertices lattice structure with modified triangular prismatic strut pattern (MTP-lattice). Finite element models of MTP-lattice were first established in PAM-CRASH and then experimentally verified via compressive test. The validated finite element models were then employed to investigate the novel MTP-lattice’s energy absorption and mechanical behavior under axial and offset loading. The results show that topology-optimized MTP-lattice has a superior energy absorption performance compared with competing unit cells. Besides, its mechanical performance is greatly influenced by the strut pattern and shape parameters. Furthermore, the deformation evolution from the overall structure to the strut level during the entire compression process was analyzed. The observations illustrate that the MTP-lattice exhibits a steady deformation mode with optimal shape parameters, which appears to have a promising prospect for the application of crashworthy components. The research results provide excellent guidance for the application of novel lightweight energy-absorbing lattice. © IMechE 2022.","additive manufacturing; energy absorption; mechanical property; modified triangular prismatic-lattice; topology optimization","Additives; Crashworthiness; Deformation; Finite element method; Melting; Selective laser melting; Shape optimization; Struts; Topology; Design freedom; Energy absorption capability; Finite element modelling (FEM); Lattice structures; Mechanical energies; Melting method; Modified triangular prismatic-lattice; Selective laser melting; Topological optimization; Topology optimisation; Energy absorption","","","","","Science and Technology Research and Development Plan of China National Railway Corporation, (N2020J027); Dalian Science and Technology Innovation Fund, (2019J11CY017)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Science and Technology Research and Development Plan of China National Railway Corporation [grant number N2020J027]; and Dalian Fund Plan of Science and Technology Innovation [grant number 2019J11CY017].

Firstly, parameters of Mo powder with continuous size distribution utilized in actual AM production were calibrated and input into discrete element model (DEM) for parametric study on powder spreading. Then, the laser melting of the spread powder bed was simulated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD). On this basis, a back propagation neural network (BPNN) model was built for powder bed quality and molten track property prediction and evaluation. Results show that properly reducing the spreading velocity V or increasing the gap height H can contribute to the optimal structure of the powder bed. Corresponding mechanism analyses reveal that the residual velocity of particles and force chain block are the main reasons for the decrease of powder bed quality. And the molten track performance is not positively correlated with the packing density of the powder bed due to the defects such as balling and porosity caused by the over-thickness of powder bed. The selection rule of powder bed should satisfy as higher as possible the packing density within the bed thickness threshold. The BPNN model can accurately predict the powder bed quality and the molten track property and develop a reasonable map for the appropriate choice of operating parameters in real processes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","BPNN prediction; DEM/CFD simulations; Molybdenum additive manufacturing; Powder-bed-fusion; Selective laser melting","Additives; Backpropagation; Computational fluid dynamics; Forecasting; Melting; Neural networks; Particle size analysis; Selective laser melting; Structural optimization; Back propagation neural network prediction; Back-propagation neural networks; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Discrete element model/computational fluid dynamic simulation; Discrete element models; Molybdenum additive manufacturing; Neural network predictions; Powder bed; Powder-bed-fusion; Selective laser melting; Molybdenum","","","","","CAS Interdisciplinary Innovation Team Project, (JCTD-2020–10); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51374070); Liaoning Revitalization Talents Program, (XLYC1805007)","The authors are grateful to the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51374070 ), Liaoning Revitalization Talents Program ( XLYC1805007 ), and CAS Interdisciplinary Innovation Team Project ( JCTD-2020–10 ) of China for the financial support of current work.

The current work develops a crack-free and novel high-strength Al-Cu-Mg-Y alloy fabricated by LPBF using the rare earth yttrium (Y) modified 2024 alloy powders. In the LPBF-fabricated Al-Cu-Mg-Y alloy, the rare earth element Y is revealed as an effective alloying element for the solidification crack elimination, which is mainly attributed to the combination of the narrowed brittle temperature range, the decreased solidification crack susceptibility index and the refined grains. The element Y can also react with Al and Cu to form the Al8Cu4Y phases during the LPBF process. In the LPBF-fabricated Al-Cu-Mg-Y alloy, the larger number of Al8Cu4Y phases and the finer grains result in higher compressive yield strength than most LPBF-fabricated Al alloys. Interestingly, the LPBF-fabricated Al-Cu-Mg-Y alloy can be highly deformed without collapse up to a large compressive strain of ~70 %. After T6 heat treatment, the LPBF-fabricated Al-Cu-Mg-Y alloy exhibits a significant increase in the compressive stress after the yield point, corresponding to the homogeneously distributed Ω precipitate in the Al matrix. In addition, the tensile strength is lower than the compressive strength for the LPBF-fabricated and T6 heat-treated Al-Cu-Mg-Y alloys. This difference is related to the internal pores in the two alloys. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; High-strength Al alloys; Laser powder bed fusion; Rare earth element Y; Solidification crack","Additives; Alloying elements; Aluminum alloys; Compressive strength; Copper alloys; Cracks; Fabrication; Heat treatment; High strength alloys; Magnesium alloys; Precipitation (chemical); Rare earth elements; Rare earths; Solidification; Tensile strength; Ternary alloys; Yield stress; Al-alloy; Crack free; High-strength; High-strength al alloy; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Microstructure characterization; Powder bed; Rare earth element Y; Solidification cracks; 3D printers","","","","","Postdoctoral Science and Technology Activity Program of Hubei Province, (0106110134); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51790174, 52005196); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2020M672341, 2020M682410); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 52005196 and 51790174 ), Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China (Nos. 2020M672341 and 2020M682410 ) and Postdoctoral Science and Technology Activity Program of Hubei Province (No. 0106110134 ).

A striking feature of these novel materials is the substantial number of constituent strut elements contained in them, e.g., more than 5 × 105 struts (diameter: 0.5 mm; length: 5.0 mm) in a common tetrahedron lattice with dimensions of 200 × 200 × 200 mm3. A prerequisite for realizing the full design potential of these structures is to ensure the robust additive continuity of each constituent strut, which refers to geometric continuity between two successive layers of a strut, in order to achieve high lattice structural integrity. This critical issue has, however, remained unanswered. Herein we formulate a design-and-manufacture interlocked strut additive continuity model for powder bed fusion (PBF) and apply it to the entire design gamut of Ti-6Al-4 V struts. On this basis, a strut additive continuity threshold value (φ = 0.9) is proposed and validated with 23,100 inclined struts in Ti-6Al-4 V lattices manufactured by electron beam PBF (EB-PBF). Design maps are then constructed for EB-PBF of lattice materials. Furthermore, a minimum powder-bed density (0.6ρTD) for powder selection and a powder-specific initial layer thickness (0.6Dv(90)) are recommended. This work establishes a necessary basis for the design and manufacture of robust lattice materials by EB-PBF including graded lattices. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive continuity; InclinationPowder bed density; Lattice Materials; Lattice strut; Layer thickness","3D printers; Structural design; Struts; Additive continuity; Bed density; Design and manufactures; Electron-beam; Functional properties; Inclinationpowder bed density; Lattice materials; Lattice strut; Layer thickness; Powder bed; Additives","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP200102666); Australian Research Council, ARC; RMIT University, RMIT; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51829401); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFB0700301); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; Science Challenge Project, (TZ2018006-0302-01); Science Challenge Project","Funding text 1: This project was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China through No. 51829401 , the Science Challenge Project (No. TZ2018006-0302-01 ) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China through No. 2016YFB0700301 .

Accordingly, an understanding of the relation between various process parameters and residual stress evolution needs to be addressed in metal AM. Therefore, this article investigates adaptive layer-wise heat-input in gas metal arc-based additive manufacturing (GMA-WAAM) through the finite element method. A 3D finite element model has been developed using Mechanical Advanced Parametric Design Language of Ansys® software. A reduced current heat-input strategy has been adopted, i.e. the current is reduced for every next layer until the fourth layer. It is repeated for the next set of four layers. The effect of the proposed framework has been studied on the single-track eight-layered thin wall geometry. Further, experiments have been performed to validate the developed model. A good agreement has been found between predicted and experimental results. Moreover, the developed framework has been found as an effective strategy to control the evolution of accumulated heat and distortion in the substrate. A significant decrease in the maximum temperature was attained during the layer-wise deposition, i.e. 11.29% and 15.09% for the first and second sets of four layers. © 2022, The Institution of Engineers (India).","Additive manufacturing; GMA welding; GMA-WAAM; Heat-input; Thermal model","Additives; Finite element method; Gas welding; Residual stresses; 'current; GMA welding; GMA-WAAM; Heat accumulation; Heat input; Layer-wise; Metal additives; Numerical investigations; Thermal model; Thermal residual stress; 3D printers","","","","","","","Montevecchi F., Grossi N., Takagi H., Scippa A., Sasahara H., Campatelli G., Procedia CIRP, 46, pp. 476-479, (2016); Srivastava S., Garg R.K., Sachdeva A., Sharma V.S., J.

Most of those alloys are not suitable for laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) processing due to the non-weldable nature of the alloys developed for casting, forging, and machining. Even some weldable alloys can be difficult to produce with L-PBF because the characteristics of L-PBF, such as highly concentrated heat input and the extremely high cooling rate, can lead to very high residual stresses and cracking. In order to speed up the development process of new alloys for additive manufacturing, a powder-free evaluation method was used to evaluate the materials processing window and susceptibility to cracking. Single tracks were scanned with an L-PBF machine onto H13 steel substrates. The substrate condition was varied, and its effect on melt pool geometry and cracking behavior was evaluated. The results clearly show that thermal history of the substrate influences its thermal conductivity, affecting melt pool volume. Melting point of the substrate was not found as significant factor as thermal conductivity on melt pool dimensions. Cracking type was noted to differ between substrates. If printability is assessed without powder, the substrate microstructure should be similar to rapidly solidified material. It is recognized that single-track tests are not adequate in terms of residual stress evaluation, but they can give valuable information about materials’ melting, segregation, and micro-scale cracking behavior. © 2022, The Author(s).","additive manufacturing; cracking; single track; thermal conductivity; tool steel","3D printers; Additives; Heat treatment; Lakes; Residual stresses; Substrates; Thermal conductivity; Tools; Carbon tool steels; Cracking behavior; Heat input; Laser powders; Laser scanning; Manufacturing process; Melt pool; Powder bed; Single-tracks; Weldable alloy; Tool steel","","","","","Teknologian Tutkimuskeskus VTT","The authors would like to express their gratitude to Mrs. Seija Kivi for the preparation and imaging of the metallographic specimens, to Kimmo Ruusuvuori for operation of the SLM 125 HL system, and to Jarkko Metsäjoki for EBSD measurements.

However, the variables like alloy types, process parameters, printing method, and printer types govern the defects formation, microstructure evolution, and mechanical properties of the component during service conditions. In this work, multiple machine learning models have been implemented to predict the densification of Al-50 Si alloy for the given input parameters. Three hundred and fifty samples have been printed by selective laser melting route for different power, scan speed, and hatch distance and their densification has been measured using Archimede’s principle. Random forest, decision tree, and neural network-based algorithms have been used to predict the densification. The decision tree model exhibited R2 value of 93.16% and outperformed the random forest model. Neural network model has predicted the densification with a minimum mean square error of 1.1994×10−04 for 500 iterations. The random forest model is implemented to identify the importance of process parameters on the densification and it is also observed that the scan speed is the most significant and hatch distance is the least significant parameter. The three models are experimentally validated and neural network-based model is able to predict densification with accuracy. © 2022, ASM International.","Al-Si alloy; feature importance; machine learning; validation","3D printers; Aluminum alloys; Densification; Forecasting; Machine learning; Mean square error; Random forests; Silicon alloys; Densifications; Feature importance; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Parameter dependents; Process parameters; Random forest modeling; Scan speed; Validation; Decision trees","","","","","","","Dai H.S., Liu X.F., Refinement Performance and Mechanism of an Al-50Si Alloy, Mater.

With wall thicknesses reduced down to 100 µm, this process significantly enhances the structural design freedom, enabling the design of multi-functional, lightweight, stiff, and strong components. However, from a manufacturing perspective, as the wall thicknesses approach the printing resolution, this process is likely to introduce geometric defects, and informed quality assurance of the 3D-printed structures becomes critical. From a structural perspective, the mechanical properties of thin-walled structures are known to be highly sensitive to manufacturing defects. To quantify the process-induced geometric defects and to understand the influences of the geometric defects on the mechanical properties of thin shell lattices, we propose a micro X-ray computed tomography (XCT) based finite element (FE) modelling methodology, which is validated here for Primitive-type shell lattices fabricated by μLPBF in stainless steel. Four types of geometric defects, namely thickness variations, through-thickness defects (holes) on shell surfaces, surface waviness and roughness, are incorporated into the shell element-based FE models. The detailed evaluation of numerical and experimental compression test results shows that the defect-informed simulation approach provides significantly improved prediction accuracy compared to the ideal geometry model in terms of stiffness, peak stress, plateau stress and densification behaviour. The respective influences of each type of defect and their combinations on the mechanical properties of the shell lattices are studied, highlighting that surface roughness and thickness variations lead to prominent impact on the reduction of both linear and nonlinear mechanical properties. © 2022","Finite element method; Geometric defects; Micro laser powder bed fusion; Thin shell lattices; X-ray computed tomography","3D printers; Compression testing; Computerized tomography; Fabrication; Geometry; Quality assurance; Shells (structures); Stiffness; Structural design; Surface roughness; Thin walled structures; Geometric defects; Laser powders; Micro laser powder bed fusion; Microlaser; Powder bed; Thickness variation; Thin shell lattice; Thin shells; Wall thickness; X-ray computed tomography; Finite element method","","","","","Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR; Science and Engineering Research Council, SERC, (142 68 00088)","The authors acknowledge the support from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and the Science and Engineering Research Council ( SERC ) of Singapore through the Additive Manufacturing Centre (AMC) Initiative – SIMTech-led R&D projects (SERC Grant no. 142 68 00088 ).

Here, a detailed printability assessment of NiTiHf HT-SMAs fabricated using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) AM is conducted for the first time. Specifically, the regions associated with lack of fusion, keyholing, and balling regimes are quantitatively classified through an efficient printability assessment framework. Nearly porosity-free specimens are achieved from the predicted good printable region. The effects of key processing parameters (laser power, scanning speed, and hatch spacing) on the microstructure variation and phase transformation characteristics are studied systematically. A positive correlation is observed between the transformation temperatures and volumetric energy density (EV). Beyond a critical EV of 100 J/mm3, the transformation temperatures become insensitive to further increases in EV. At identical or similar energy density levels, the individual change of laser power, scanning speed, or hatch spacing alters the transformation behavior to a certain extent. It is hypothesized that to a large extent, this behavior is due to the effects that processing conditions have on the differential evaporation of Ni from the melt pool. A model connecting thermal histories, scanning strategy and chemistry changes is found to be consistent with this hypothesis. It is shown that the transformation temperatures in AM NiTiHf HT-SMAs can be varied over a range of more than 160 °C by controlling Ni evaporation through altering processing parameters. © 2022 The Authors","Differential evaporation; High temperature shape memory alloys (HT-SMAs); Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF); NiTiHf; Printability","Additives; High temperature applications; Martensitic transformations; Morphology; Nickel; Selective laser melting; Superalloys; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Differential evaporation; High temperature shape memory alloy; High-temperature shape memory alloys; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Laser power; Powder bed; Printability; Processing parameters; Transformation temperatures; Nickel alloys","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1846676); Schlumberger Foundation, (1849085, NSF-DGE-1545403)","The co-authors thank the support from National Science Foundation (NSF) through Grant No. 1846676.

WAAM systems are increasingly employed in the industry and academia, but there are still several challenges and barriers to process stability control. The process stability is highly dependent on how the molten feed wire is added into the melt pool, which is known as the droplet transfer mode. To ensure a stable WAAM deposition process, it is essential to maintain the transfer mode in a suitable stable status. Without an effective transfer mode control method, the operators need to determine and control the transfer mode based on their experience using manual adjustment, which is difficult to achieve in a long period of production process. In this paper, a deep learning-based technology was proposed for the control of the droplet transfer mode based on the data collected from the WAAM process. A long short term memory neural network was applied as the core transfer mode classification model. A time-series data, arc voltage, was collected and statistical and frequency features were extracted, which included 11 relevant features, as the inputs of the classification model. Then, the distance between the melted wire and the melt pool was adjusted based on the determined transfer mode to keep a suitable stability of the process. A case study was used to evaluate the proposed approach and to show its merit. The proposed approach was compared to three commonly used machine learning algorithms, k-nearest neighbours, support vector machine, and decision tree. The proposed method obtained the highest accuracy in determining the transfer mode, which was over 91%. The performance of the proposed approach was also evaluated by the single-pass and oscillated wall building. The proposed deep learning based approach improved the process stability in real-time, which resulted in better deposition qualities, in terms of geometry size and processing cleanliness compared to without control. Furthermore, this data-driven method could be applied to other WAAM processes and materials. © 2022, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Deposition process stability; Droplet transfer mode; WAAM","Additives; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Deep learning; Deposition; Digital storage; Drops; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Process control; Stability; Support vector machines; Wire; Deep learning; Deposition process stability; Droplet transfer; Droplet transfer mode; Melt pool; Mode-based; Process stability; Transfer modes; Wire + arc additive manufacturing; Wire arc; 3D printers","","","","","","","Abandah G.A., Graves A., Al-Shagoor B., Arabiyat A., Jamour F., Al-Taee M., Automatic diacritization of Arabic text using recurrent neural networks, International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition (IJDAR), 18, 2, pp. 183-197, (2015); Andersen K., Cook G.E., Karsai G., Ramaswamy K., Artificial neural networks applied to arc welding process modeling and control, IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, 26, 5, pp. 824-830, (1990); Asuero A.G., Sayago A., Gonzalez A.G., The correlation coefficient: An overview, Critical Reviews in Analytical Chemistry, 36, 1, pp. 41-59, (2006); Bonaccorso G., Machine learning algorithms, (2017); Charaniya S., Le H., Rangwala H., Mills K., Johnson K., Karypis G., Hu W.S., Mining manufacturing data for discovery of high productivity process characteristics, Journal of Biotechnology, 147, 3-4, pp. 186-197, (2010); Cunningham C.R., Flynn J.M., Shokrani A., Dhokia V., Newman S.T., Invited review article: Strategies and processes for high quality wire arc additive manufacturing, Additive Manufacturing, 22, pp. 672-686, (2018); Desai N., Dhameliya K., Desai V., Feature extraction and classification techniques for speech recognition: A review, International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering, 3, 12, pp. 367-371, (2013); Dilthey U., Fuest D., Scheller W., Laser welding with filler wire, Optical and Quantum Electronics, 27, 12, pp. 1181-1191, (1995); Ding J., Colegrove P., Martina F., Williams S., Wiktorowicz R., Palt M.R., Development of a laminar flow local shielding device for wire+arc additive manufacture, Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 226, pp. 99-105, (2015); Fu T.C., A review on time series data mining, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 24, 1, pp. 164-181, (2011); Gulli A., Pal S., Deep learning with Keras, (2017); Hagqvist P., Heralic A., Christiansson A.-K., Lennartson B., Resistance measurements for control of laser metal wire deposition, Optics and Lasers in Engineering, 54, pp. 62-67, (2014); Hagqvist P., Heralic A., Christiansson A.-K., Lennartson B., Resistance based iterative learning control of additive manufacturing with wire, Mechatronics, 31, pp. 116-123, (2015); Heralic A., Christiansson A.K., Lennartson B., Height control of laser metal-wire deposition based on iterative learning control and 3D scanning, Optics and Lasers in Engineering, 50, 9, pp. 1230-1241, (2012); Hossin M., Sulaiman M.N., A review on evaluation metrics for data classification evaluations, International Journal of Data Mining & Knowledge Management Process, 5, 2, pp. 1-11, (2015); Imanaga S., Haneda M., Shibata N., Kobayashi M., Hino E., Development of torch position control and welding condition control technology for all-position, multi-layer GTA welding.

In this study, in-situ neutron diffraction experiments were conducted on nickel superalloy specimens to understand how mechanical ansitropy and the evolution of internal strains are affected by changing the LPBF-AM parameters. In addition, Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) measurements were performed to characterize the initial microstructure of the specimens. The measured EBSD maps were imported into a crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) model to further study how different AM parameters, specifically laser power and scanning speed, affect the development of internal strains. At higher specific energy (SE) inputs, columnar grains are observed, and samples developed a 〈1 1 0〉 texture along the building direction and a 〈1 0 0〉 texture along the scanning direction, while at lower SEs random texture is observed. The development of texture affects elastic and plastic anisotropy, as well as the development of internal strains in different directions, particularly for the {2 0 0} lattice strains measured in the laser scanning direction. It is shown that (1 1 1) 〈1 1 0〉 slip system is the most active one for the range of applied strains. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; CPFE; EBSD; Laser powder bed fusion; Neutron diffraction","Additives; Anisotropy; Finite element method; Neutron diffraction; Neutrons; Nickel alloys; Scanning; Textures; Crystal plasticity finite element; Deformation mechanism; Electron back scatter diffraction; Electron backscatter diffraction; Internal strains; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Laser scanning; Manufacturing parameters; Powder bed; 3D printers","","","","","; Alliance-Mitacs, (ALLRP 573451-22); ISIS, (EGP/542550-2019)","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge ISIS, ENGIN-X for allocating beamtime to the experiment 2055007.

This allows for a tailored drug dosage specific to the patient with a release profile that offers the optimum therapeutic effect. Coupling this application with medical imaging capabilities, real-time contrast can be viewed to display the interaction with the host. Current approaches towards such novelty produce a drug burst release profile and contrasting agents associated with side effects as a result of poor encapsulation of these components. In this study, a 3D-printed drug delivery matrix with real-time imaging is engineered. Polycaprolactone (PCL) forms the bulk structure and encapsulates tetracycline hydrochloride (TH), an antibiotic drug and Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (IONP, Fe3O4), a superparamagnetic contrasting agent. Hot melt extrusion (HME) coupled with fused deposition modelling (FDM) is utilised to promote the encapsulation of TH and IONP. The effect of additives on the formation of micropores (10–20 µm) on the 3D-printed surface was investigated. The high-resolution process demonstrated successful encapsulation of both bioactive and nano components to present promising applications in drug delivery systems, medical imaging and targeted therapy. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing; control release; CT imaging; encapsulation; micropore","3D printers; Additives; Computerized tomography; Controlled drug delivery; Diagnosis; Drug dosage; Medical imaging; Melt spinning; Microporosity; Real time systems; Targeted drug delivery; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Control release; CT imaging; Drug-delivery systems; Imaging capabilities; Micropores; Real- time; Realtime imaging; Release profiles; Magnetite","","","","","","","Nelson K.D., Absorbable, Drug-Loaded, Extruded Fiber for Implantation, Biomedical Textiles for Orthopaedic and Surgical Applications, pp. 119-143, (2015); Cano-Vicent A., Tambuwala M.M., Hassan S.S., Barh D., Aljabali A.A.A., Birkett M., Arjunan A., Serrano-Aroca A., Fused Deposition Modelling: Current Status, Methodology, Applications and Future Prospects, Addit.

Conventional 3D-printed tissues are limited in their ability to alter the fate of laden cells. Specifically, the efficient delivery of gene expression regulators (i.e. microRNAs (miRNAs)) to cells in bioprinted tissues has remained largely elusive. In this study, we explored the inclusion of extracellular vesicles (EVs), naturally occurring nanovesicles (NVs), into bioinks to resolve this challenge. EVs show excellent biocompatibility, rapid endocytosis, and low immunogenicity, which lead to the efficient delivery of miRNAs without measurable cytotoxicity. EVs were fused with liposomes to prolong and control their release by altering their physical interaction with the bioink. Hybrid EVs-liposome (hEL) NVs were embedded in gelatin-based hydrogels to create bioinks that could efficiently encapsulate and deliver miRNAs at the target site in a controlled and sustained manner. The regulation of cells’ gene expression in a 3D bioprinted matrix was achieved using the hELs-laden bioink as a precursor for excellent shape fidelity and high cell viability constructs. Novel regulatory factors-loaded bioinks will expedite the translation of new bioprinting applications in the tissue engineering field. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.","3D bioprinting; bioink; extracellular vesicles; liposomes; microRNAs; tissue regeneration","Bioprinting; Extracellular Vesicles; Hydrogels; Liposomes; MicroRNAs; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; 3D printers; Biocompatibility; Cytology; Gene expression; Histology; Liposomes; RNA; Tissue; liposome; microRNA; 3d bioprinting; Bioink; Bioprinting; Complex architectures; Extracellular; Extracellular vesicle; Genes expression; Living tissues; Microrna; Nanovesicle; bioprinting; exosome; genetics; hydrogel; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; Tissue regeneration","","Hydrogels, ; Liposomes, ; MicroRNAs, ","","","Brigham Research Institute Innovation Evergreen Fund; Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia, (325); National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01AR074234, R21EB026824); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS, (R01AR077132); National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS; American Heart Association, AHA, (19IPLOI34660079); American Heart Association, AHA; International Educational Foundation, IEF; Ministry of Education, MOE, (NRF-2021R1A6A3A14039720); Ministry of Education, MOE; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Ministère de l'Enseignement supérieur, de la Recherche et de l'Innovation","This paper was funded by AHA Innovative Project Award (19IPLOI34660079), the National Institutes of Health (R01AR074234, R21EB026824, R01AR077132), the Gillian Reny Stepping Strong Center for Trauma Innovation and the Brigham Research Institute Innovation Evergreen Fund (IEF) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.

The microstructural characterization and grain structure observations of the fabricated samples are conducted using electron microscopies and electron backscatter diffraction. It is observed that by altering the building orientation from vertical to horizontal, the morphology of the grains changes from columnar-dendritic to equiaxed. In addition, a higher volume fraction of austenite is retained in the horizontal sample compared with the vertically printed sample due to a faster cooling rate, higher degree of micro-segregation, and smaller prior austenite grains. Consequently, a higher strength and better ductility are achieved in the horizontally printed sample.

High-performance polymers are the key to mold production for prototypes and small series. However, the high temperatures during vulcanization injection molding cause thermal aging and can impair service life. The extent to which the thermal stress over the entire process chain stresses the material and whether it leads to irreversible material aging is evaluated. To this end, a mold made of PEEK is fabricated using fused filament fabrication and examined for its potential application. The mold is heated to 200 °C, filled with rubber, and cured. A differential scanning calorimetry analysis of each process step illustrates the crystallization behavior and first indicates the material resistance. It shows distinct cold crystallization regions at a build chamber temperature of 90 °C. At an ambient temperature above Tg, crystallization of 30% is achieved, and cold crystallization no longer occurs. Additional tensile tests show a decrease in tensile strength after ten days of thermal aging. The steady decrease in recrystallization temperature indicates degradation of the additives. However, the tensile tests reveal steady embrittlement of the material due to increasing crosslinking. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; crystallization; direct tooling; fused filament fabrication; high-performance polymers; PEEK; polyetheretherketone; polymer degradation; rapid tooling; rubber molding","","","","","","University of Applied Sciences FH Aachen","Funded by the University of Applied Sciences FH Aachen.","Gebhardt A., Hotter J.-S., Additive Manufacturing: 3D Printing for Prototyping and Manufacturing, (2016); Kovacs J.G., Szabo F., Kovacs N.K., Suplicz A., Zink B., Tabi T., Hargitai H., Thermal simulations and measurements for rapid tool inserts in injection molding applications, Appl.

Initial research has addressed the influence of process-induced imperfections in lattices, but so far numerical work for TPMS lattices is insufficient. Therefore, in the present study, the structure–property relationships of TPMS lattices, including their imperfections, are investigated experimentally and numerically. The main focus is on a biomimetic Schoen I-WP network lattice made of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) processed Ti-42Nb designed for bone tissue engineering (BTE). The lattice is scanned by computed tomography (CT) and its as-built morphology is examined before a modeling procedure for artificial reconstruction is developed. The structure–property relationships are analyzed by experimental and numerical compression tests. An anisotropic elastoplastic material model is parameterized for finite element analyses (FEA). The numerical results indicates that the reconstruction of the as-built morphology decisively improves the prediction accuracy compared to the ideal design. This work highlights the central importance of process-related imperfections for the structure–property relationships of TPMS lattices and proposes a modeling procedure to capture their implications. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; Defect modeling; Lattice structures; Manufacturing defects; Structure–property relationship; Triply periodic minimal surfaces","3D printers; Additives; Binary alloys; Biomimetics; Compression testing; Computerized tomography; Industrial research; Morphology; Niobium alloys; Structural properties; Tissue engineering; Titanium alloys; Defect model; Laser powders; Lattice structures; Lattice-based; Manufacturing defects; Manufacturing IS; Modeling procedure; Structure-properties relationships; Surface lattice; Triply periodic minimal surfaces; Defects","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (419952351, GE/1106/12–1, ZI/1006/16–1)","Acknowledgement is made for the funding by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) within the research projects ZI/1006/16–1 and GE/1106/12–1 (No. 419952351).

Therefore, understanding the quasi-static behaviour of this alloy manufactured by an additive manufacturing process is paramount. This paper documents an investigation of the quasi-static mechanical properties of various microstructures of heat-treated Ti6Al4V(ELI) parts manufactured by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). The effects of different quasi-static strain rates on different microstructures of these samples and their strain hardening are also presented. The test samples were produced using an EOSINT M280 direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) machine and, thereafter, subdivided into three major groups, namely samples C, D and E, for high-temperature annealing at different heat treatment strategies. A universal hydraulic testing machine (UTM) was used to carry out tests at strain rates of 0.001 s−1, 0.005 s−1 and 0.1 s−1. The three forms of LPBF Ti6Al4V(ELI) were found to be sensitive to quasi-static strain rate, whereby values of yield and flow stresses in each form of alloy increased with increasing strain rate. The order of the strength at each strain rate from the highest to the lowest was found to be samples C, D and E. The effects of strain rate on flow hardening were found to be significant in samples C and insignificant in samples D and E. © 2022 by the authors.","DMLS; flow stress; micro-texture; microstructure; quasi-static; strain rate; Ti6Al4V(ELI); yield stress","","","","","","Department of Science and Innovation, South Africa, DSI; Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India, CSIR, (NLC-CPAM-21-MOA-CUT-01); Defence Science Institute, DSI","This research was funded by the South African Department of Science and Innovation (DSI) through the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), for the Collaborative Program in Additive Manufacturing, Contract No.: CSIR -NLC-CPAM-21-MOA-CUT-01.","Liu R., Wang Z., Sparks T., Liou F., Newkirk J., Aerospace applications of laser additive manufacturing, Laser Additive Manufacturing, pp. 351-371, (2017); Gorse S., Hutchinson C., Gounce M., Banarjee R., Additive manufacturing of metals: A brief review of the characteristic microstructures and properties of steels, Ti6Al4V and high entropy alloys, STAM, 18, pp. 584-610, (2017); Rafi H.K., Karthik N.V., Gong H., Starr T., Brent S., Microstructures and mechanical properties of Ti6Al4V parts fabricated by selective laser melting and electron beam melting, J.

Cylindrical test specimens were produced by selective laser melting from Ti6Al4V powder material with different processing parameters. The aim of postprocessing was modification of shape accuracy. Sliding friction diamond burnishing was applied as the postprocessing method. A five-factor, two-level full factorial design of experiment was implemented with factors being infill laser power, infill laser scan speed, burnishing speed, feed and force. Improvement ratios of two roundness parameters were defined, calculated from experimental data, and studied by main effect and interaction analysis. It has been demonstrated that burnishing feed has the largest main effect to improvement in roundness total and cylindricity. Additionally, parameters of both selective laser melting and diamond burnishing appear in three largest interaction terms. Empirical functions were fit to measurement data. Results show that improvement in roundness parameters are strongly nonlinear functions of all factors. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; diamond burnishing; postprocessing; selective laser melting; shape accuracy; Ti6Al4V","","","","","","National Research, Development, (GINOP-2.2.1-15-2017-00055); Nemzeti Kutatási, Fejlesztési és Innovaciós Alap, NKFIA","Funding text 1: Project no.

In the present work, Binder Jet 3D-printed Invar36 alloy parts’ surface quality improvement is studied. Invar36 is a Fe–Ni alloy which presents near zero coefficient of thermal expansion below its curie temperature (279 °C) and it is widely used for high precision instrumentation in space environment. D90 < 22 µm grade Invar36 powder was used and printing process parameters were optimized following the Taguchi DoE methodology, to reduce sintered parts’ surface roughness. Additional sandblasting and electropolishing operations were performed and part surface roughness was reduced from 5 µm Ra to 1.5 µm Ra. Near surface closed porosity emerged and enlarged during the electropolishing process, leaving a non-homogeneous surface appearance. Consequently, a Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) thermal treatment was applied to reduce part overall and near-surface porosity, reaching a relative density of 99.8%. After the sandblasting and electropolishing of HIP-ed parts, surface roughness was further reduced to 1 µm Ra maintaining and homogeneous and clean surface. The results of the study showed that Binder Jet 3D-printed Invar36 parts with low surface roughness can be obtained, getting this process and material closer to future space optics developments. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Additive manufacturing; Binder jetting; Electropolishing; Invar36; Space; Surface porosity; Surface roughness","","","","","","Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU, (EXP-00137314/ CER-20191003); Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU; Eusko Jaurlaritza, (KK-2018/00115); Eusko Jaurlaritza","This article was funded by Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades (Grant nos: SURF-ERA, EXP-00137314/ CER-20191003, M.

The framework unifies a tailored acquisition function, a parallel acquisition procedure, and the integration of process information providing context to the optimization procedure. The novel acquisition function is demonstrated, analyzed and compared on state-of-the-art benchmarking problems. We apply the optimization approach to atmospheric plasma spraying and fused deposition modeling. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework can efficiently find input parameters that produce the desired outcome and minimize the process cost. © 2016 IEEE.","Bayesian optimization; intelligent and flexible manufacturing; machine learning for control; probability and statistical methods; process control","Plasma jets; Plasma spraying; Statistical process control; Advanced manufacturing; Bayesian optimization; Information providing; Intelligent and flexible manufacturing; Machine learning for control; Machine-learning; Manufacturing methods; Parallel acquisition; Probability and statistical method; Process information; Learning systems","","","","","","","Dey A., Yodo N., A systematic survey of FDM process parameter optimization and their influence on part characteristics, J.

An experimental investigation was conducted to determine the main machining parameters which contribute to particle size (PS) and size distribution (SD) in WEDM of bronze. Five factors, including three-level built-in processing patterns, wire speed and dielectric medium, are selected as control parameters using an orthogonal array L16(45) Taguchi method, PS and SD of produced powders are the measure of quality. The goal is to obtain micron-scale spherical metal powder with uniform particle size. Results show that cutting-section pattern is the most significant factor, and the electrolyte is the least. The PS and SD performance of the optimized powders is significantly improved by using Taguchi method. Spherical bronze powder with particle size of d10 11.05 μm, d50 31.13 μm and d90 67.48 μm are prepared using the optimized WEDM process parameter, which is A3–B4–C3–D1–E1 including dielectric medium water, cutting class 4, cutting division 3, cutting Sect. 1 and wire speed 200 μm/s. The research confirms that WEDM can be used to produce micron-scale metallic powders, providing cheap and high-quality metallic powders for the metal additive manufacturing industry. © 2022, The Author(s).","Bronze powder; Micron-scale; Taguchi method; WEDM","Bronze; Electric discharge machining; Electric discharges; Electrolytes; Industrial research; Metal cutting; Metals; Powder metals; Taguchi methods; Bronze powders; Dielectric medium; Experimental investigations; Metallic powder; Micron scale; Particles sizes; Process parameters; Size and size distributions; Taguchi's methods; WEDM; Particle size","","","","","Government of Guangdong Province; Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2019B90907002)","This work was supported by: Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province (2019B90907002).
