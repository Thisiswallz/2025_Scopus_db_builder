The use of monolithic shaped materials allows a process with a lower pressure drop than traditionally packed beds, increasing the energy efficiency of the process. Additive manufacturing is an alternative for developing hierarchically structured adsorbent materials with improved geometries. In this study, the potential of a hybrid monolith with electrically conductive properties was assessed for CO2capture by applying an Electrical Swing Adsorption process. The monolith was obtained by direct ink writing. In addition to the zeolite 13X (47.5 %wt.), activated carbon (47.5 %wt.) was used to provide electrical conductivity to the material. Carboxymethylcellulose was used as a binder/plasticizer to assist in writing and provide mechanical stability. The properties of the monolith were analyzed by several techniques and were compared with its raw adsorbent materials. CO2and N2adsorption equilibrium properties and the adsorption dynamics were also evaluated to test the performance of the monolith in capturing CO2. During these tests, electrification to regenerate the structured adsorbent was used. Considering a stream with a molar fraction of 0.15 of CO2 and 0.85 of N2 at 1 bar, the monolith presents a CO2/N2selectivity of 30.7. The application of electric current increased the monolith temperature due to the Joule heating effect and demonstrated the efficiency in achieving a faster regeneration of the adsorbent. The cyclic stability of the monolith was also evaluated in this work. This study proves the potential of using direct ink writing to produce structured adsorbent materials for CO2capture using an electric swing adsorption process. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Activated carbon; Adsorption; CO<sub>2</sub> capture; Direct ink writing; Structured adsorbent; Zeolite 13X","3D printers; Activated carbon; Adsorption; Energy efficiency; Mechanical stability; Packed beds; Zeolites; Adsorbent materials; Adsorption capacities; Adsorption process; Carbon material; CO2 capture; Direct ink writing; Hybrid zeolites; Structured adsorbents; Swing adsorption; Zeolite 13X; Carbon dioxide","","","","","Norte Portugal Regional Operational Programme; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT; Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior, MCTES, (NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000077); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000054)","This work was financially supported by LA/P/0045/2020 (ALiCE), UIDB/50020/2020 and UIDP/50020/2020 (LSRE-LCM), funded by national funds through FCT/MCTES (PIDDAC); project HyGreen&LowEmissions, with reference NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000077, through the Programa Operacional Regional do Norte (NORTE 2020), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); and project 2SMART (NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000054), supported by Norte Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE 2020), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).

Decellularized cartilage extracellular matrix (dCECM) derived from natural cartilage, and the incorporated growth factors have been used for potential chondrocyte induction and cartilage tissue regeneration. Moreover, infrapatellar fat pad adipose-derived stem cells (IPFP-ADSCs) have been proven to be an optimal source of seeded cells for AC lesion restoration. Therefore, the therapeutic role of dCECM-incorporated bioink with IPFP-ADSCs loaded in 3D (three-dimensional) scaffolds remain to be explored using an osteochondral defect model. In this work, we successfully extracted IPFP-ADSCs and isolated dCECMs, which were then mixed in a temperature-responsive hydrogel to form a 3D bioink. The 3D bioprinting scaffolds printed with dCECM successfully facilitated chondrogenic differentiation-related growth factor expression in IPFP-ADSCs. Most importantly, implantation of the 3D dCECMs with an IPFP-ADSC-loaded scaffold was capable of providing a favorable cell matrix for stem cell proliferation and promoted chondrogenic differentiation, thereby greatly enhancing successful cartilage repair in rabbit cartilage defects. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D bioprinted scaffold; Articular cartilage; Chondrogenic differentiation; Decellularized extracellular matrix; Infrapatellar fat pad adipose-derived stem cells","3D printers; Cartilage; Cell proliferation; Defects; Hydrogels; Repair; Scaffolds (biology); Tissue regeneration; 3d bioprinted scaffold; Adipose derived stem cells; Articular cartilages; Cartilage extracellular matrixes; Chondrogenic differentiation; Decellularized; Decellularized extracellular matrix; Extracellular matrices; Growth factor; Infrapatellar fat pad adipose-derived stem cell; Stem cells","","","","","Three-Year Action Plan for Talent Construction of Shanghai Changzheng Hospital; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFC1103404); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Project of China (2017YFC1103404) and Three-Year Action Plan for Talent Construction of Shanghai Changzheng Hospital - Pyramid Talent Project.

The immiscible W phase and Cu/α-Cu phases were prone to separate during LPBF. The melted W phase could easily fuse together and form W matrix, and Cu or α-Cu phase distributed within the gaps among W phase. Cu or α-Cu phase can provide a gradient cooling way for the solidification of W phase through the transformation of ‘solid-liquid-gas’ during LPBF. The evaporation of Cu or Sn accelerated the heat dissipation, which caused the grain refinement of W. Higher thermal conductivity of Cu than α-Cu leads to the relative finer grain size of W phase in W-Cu composite. The heat conduction direction between W phase and Cu/α-Cu also affected the grain morphology. Heat continued transferred from W to Cu/α-Cu induced the columnar grain growth of W, the interlacing distribution of W and Cu/α-Cu made the growth of W columnar grains radiate out from the center Cu/α-Cu phase. Remarkable, cracks were severely restrained in W phase simultaneously although W phase melted completely. This is not only related to improvement of strength and ductility of W caused by grain refinement, but also because of the interlacing distribution of W and Cu/α-Cu phases, which could effectively reduce the stress degree in W phase during LBPF. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Grain refinement; Immiscible second phases; Laser powder bed fusion; W matrix; W-based composites","","","","","","National Key Laboratory Foundation of Science and Technology on Materials, (6142902210105); Natural Science Fund for Innovative Research Groups, (51621003); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFC1901701); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","The present work is supported by financial supports by National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2018YFC1901701 ), National Key Laboratory Foundation of Science and Technology on Materials under Shock and Impact (No. 6142902210105 ), and Natural Science Fund for Innovative Research Groups (Grant No. 51621003 ).","Zhang Q., Chen B., Chen Z., Zhu Z., Hu X., Ding Y., Liang S., Microstructure and properties of W Cu composites reinforced by in-situ generated WC, Int.

The effect of notch orientation (parallel and orthogonal in reference to build direction) on FCG and fracture toughness is investigated. The FCG and fracture toughness data of L-PBF specimens in the solution annealed (SA) and SA + aged condition were compared to that of wrought 15-5 PH SS. It was found that dependence of FCG on the build orientation was insignificant up to the stress intensity factor range (ΔK) of 30 MPa√m, and beyond that, a higher FCG rate is recorded for L-PBF specimens. The SA specimens were found to have a slightly lower FCG rate at Paris region as compared to SA + aged specimens. The fractography showed predominantly transgranular mode of crack growth, with presence of fine pores and signature of plastic deformation at higher stress intensity. The crack branching and zig-zag path was observed for the L-PBF specimens with notch orientation orthogonal to build direction (horizontal notch). The fracture toughness (K1C) of horizontally notched L-PBF fabricated 15-5 PH SS specimens in aged condition showed higher values (51–62 MPa√m) as compared to vertical (parallel) notched specimens (40–46 MPa√m). The observed fracture toughness values of L-PBF 15-5 PH SS specimens appear to be significantly lower than the reported fracture toughness values of wrought 15-5 PH SS material. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","15-5 PH Stainless steel; Additive manufacturing; Build orientation; Fatigue crack growth rate; Fracture toughness; Laser powder bed fusion; Paris law; Retained austenite","3D printers; Additives; Age hardening; Fabrication; Fatigue crack propagation; Growth rate; Hardness; Textures; 15-5 precipitation hardening stainless steel; Build orientation; Fatigue crack growth rates; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Paris' law; Powder bed; Precipitation-hardening stainless steel; Retained austenite; Solution-annealed; Fracture toughness","","","","","Department of Heavy Industry; Mechanical Engineering Dept.

The innovative structures are composed of short triangular channels, the walls of which are similar to an airfoil profile. The structures were made using additive manufacturing method – selective laser melting (SLM) - in three different lengths. The study includes flow resistance and heat transfer, both realized using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling and experimentally. Flow resistance was measured by precise micromanometer over a wide range of gas velocities. During heat transfer experiments, electric current flowing through the metal structures heated them (Joule effect). The experimental results are in acceptable agreement with the CFD taking into account the accuracy of the structures' manufactured. The novel structures display improved heat transfer properties compared to monoliths and satisfactory low pressure drop. The flow patterns modelled using CFD prove that the inlet vortex has completely disappeared and the outlet vortex is significantly reduced compared to classic monolithic structures. The novel structure studied here is a promising prospect for the development of catalytic reactors. © 2022","Airfoil-shaped walls; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Flow resistance; Heat transfer; Short-channel structures","Airfoils; Heat transfer; Selective laser melting; Transport properties; Vortex flow; Airfoil-shaped wall; Catalytic carriers; Channel structures; Enhanced transports; Flow resistance; Innovative structures; Novel structures; Short channels; Short-channel structure; Triangular channel; Computational fluid dynamics","","","","","Narodowe Centrum Nauki, NCN, (DEC-2016/21/B/ST8/00496)","This work was supported by the research grants from Polish National Science Centre (Project DEC-2016/21/B/ST8/00496).","pp. 585-602, (1999); Turner M.C., Andersen Z.J., Baccarelli A., Diver W.R., Gapstur S.M., Pope C.A., Prada D., Samet J., Thurston G., Cohen A., Outdoor air pollution and cancer: An overview of the current evidence and public health recommendations, Ca-a Cancer Journal for Clinicians, 70, 6, pp. 460-479, (2020); Omidi Khaniabadi Y., Sicard P., Omidi Khaniabadi A., Mohammadinejad S., Keishams F., Takdastan A., Najafi A., De Marco A., Daryanoosh M., Air quality modeling for health risk assessment of ambient PM 10, PM 2.5 and SO 2 in Iran, Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal, 25, 5, pp. 1298-1310, (2019); Cohen A.J., Brauer M., Burnett R., Anderson H.R., Frostad J., Estep K., Balakrishnan K., Brunekreef B., Dandona L., Dandona R., Feigin V., Freedman G., Hubbell B., Jobling A., Kan H., Knibbs L., Liu Y., Martin R., Morawska L., Pope C.A., Shin H., Straif K., Shaddick G., Thomas M., van Dingenen R., van Donkelaar A., Vos T., Murray C.J.L., Forouzanfar M.H., Estimates and 25-year trends of the global burden of disease attributable to ambient air pollution: an analysis of data from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2015, Lancet, 389, 10082, pp. 1907-1918, (2017); Boningari T., Smirniotis P.G., Impact of nitrogen oxides on the environment and human health: Mn-based materials for the NOx abatement, Curr.

Though demand for increased energy density with mechanical stability continues to be strong, attempts to use traditional ink-casting to increase electrode thickness or geometric complexity have had limited success. Here, we combined a nanomaterial orientation with 3D printing and developed a dry electrode processing route, structured electrode additive manufacturing (SEAM), to rapidly fabricate thick electrodes with an out-of-plane aligned architecture with low tortuosity and mechanical robustness. SEAM uses a shear flow of molten feedstock to control the orientation of the anisotropic materials across nano to macro scales, favoring Li-ion transport and insertion. These structured electrodes with 1 mm thickness have more than twice the specific capacity at 1 C compared to slurry-cast electrodes and have higher mechanical properties (compressive strength of 0.84 MPa and modulus of 5 MPa) than other reported 3D-printed electrodes. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

However, the porosity formation mechanisms have not been fully clarified. In particular, the formation of small pores in fabricated parts from the gas among granules is controversial. The existence of sharp corners among molten granules is a key numerical challenge because the conventional diffusive interface model (DIM) might trigger spurious gas entrapment. To solve the problem, a quasi-sharp-interface model (QSIM) was proposed for the moving particle semi-implicit (MPS) method in this study. A new approach to calculate the interface area based on the local triangularization was proposed to accurately impose the surface-tension force in the QSIM. The bubble-rising simulation verified the capability of the QSIM to simulate topological changes of interfaces. The sharp-corner deformation problem demonstrated that the QSIM could effectively prevent unphysical breakup and the spurious gas entrapment. Thus, the QSIM was indispensable for reliably simulating the gas entrapment from the gaps among granules in SLM. Finally, the QSIM results indicated that the gas among granules was completely discharged when the granules melted. This suggested that the gas among granules did not cause small pores in the fabricated parts. This observation correlated with an experimental composition analysis of gas in pores. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Multiphase flow; Particle method; Porosity; Selective laser melting; Sharp-interface method","Granulation; Melting; Numerical methods; Particles (particulate matter); Phase interfaces; Porosity; Selective laser melting; Fabricated parts; Gas entrapments; Metal additives; Numerical investigations; Particle methods; Selective laser melting; Sharp corners; Sharp interface; Sharp interface methods; Sharp interface model; Gases","","","","","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT, (JPMXS0118067246); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT","This research was supported by MEXT Quantum Leap Flagship Program (MEXT Q-LEAP) with Grant No. JPMXS0118067246 .","Sola A., Nouri A., Microstructural porosity in additive manufacturing: the formation and detection of pores in metal parts fabricated by powder bed fusion, J.

Structured packings manufactured with triply periodical minimum surfaces (TPMS) have good mixing properties and enhanced thermal transport, but they do not have high surface areas. In this work, we report a new type of hybrid TPMS structure with high surface area while keeping good mixing properties. The new shapes are made by generating solids on the boundaries of a 2D tessellation of polygons over the TPMS surface. The new shapes have a higher surface area than a TPMS and at the same time, a higher porosity. We have evaluated the pressure drop and heat transfer properties of such structures for Reynolds numbers 1-200 in 10 different solids. The results indicate that pressure drop is dominated by porosity. Heat transfer properties however depend also on available surface area and thus are improved in the porous structures. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Hardness and surface roughness of the specimens at different orientations were measured. Tensile testing together with digital image correlation technique were conducted on the specimens. XY specimens showed the highest yield stress and ultimate tensile strength while XZ specimens showed the highest ductility. Hardness measurements for different specimens were in accordance with the tensile test results, following the same order as the UTS values, XY specimens being the highest and XY-45° (out-of-plane) specimens being the lowest. Fractography of the broken surfaces of the specimens under tensile testing revealed the microstructural features and various defects in the tensile fracture. The anisotropy in mechanical properties is attributed to the microstructural anisotropy as well as presence of various types of defects induced by the AM process, which affects the deformation and failure mechanism of the parts. Linear relationships between experimental Vickers hardness versus yield stress and UTS measurements were developed. In case of material selection for different applications, these relationships can be used as a simple tool for converting hardness and yield stress (or UTS) values to each other. An equivalent strain-hardness relationship was also proposed which can be used for health monitoring of parts subject to tensile loading. © 2022 The Authors","Defects; Hardness; Laser powder bed fusion; Mechanical properties; Microstructure","Anisotropy; Ductility; Failure (mechanical); Fracture mechanics; Fracture testing; Image correlation; Materials testing apparatus; Surface roughness; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Vickers hardness; Vickers hardness testing; Digital image correlation technique; Hardness measurement; Higher yield; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Microstructural features; Out-of-plane; Powder bed; Strength and ductilities; Ultimate tensile strength; Yield stress","","","","","","","Wood P., Libura T., Kowalewski Z.L., Williams G., Serjouei A., Influences of horizontal and vertical build orientations and post-fabrication processes on the fatigue behavior of stainless steel 316L produced by selective laser melting, Materials, 12, 24, (2019); Grbovic A.M., Rasuo B.P., Vidanovic N.D., Peric M.M., Simulation of crack propagation in titanium mini dental implants (MDI), FME Trans, 39, 4, pp. 165-170, (2011); Kastratovic G., Vidanovic N., Grbovic A., Rasuo B., Approximate determination of stress intensity factor for multiple surface cracks, FME Trans, 46, 1, pp. 39-45, (2018); Grbovic A., Rasuo B., FEM based fatigue crack growth predictions for spar of light aircraft under variable amplitude loading, Eng.

Guided bone regeneration (GBR) is an effective and widely used method to solve this problem. Titanium mesh with good 3D space maintenance ability shows excellent effect in the assistance of GBR. Unfortunately, such metal mesh needs to be removed by secondary operation, and the exposure after operation can't be completely avoided. Thus, it is a big challenge to repair the alveolar bone defects with different shapes and sizes by customization. Herein, the wollastonite bioceramics without and with 6% magnesium doping (CSi, CSi-Mg6) were prepared to fabricate the macroporous dome-like meshes with different CSi/CSi-Mg6 mass ratio (0:100, 16:84, 32:68) via digital light processing-based 3D printing (DLP) technique. The mechanical parameters, biodegradable rate and osteogenic stem cell viability in vitro of the bioceramic scaffolds with different morphologies were also evaluated systematically. The macroporous bioceramic dome- or titanium mesh-assisted osteogenic potentials in the calcined bone granules were evaluated in the rabbit calvarial bone defect models. The experimental results showed that the scaffolds with 16%CSi exhibited satisfactory mechanical properties and promoted the proliferation and differentiation of osteogenic stem cells. The bioactive domes displayed significantly higher osteostimulate activity than the metal mesh in the calcined bone mineral granule systems. The appreciable CSi-Mg6 content (≥84%) in the dome scaffolds could maintain the porous structures after 16 weeks of implantation, and especially the presence of 16% CSi in the bioceramic dome may greatly balance the scaffold biodegradation and restoration treatment. Totally, the 3D printed nonstoichiometric wollastonite-based scaffolds are expected to be the promising candidates to replace titanium mesh in GBR. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Biodegradation; Digital light processing; Guided bone regeneration; Magnesium doped wollastonite; Titanium mesh","3D printers; Bone; Calcination; Domes; Granulation; Magnesium; Magnesium compounds; Melting; Mesh generation; Mineralogy; Scaffolds; Scaffolds (biology); Silicate minerals; Spheres; Alveolar bones; Bone loss; Calcined bone; Digital light processing; Guided bone regeneration; Macroporous; Magnesium doped wollastonite; Metal-mesh; Osteogenic; Titanium meshes; Biodegradation","","","","","Educational Reform Project of School Medicine of Zhejiang University, (jgyb20202049); Key Research and Development Program of Science and Technology Department of Zhejiang Province, (2019C03081); Zhejiang Provincial Basic Research for Public Welfare Funds, (LGF22E030002); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81871775, 81902225); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LZ22E020002); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFE0117700); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","Authors would like to acknowledge financial support from Zhejiang Provincial Basic Research for Public Welfare Funds ( LGF22E030002 ), Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China ( LZ22E020002 ), the Key Research and Development Program of Science and Technology Department of Zhejiang Province ( 2019C03081 ), the Educational Reform Project of School Medicine of Zhejiang University ( jgyb20202049 ), the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2017YFE0117700 ), and National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 81871775 , 81902225 ).

Traditional 2D culture methods are not inherently scalable due to cost, space, and handling constraints. Here, the suspension culture of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived aggregates (hAs) is optimized using an automated 250 mL stirred tank bioreactor system. Cell yield, aggregate morphology, and pluripotency marker expression are maintained over three serial passages in two distinct cell lines. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the same optimized parameters can be scaled to an automated 1 L stirred tank bioreactor system. This 4-day culture results in a 16.6- to 20.4-fold expansion of cells, generating approximately 4 billion cells per vessel, while maintaining >94% expression of pluripotency markers. The pluripotent aggregates can be subsequently differentiated into derivatives of the three germ layers, including cardiac aggregates, and vascular, cortical and intestinal organoids. Finally, the aggregates are compacted into a wholly cellular bioink for rheological characterization and 3D bioprinting. The printed hAs are subsequently differentiated into neuronal and vascular tissue. This work demonstrates an optimized suspension culture-to-3D bioprinting pipeline that enables a sustainable approach to billion cell-scale organ engineering. © 2022 The Authors.

The microstructures and mechanical properties of the as-printed and heat-treated cemented carbide specimens were investigated in detail. The formation mechanisms and control method of the microstructural defects in LPBF printed cemented carbides were proposed. A number of particles of 2.5 nm-2.0 μm formed in WC grains after heat-treatment. The nano-sized particles have a coherent interface with the WC matrix. The formation mechanisms of the particles and their effect on the enhancement of mechanical properties of the cemented carbides were demonstrated. Furthermore, the cutting performance of the LPBF printed cemented carbides inserts was tested under actual working conditions, which exhibited excellent service properties and promising application prospects. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Cemented carbides inserts; Cutting performance; Laser powder bed fusion; Mechanical properties; Nanoparticles","Carbide tools; Cobalt compounds; Cutting tools; Heat treatment; Mechanisms; Microstructure; Particle size; Carbide inserts; Cemented carbide insert; Cemented carbides; Cutting performance; Formation mechanism; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Mechanical performance; Powder bed; WC-Co cemented carbide; Carbides","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51621003, 52101032, 52171061, 92163107); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (2202011); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFB3501502, 2022YFB3708800)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 92163107 , 52171061 , 52101032 , and 51621003 ), the National Key R&D Program of China ( 2021YFB3501502 , 2022YFB3708800 ), and the Beijing Natural Science Foundation ( 2202011 ).","Romanova V., Zinovieva O., Balokhonov R., Dymnich E., Moskvichev E., Filippov A., Lychagin D., Effects of the grain shape and crystallographic texture on the grain-scale mechanical behavior of additively manufactured aluminum alloys, Addit.

The as-cast alloy comprised of primary dendritic phase and eutectic region between the FCC and Laves phase. The additive thermal cycle generated by the analytical model was used for phase-field and physical simulations. A thermomechanical simulator was used to perform the physical simulation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the effect of AM on the thermal cycle of the test samples and the results showed that the sigma phase was formed in the primary dendritic phase. The formation of the sigma phase was correlated with thermodynamic predictions and heat treatment studies. The thermal cycle of the microstructure, which was predicted using the phase-field simulation, was correlated with the experimental results. The integrated approach that was adopted in the current study can be utilized for the accelerated exploration of alloys for additive manufacturing. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Eutectic high entropy alloy; Phase-field simulation; Physical simulation; Thermal cycle","3D printers; Additives; Entropy; Heat treatment; High-entropy alloys; Microstructure; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermal cycling; As cast alloy; Dendritic phase; Eutectic high entropy alloy; High entropy alloys; Manufacturing conditions; Phase-field simulation; Physical simulation; Sigma phase; Thermal; Thermal cycle; Eutectics","","","","","","","DebRoy T., Wei H.L., Zuback J.S., Mukherjee T., Elmer J.W., Milewski J.O., Beese A.M., Wilson-Heid A., De A., Zhang W., Additive manufacturing of metallic components – process, structure and properties, Prog.

A significant problem of 3D-printed parts manufactured by AM-FFF is the anisotropy of their mechanical properties. Thus, it is of great importance to understand the impact of the build strategy of the mechanical properties and failure mechanisms of AM-FFF ABS components. This research aims, at least partly, to fill this gap by studying the structure and mechanical behavior by performing fracture surface analysis of AM-FFF ABS specimens under the three-point bend test. For this purpose, three build orientations (flat, on-edge and upright), each built at 0°/90° and-45°/+45° raster angles and oblique printed samples (0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, and 75°) built at-45°/+45° raster angles were prepared. The results revealed that the build direction with the lowest density, the flexural modulus of elasticity, flexural strength, and deflection was in the upright direction for both 0°/90° and-45°/+45° raster orientations. Overall, two main failure modes were observed for the tested specimens: (1) inter-layer/inter-raster bond failure, which is the main contributor to failure of all upright samples and (2) intra-layer/trans-raster failure, which is the main contributor to failure of flat and on-edge specimens printed at-45°/+45° raster orientation. The results of the oblique printed samples demonstrate that a single crack initiation can transform into a few inter-laminar and intra-laminar fracture surfaces due to competing stress fields and structural gradients. © Galati University Press, 2022.","ABS polymer; additive manufacturing; fractography and structure visualization; fused filament fabrication; mechanical properties; three-point bend test","","","","","","Afeka Academic College of Engineering; School of Mechanical Engineering, Tel Aviv University; School of Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University, ME; University of Haifa","The authors would like to thank A.

Moreover, the potential of the additively manufactured BMG Zr59.3Cu28.8Al10.4Nb1.5(trade name AMLOY-ZR01) as an implant material was studied by evaluating the osteoblastic cell response to the alloy and its stability under simulated biological environments. The materials were characterized in terms of degree of crystallinity, surface roughness, and morphology, followed by a systematic investigation of the response of the MC3T3-E1 preosteoblastic cell line to the as-printed samples. The materials supported cell proliferation and differentiation of the preosteoblastic cells, with results comparable to the reference material Ti-6Al-4V. The surface microroughness and surface morphology (porous or groove-type laser tracks) investigated in this study did not have a significant effect on modulating the cell response. Ion release experiments showed a large increase in ion release under inflammatory conditions as compared to regular physiological conditions, which could be attributed to the increased local corrosion under inflammatory conditions. The findings in this work showed that the surface roughness of the additively manufactured BMG AMLOY-ZR01 can be tailored by controlling the laser power applied during the SLM process. The favorable cell response to the as-printed AMLOY-ZR01 represents of a significant advancement of the investigation of additively manufactured BMGs for orthopedic applications, while the results of the ion release study highlights the effect that inflammatory conditions could have on the degradation of the alloy. copy; 2022 American Chemical Society. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Systematic measurements of charge transport in individual, highly-ordered epi-SL grains would facilitate the study of minibands in QD films. Here, we demonstrate the air-free fabrication of microscale field-effect transistors (μ-FETs) with channels consisting of single PbSe QD epi-SL grains (2-7 μm channel dimensions) and analyze charge transport in these single-grain devices. The eight devices studied show p-channel or ambipolar transport with a hole mobility as high as 3.5 cm2V-1s-1at 290 K and 6.5 cm2V-1s-1at 170-220 K, one order of magnitude larger than that of previous QD solids. The mobility peaks at 150-220 K, but device hysteresis at higher temperatures makes the true mobility-temperature curve uncertain and evidence for miniband transport inconclusive. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Herein, the sol-gel process for aerogels with digital light processing 3D printing to produce advanced functional materials possessing hierarchical pore structures and complex shapes is combined. It has revealed the temporal evolution of the photorheological behavior of acrylate-modified silica sols in an acid-base catalytic procedure, and confirmed that silica aerogels can be fabricated with very low acrylate content. The resulting aerogels are thermostable with intrinsic silica contents, skeletal densities, and physical characteristics similar to those of commercial silica aerogels yet distinct mechanical behaviors. More importantly, the printed silica aerogels can be used as a versatile nanoengineering platform to produce high-performance and multifunctional interpenetrating phase nanocomposites with complex shapes through programmable post-printing processes. Epoxy-based nanocomposites possessing excellent mechanical performance, ionogel-based conductive nanocomposites with decoupled electrical and mechanical properties, and anti-swelling hydrogel-based nanocomposites are demonstrated. The results of this study offer new guidelines for the design and fabrication of novel materials by additive manufacturing. © 2022 The Authors.

With the increase of the substrate preheating temperature, the risk of forming micro-cracks and keyholes is reduced, which is beneficial for high ductility, while the grain size is increased and the dislocation density is decreased, which is unconducive to obtaining high strength. The ultimate tensile strength and the ductility of the three samples reached 1134 ± 12 MPa, 8.36% ± 1.5% (room temperature), 854 ± 15 MPa, 25.75% ± 2% (100 ℃) and 841 ± 13 MPa, 30.39% ± 3% (200 ℃), respectively. The work-softening performance occurs in sample Ⅰ due to the generation of deformation twins being hindered by the ω phase. The appearance of lath-like {332}< 113 > deformation twins is responsible for the high work-hardening effect in samples Ⅱ and Ⅲ. The dislocation density is increased with the increase of strain and resultant enhanced dislocation strengthening, which is also one of the reasons for samples II and III showing an obvious work hardening. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Selective laser melting; Strengthening mechanisms; Substrate preheating treatment; Titanium alloy","Binary alloys; Deformation; Ductility; Melting; Microstructure; Molybdenum alloys; Preheating; Selective laser melting; Strain hardening; Tensile strength; Deformation twin; Dislocations densities; Mechanical performance; Microstructure performance; Preheating treatments; Selective laser melting; Strengthening mechanisms; Substrate preheating temperature; Substrate preheating treatment; Titanium (alloys); Titanium alloys","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51975061, 52171066, 52201104, 52205140); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2020JJ5599)","This work was supported by The National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant No. 52205140 , 51975061 , 52171066 , 52201104 ], Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [Grant No. 2020JJ5599 ].","Tian Y., Gora W.S., Cabo A.P., Parimi L.L., Hand D.P., Tammas-Williams S., Prangnell P.B., Material interactions in laser polishing powder bed additive manufactured Ti6Al4V components, Addit.

The peculiar chemical affinity of the ALD precursor to the substrate surface and the 2D nature of the Sb2Te3 enable the growth of an in situ crystallized SL film with a preferred orientation. The SL film shows a reduced reset current of ≈1/7 of the randomly oriented Ge2Sb2Te5 alloy. The reset switching is induced by the transition from the SL to the (111)-oriented face-centered-cubic (FCC) Ge2Sb2Te5 alloy and subsequent melt-quenching-free amorphization. The in-plane compressive stress, induced by the SL-to-FCC structural transition, enhances the electromigration of Ge along the [111] direction of FCC structure, which enables such a significant improvement. Set operation switches the amorphous to the (111)-oriented FCC structure. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","atomic layer deposition; oriented growth; phase-change memory; Sb <sub>2</sub>Te <sub>3</sub>/GeTe superlattice; switching current density; switching mechanisms; vertical devices","Atoms; Film growth; Phase change memory; Quenching; Silica; Titanium nitride; Atomic-layer deposition; Face-centred cubic; Melt-quenching; Oriented growth; Phase-change memory; Sb 2te 3/gete superlattice; Super-lattice films; Switching current density; Switching mechanism; Vertical devices; Atomic layer deposition","","","","","Semiconductor Research Corporation, SRC, (2827.001); Semiconductor Research Corporation, SRC; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (2020R1A3B2079882); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work was supported by the Logic and Memory Device Program of the Semiconductor Research Corporation (Grant No. 2827.001) and the National Research Foundation of Korea (Grant No. 2020R1A3B2079882).

However, wire-based AM of structurally sound and defect-free aluminum components is still challenging. In this work, an oscillating laser-arc hybrid additive manufacturing (O-LHAM) process was developed to fabricate thin-wall parts of Al-6Mg-0.3Sc alloy. To show the effect of oscillating laser beam on macro/micro-structure, porosity and mechanical properties, wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) of Al-6Mg-0.3Sc alloy part was also performed for comparison. The results showed that the surface roughness of O-LHAM samples was reduced by 34.7% and the effective wall width was increased by 20% when maximum width of the wall was same with WAAM. The porosity was significantly mitigated and the microstructures was refined and homogenized due to the string effect of beam oscillating in the molten pool. The as-deposited wall of Al-Sc alloy showed an ultimate tensile strength of more than 350 MPa, reaching an exceptional level among the as-deposited aluminum alloy. The O-LHAM samples showed a higher elongation and lower anisotropy, which are resulted from the mitigated porosity and homogenized microstructure. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Al-6Mg-0.3Sc alloy; Laser-arc hybrid additive manufacturing; Macro/micro-morphology; Mechanical properties; Oscillating laser beam; Porosity","Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Fabrication; Hybrid materials; Laser beams; Magnesium alloys; Microstructure; Porosity; Rare earths; Scandium alloys; Surface roughness; Tensile strength; Ternary alloys; Wire; Al-6mg-0.3sc alloy; Laser-arc; Laser-arc hybrid additive manufacturing; Macro micro; Macro/micro-morphology; Micro-mechanical; Micro-structures; Micromorphologies; Oscillating laser beam; Properties of Al; 3D printers","","","","","Heilongjiang Provincial Key Program of Engineering Science and Technology, (2020ZX03A01); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2021M700990); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Heilongjiang Provincial Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (LBH-Z20143); Heilongjiang Provincial Postdoctoral Science Foundation","We acknowledge the supports from the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2021M700990 ), the Heilongjiang Provincial Postdoctoral Science Foundation ( LBH-Z20143 ), and Heilongjiang Provincial Key Program of Engineering Science and Technology ( 2020ZX03A01 ).","Chuvil'deev V.N., Shadrina I.S., Nokhrin A.V., Kopylov V.I., Bobrov A.A., Gryaznov M.Y., Shotin S.V., Tabachkova N.Y., Chegurov M.K., Melekhin N.V., An investigation of thermal stability of structure and mechanical properties of Al-0.5Mg–Sc ultrafine-grained aluminum alloys, J.

The coupling design, simulation analysis, and characterization of the DCR-CC filter provide the foundation for the experiment. A nonlinear polarization rotation system was injected into the cavity to suppress gain competition and achieve a laser switchable among three wavelengths. The fluctuations of the wavelength and power of the output laser are less than 0.60 nm and 0.91 dBm, respectively. For demonstration, the laser maintained in SLM operation measured by the delayed self-heterodyne method has a linewidth of <3.7 kHz and relative intensity noise of < −114 dB/Hz. © 2022 Optica Publishing Group.","","Fiber Bragg gratings; Linewidth; Thulium; Cavity filters; Compound cavity; Coupling designs; Design simulations; Narrow-line width; Sampled fiber Bragg gratings; Single longitudinal mode; Switchable; Three-wavelengths; Thulium-doped fibers; Fiber lasers","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province for Outstanding Young Scholars, (F2020201001); Science and Technology Research Project of Higher Education in Hebei Province, (QN2021050); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61827818, 61975105, 62005013); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2022JBCG005); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","Funding.

In this work, different assemblies of magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) swarms were constructed. Temperature-sensitive hydrogels were used as carriers to fix the distribution and ensure the stability of the swarm structure and the biocompatibility of the microrobot. Under three different outfield assembly strategies (gravitational field, gradient magnetic field, and uniform magnetic field), six different assembly modes of MNP are encapsulated (three unilateral unfolding assemblies with different microsphere profiles, unilateral chain assembly, and two symmetric chain assemblies with different magnetic chain positions). Their differences in the execution of motion, magnetothermal effects, and release of loaded DOX drugs were explored. The results showed that the symmetrical chain assembly with the magnetic chain distributed on the outside showed the best performance due to the advantage of the magnetic moment. It has a speed of up to 600 μm/s and a temperature rise rate of up to 1.5 °C/min.

Decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) scaffolds placed into these wounds have shown the ability to modulate the immune response and drive constructive healing. This provides a potential solution for functional tissue regeneration, however, these acellular dECM scaffolds are challenging to fabricate into complex geometries. 3D bioprinting is uniquely positioned to address this, being able to create patient-specific scaffolds based on clinical 3D imaging data. Here, a process to use freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels (FRESH) 3D bioprinting and computed tomography (CT) imaging to build large volume, patient-specific dECM patches (≈12 × 8 × 2 cm) for implantation into canine VML wound models is developed. Quantitative analysis shows that these dECM patches are dimensionally accurate and conformally adapt to the surface of complex wounds. Finally, this approach is extended to a human VML injury to demonstrate the fabrication of clinically relevant dECM scaffolds with precise control over fiber alignment and micro-architecture. Together these advancements represent a step towards an improved, clinically translatable, patient-specific treatment for soft tissue defects from trauma, tumor resection, and other surgical procedures. © 2022 The Authors.

Earlier, we have established a synthetic lethal (SL) interaction between two genes that are CHK2 and PRDX2 in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. The SL interaction between CHK2 and PRDX2 resulted in selective targeting of CHK2-defective CRC cells. N-Carbamoyl alanine (NCA) is a PRDX2 inhibitor and is a peptide-like organic compound, which degrades after oral administration in harsh gastric pH. To overcome the limitations of NCA, a chitosan-based nanocarrier was developed for the entrapment of NCA. In this study, we targeted the SL interaction between PRDX2 and CHK2 using NCA-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (NCA-Chit NPs) to selectively inhibit the CHK2-null HCT116 cells. NCA-Chit NPs were assessed for various physicochemical characterizations such as the hydrodynamic diameter (size), zeta potential, and polydispersity index using a Zetasizer. Additionally, morphological studies for the shape and size of NPs were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Cellular uptake of NPs was confirmed using confocal microscopy, which exhibited that nanoparticles were able to internalize into the HCT116 cells. Blank Chit NPs were found to be cytocompatible as they did not exert any cytotoxic effects on hTERT, L929, and Caco-2 cells (intestinal epithelial cells). Importantly, NCA-Chit NPs were quite hemocompatible also. In the form of an NCA-chitosan nanoformulation, the efficacy was enhanced by about 8 times compared to free form of NCA towards selective killing of CHK2-null HCT116 cells as compared to HCT116 cells. The chitosan-based nanoformulation for NCA was developed to augment the efficacy of the NCA for enhanced cell death of colorectal cancer cells having CHK2 defects. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Recently, an optical realization of cylindrical holography using a planar SLM that converts planar holography into cylindrical holography through a conical mirror has been proposed. However, the magnification and quality improvement of the reconstruction have remained issues from the original method that still must be addressed. In this paper, a Fourier hologram optimization with stochastic gradient descent (FHO-SGD) is proposed for the magnification and quality improvement of an optical cylindrical holographic display. The reconstructed object is magnified 2.9 times by a lens with a focal length of 300 mm due to the optical properties of Fourier holograms. In addition, the quality of the reconstructed objects is significantly improved. Numerical simulation and optical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FHO-SGD method in the magnification and quality improvement of an optical cylindrical holographic display. © 2022 Optica Publishing Group.","","Gradient methods; Holographic displays; Lenses; Light modulators; Numerical methods; Optical properties; Stochastic systems; Conical mirror; Fourier holograms; Optical realization; Optical-; Optimisations; Property; Quality improvement; Reconstructed objects; Spatial light modulators; Stochastic gradient descent; article; computer simulation; stochastic model; total quality management; Holograms","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62275178, U1933132); Chengdu Science and Technology Program, (2022-GH02-00016-HZ)","Funding.

By adding TiB2 nanoparticles, FeCoNiCr high-entropy alloy composites produced via laser powder bed fusion was reinforced, it possessed the excellent structural stability of TiB2 and FeCoNiCr matrix, and its lattice was face center cubic without component segregation. The nanoparticles have positive influences on mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. The second-phase strengthening and the fine-grain strengthening sourcing generated by the nucleation effect of nanoparticles and the process characteristics of the laser powder bed fusion enhanced the strength. The nanoparticles induced grain refinement to reduce the electrochemical corrosion rate of the composite in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution, while the nanoparticles were easy to damage the passive film. The lower corrosion rate contributes greatly to the improvement of the corrosion resistance of the composite. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3-D Printing; Corrosion; Mechanical properties; Metal-matrix composites (MMCs)","","","","","","Aerospace Science and Technology Application Innovation Project; Young Top-notch Talent Cultivation Program of Hubei Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51605343, 52075393); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFB1103900); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2020A1515110790); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 52075393 and 51605343 ); the National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant no. 2017YFB1103900 ); Equipment pre-research - Aerospace Science and Technology Application Innovation Project; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (grant no. 2020A1515110790 ) and the Young Top-notch Talent Cultivation Program of Hubei Province .

Moving from the concept that rheology provides useful information to predict ink printability, this study improves and expands the potential of the previously published 3D-reactive printing approach by introducing pH as a key parameter to be controlled, together with printing time. Methods: The viscoelastic properties, printability, and microstructure of pectin gels crosslinked with CaCO3 were investigated and their composition was optimized (i.e., by including cell culture medium, HEPES buffer, and collagen). Different cell models representative of the major brain cell populations (i.e., neurons, astrocytes, microglial cells, and oligodendrocytes) were considered. Results and Discussion: The outcomes of this study propose a highly controllable method to optimize the printability of internally crosslinked polysaccharides, without the need for additives or post-printing treatments. By introducing pH as a further parameter to be controlled, it is possible to have multiple (pH-dependent) crosslinking kinetics, without varying hydrogel composition. In addition, the results indicate that not only cells survive and proliferate following 3D-bioprinting, but they can also interact and reorganize hydrogel microstructure. Taken together, the results suggest that pectin-based hydrogels could be successfully applied for neural cell culture.

In this work, austenitic 316L stainless steel was additively manufactured using selective laser melting (SLM), exhibiting typical heterogeneous microstructure with variation in grain structure, texture and metallurgical defects. Besides, the quasi-in-situ microstructural observation was conducted to reveal three competitive plastic deformation mechanisms to accommodate the deformation heterogeneities, i.e., lack-of-fusion pores, twinning and deformation bands. With presence of large lack-of-fusion pores (>1%), they accommodated the main strain and acted as preferential crack initiation sites, contributing to the pre-mature failure. In terms of near-full dense materials, microstructure and texture became significant with prevalent twinning and deformation bands. Twinning was activated in grains with <111> and <101> orientations parallel to the tensile direction, which promotes twin-dislocation and dislocation-cellular wall interactions and thus stabilizes the strain hardening. Deformation bands occurred along the columnar grain bands due to the deformation heterogeneities, which are likely to give rise to the initiation of micro-cracks with continuous strain. These findings offer insight into the microstructure modification and heterogeneous deformation behavior and provide key guidance for additively manufacturing stainless steels with high strength and ductility. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Defect; Deformation mechanism; Microstructure; Stainless steel","Additives; Austenitic stainless steel; Cracks; Selective laser melting; Textures; Twinning; 316 L stainless steel; Austenitic; Deformation band; Deformation heterogeneities; Deformation mechanism; Fusion pores; Heterogenous microstructure; Metallurgical defects; Microstructure evolutions; Microstructure modifications; Strain hardening","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51975384); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2019A1515110541)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51975384 ) and Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (No. 2019A1515110541 ).

LPBF-formed GH3230 nickel-based superalloy, however, suffers cracking and high residual stresses. This study systematically investigated the effects of different contents of submicron TiB2 particles on crack suppression and post-heat treatment for residual stress relief and improved microstructure anisotropy. The introduction of both 0.5 wt% and 1 wt% TiB2 achieved complete crack suppression in the LPBF-manufactured GH3230 specimens. As-built specimens with 0.5 wt% and 1 wt% TiB2 exhibited a supersaturated solid-solution microstructure, with the solid elements (Cr, Mo and W) almost fully dissolved in the matrix and only a limited number of Mo and Cr enriched carbides precipitated at the grain boundaries. Electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) characterization demonstrated that a large number of deformed grains remained in the as-built specimens. After heat treatment, the residual stresses were released and the number of deformed grains significantly reduced. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization demonstrated the disappearance of the dense dislocation network in the as-built specimens after heat treatment, accompanied by the precipitation of a large number of W-rich M6C carbides. This paper also discusses elevated-temperature (900 °C) mechanical properties. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) values of the as-built GH3230 with 0.5 wt% (GH-0.5) and 1 wt% TiB2 (GH-1) specimens were 255 and 290 MPa, respectively. Compared to the as-built materials, the UTS values decreased by 40 and 53.5 MPa, respectively, after heat treatment. The paper also discusses the effect weight of the second-phase, solid-solution and dislocation-strengthening mechanisms on the elevated-temperature mechanical properties. The findings indicate that the added 1 wt% TiB2 particles and the solid-solution elements contributed about 106.2 MPa and 111.5 MPa stress, respectively, in the heat-treated GH-1 specimen. The precipitated M6C carbides after heat treatment, however, were not found to significantly improve the high temperature strength. This work is expected to provide a reference for industrial applications to improve the LPBF formability of nickel-based superalloys and to acquire attractive microstructures. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; GH3230; Heat treatment; Laser powder bed fusion; Nickel-based superalloy","3D printers; Additives; Carbides; Chromium compounds; Cracks; Grain boundaries; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Mechanisms; Microstructure; Nickel alloys; Residual stresses; Scanning electron microscopy; Solid solutions; Stress relief; Superalloys; Tensile strength; After-heat treatment; Crack suppression; Deformed grains; Gh3230; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Nickel-based superalloys; Powder bed; Strength values; Ultimate tensile strength; Heat treatment","","","","","Shandong University Public Technology Platform, (ts20220112); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52005295); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, (ZR2020ZD05, ZR2022ZD08); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province","The authors appreciate the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52005295 ), the Shandong Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. ZR2022ZD08 , ZR2020ZD05 ) and the Instrument Improvement Funds of Shandong University Public Technology Platform (Grant No. ts20220112 ).","Haack M., Kuczyk M., Seidel A., Lopez E., Brueckner F., Leyens C., Comprehensive study on the formation of grain boundary serrations in additively manufactured Haynes 230 alloy, Mater.

The proposed autonomic manager supports SLAs by configuring the bandwidth ratios for each application scenario and uses an overlay network as an infrastructure. The most important aspect of the proposed autonomic manager is its scalability which allows us to deal with geographically distributed cloud-based applications and a large volume of computation. This can be useful in look ahead optimization and in adaptations using complex models, such as machine learning. We formally prove the safety and liveness properties of the implemented distributed algorithms. Through experiments on the Amazon AWS cloud, using two different use cases, we demonstrate the elasticity and flexibility of the autonomic manager as a measure of its applicability to different cloud applications with different types of workloads. Experiments also demonstrate that increasing the size of a look ahead window, up to a certain size, improves the accuracy of the adaptation decisions by up to 50%. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.","autonomic systems;

The current study investigates the screening potential of anti-inflammatory drugs using bioprinted inflamed human osteochondral units. The biomimetic hierarchical geometry is bioprinted using silk-based bioinks encapsulating pre-differentiated stem cells, creating an in vitro model. Inflammation is stimulated in the model, using tumor necrosis factor-alpha and Interleukin-1 beta pro-inflammatory cytokines. The resultant degeneration, akin to OA, is flagged by key markers like sulfated glycosaminoglycan, collagen, alkaline phosphatase, and downregulation of osteochondral transcript levels. In the next step, the screening of anti-inflammatory drugs is validated using celecoxib and rhein. Consequently, in the inflamed constructs, the initial upregulation of the key inflammatory mediators (nitric oxide, Prostaglandin E2), is subsequently downregulated, post-drug treatment. In addition, catabolic markers (matrix metalloproteinases and aggrecanase-1), indicative of hypertrophic and apoptosing chondrocytes, are significantly downregulated in the treatment groups; while the transcript and protein levels required for osteochondral health are attenuated. Therefore, the in vitro model mimicks the inflammation in the early stages of OA, and corroborates a potential high-throughput platform for screening novel anti-inflammatory drugs in OA therapeutics. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","3D bioprinting; drug screening platforms; in vitro disease models; osteoarthritis; osteochondral tissue engineering","Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Chondrocytes; Humans; Inflammation; Interleukin-1beta; Osteoarthritis; Silk; Biomimetics; Diagnosis; Drug delivery; Nitric oxide; Pathology; Phosphatases; Regenerative Medicine; Silk; Tissue; Tissue engineering; aggrecanase 1; alkaline phosphatase; bioink; celecoxib; collagen; collagenase 3; glycosaminoglycan; ink; interleukin 1; interstitial collagenase; matrix metalloproteinase; nitric oxide; prostaglandin E2; rhein; silk; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; antiinflammatory agent; interleukin 1beta; 3d bioprinting; Bioprinting; Disease models; Drug screening platform; Drug-screening; In vitro disease model; In-vitro; Osteoarthritis; Osteochondral; Osteochondral tissue engineering; adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell; antiinflammatory activity; apoptosis; Article; articular cartilage; biomimetics; cell differentiation; cell encapsulation; chondrocyte; controlled study; down regulation; geometry; human; human cell; in vitro study; inflammation; osteoarthritis; osteochondral unit; stimulation; three dimensional printing; upregulation; inflammation; metabolism; osteoarthritis; Stem cells","","aggrecanase 1, 147172-61-0; alkaline phosphatase, 9001-78-9; celecoxib, 169590-42-5; collagen, 9007-34-5; collagenase 3, 175449-82-8; interstitial collagenase, 9001-12-1; nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; prostaglandin E2, 363-24-6; rhein, 478-43-3; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, ; Interleukin-1beta, ; Silk, ","","","Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, DBT; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी; Ministry of Education, India, MoE","Y.P.S. and J.C.M. contributed equally to this work.

But the thermal properties of these structures remain unexplored. The main intend is experimentally investigation of the structure composed of alternating layers of 316 L stainless steel and Inconel 718 prepared by directed energy deposition. The effect of different laser powers during deposition on thermal properties, such as thermal expansion, specific heat, thermal diffusivity, and thermal conductivity for both materials structure and pure materials in the temperature range up to 700 °C, was studied. All these quantities were measured for both interfaces originated according to the sequence of built layers, and the influence of the interface on thermal properties was examined. Wider transition zone with more efficient composition mixing when 316 L is deposited on the Inco718 layer led to increased thermal diffusivity and conductivity values compared to the other interface. With increasing laser power, the decreases in thermal properties were observed. Cracks were observed at 316 L layers and at the interface when 316 L was deposited on Inconel 718 and are more pronounced with increasing laser power and resulting in negative effect on thermal properties. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","316L; Directed energy deposition; Inconel 718; Thermal conductivity","Austenitic stainless steel; Deposition; Specific heat; Structural properties; Thermal expansion; 316L; Alternating layers; Directed energy; Directed energy deposition; Energy depositions; Inconel-718; Laser power; Manufacturing process; Multi-material structure; Stainless steel (316L); Thermal conductivity","","","","","MSM/EF; Ministerstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy, MŠMT; Ministerstvo Průmyslu a Obchodu, MPO","The paper was supported by the project EF17_048/0007350 - Pre-Application Research of Functionally Graduated Materials by Additive Technologies ( 2018–2022 , MSM/EF), The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic and by the institutional funding of the research organization decision no. 3/2018 of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic .","Kieback B., Neubrand A., Riedel H.; Bandyopadhyay A., Heer B., Additive manufacturing of multi-material structures, Mater.

It describes their importance, mutual relationships and their influence on the quality of pieces manufactured using this technology. The ability to manage the speed of the additive manufacturing process allows us not only to effectively improve print quality but also, for example, to reduce the volume of necessary support structures. It thus speeds up the whole printing process, minimizes material waste, and reduces the need for any finishing operations which may be necessary for achieving the required final properties of the printed parts. In this context, the connection between the quality and the speed of additive manufacturing is demonstrated in a simple experiment using Powder Bed Fusion technology (PBF) in which the effect of the print speed on various low-angled flat surfaces is observed. © 2022, MM publishing Ltd..

In this study, the liquid phase ion exchange method is used to introduce atomic Ir into LaNiO3 perovskite oxide, which shows excellent catalytic performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The catalyst, LaNi0.96Ir0.04O3, with the optimal concentration of Ir, displays an overpotential of just 280 mV at 10 mA cm−2. The introduced Ir enriches the surface electron density significantly, which not only improves site-to-site electron transfer between O and Ni sites but also allows stable adsorption of the intermediates. The results of cyclic voltammetry tests reveal the superior overpotential and remarkable efficiency of the OER process because of the strong interactions in Ni–O–Ir. Moreover, the Ir atom inhibits the participation of a lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) in LaNiO3 that guarantees the stability of the catalyst in alkaline conditions. It is anticipated that this work will be instrumental for the preparation and study of a broad range of atomic metal-doped perovskite oxides for water splitting. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","atomic-level doping; Ni–O–Ir interaction; oxygen evolution reaction; perovskite oxides","Atoms; Cyclic voltammetry; Electron transitions; Ion exchange; Lanthanum compounds; Nickel compounds; Perovskite; Active center; Active components; Atomic levels; Atomic-level doping; Electron transfer; Ni–O–ir interaction; Overpotential; Perovskite oxides; Reaction activity; ]+ catalyst; Catalysts","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (21922105, 21931001); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局, (N_PolyU502/21); Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局; Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU, (1‐ZE2V); Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFA1501101); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (lzujbky‐2021‐37, lzujbky‐2021‐it12, lzujbky‐2021‐pd04); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project, (B20027); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project; Special Fund Project of Guiding Scientific and Technological Innovation Development of Gansu Province, (2019ZX‐04); Special Fund Project of Guiding Scientific and Technological Innovation Development of Gansu Province","The authors acknowledge support from the National Key R&D Program of China (2021YFA1501101), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21922105 and 21931001), the Special Fund Project of Guiding Scientific and Technological Innovation Development of Gansu Province (2019ZX‐04) and the 111 Project (B20027).

On the one hand, optimization of purity and defect density of printed metals is a prerequisite for their application in microfabrication. On the other hand, the additive approach to materials deposition with highest spatial resolution offers unique opportunities for the fabrication of materials with complex, 3D graded composition or microstructure. As a first step toward both—optimization of properties and site-specific tuning of microstructure—an overview of the wide range of microstructure accessed in pure copper (up to >99.9 at.%) by electrohydrodynamic redox 3D printing is presented, and on-the-fly modulation of grain size in copper with smallest segments ≈400 nm in length is shown. Control of microstructure and materials properties by in situ adjustment of the printing voltage is demonstrated by variation of grain size by one order of magnitude and corresponding compression strength by a factor of two. Based on transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography, it is suggested that the small grain size is a direct consequence of intermittent solvent drying at the growth interface at low printing voltages, while larger grains are enabled by the permanent presence of solvent at higher potentials. © 2022 The Authors.

The effects of TiC particles adding content on the microstructure, mechanical properties and corrosion resistance were investigated. After adding 1.0 wt% TiC particles, the average length of the γ grains decreased from 301 ± 61 µm to 114 ± 15 µm and the structure of grains changed from columnar dendrite into equiaxed dendritic at the top of each layer, which is results of the heterogeneous nucleation and increase of constitutional supercooling caused by TiC particles. The difference between horizontal and vertical mechanical properties of WAAM Ni690 component disappeared because the heterogeneous nucleation caused by TiC particles prevented the epitaxial growth. The ultimate tensile strength of the WAAM 1.0TiC-Ni690 component reached 590 MPa in both directions, which increased 10 % compared with no TiC addition. The improvement of mechanical properties was owing to the grain refinement and the formation of reinforcing TiC/(Ti, Nb)C second-phase particles. The potentiodynamic polarization tests showed that the improved corrosion resistance with the increased content of TiC particles. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests results showed that due to the refined γ columnar grains providing more nucleation sites, a denser and thicker passive film was formed, which improved the corrosion resistance. The composition of the passive film was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results reflected the more content of oxides and hydroxides of Cr in the passive film of WAAM 1.0TiC-Ni690 sample represented the denser passive film and better corrosion resistance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Corrosion resistance; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Nickel alloy 690; TiC particles; Wire arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Automotive industry; Corrosion resistance; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Grain refinement; Nucleation; Tensile strength; Textures; Titanium alloys; Titanium carbide; Wire; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Alloy 690; Cold metal transfers; Heterogeneous nucleation; Mechanical property and corrosion resistance; Nickel alloy 690; Passive films; TiC particles; Transfer technologies; Wire arc; Wire arc additive manufacturing; Nickel alloys","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52074191)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52074191 ).","Darolia R., Development of strong, oxidation and corrosion resistant nickel-based superalloys: critical review of challenges, progress and prospects, Int.

In a cylindrical tank, the mixing performances of a Rushton turbine (RT) and a pitched blade turbine (PBT) are investigated, using transient methods, i.e., the Unfrozen Flow Field (UFF) and the Frozen Flow Field (FFF) method, and the steady state Mean Age Theory (MAT) approach. The results are compared with experimental data, and the accuracy and numerical effort are judged. The results demonstrate that the MAT method can characterize the complete tracer distribution in the vessel and gives good agreement with experimentally obtained mixing times. Moreover, this method utilizes only a tiny fraction (8%) of the CPU time required by the UFF method. A multi-objective optimization study is performed utilizing the MAT method to find the best trade-off between mixing time and power consumption. The optimum impeller designs are obtained. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","CFD; Mean Age Theory; Mixing time; Optimization; Stirred tank","Computation theory; Economic and social effects; Flow fields; Mixing; Multiobjective optimization; Numerical methods; Tanks (containers); Cylindrical tanks; Field methods; Mean age theory; Mean ages; Mixing performance; Mixing time; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimisations; Rushton turbines; Stirred Tank; Computational fluid dynamics","","","","","China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201906060155); China Scholarship Council, CSC","This work was supported by China Scholarship Council (Grant No. 201906060155).","Bliatsiou C., Malik A., Bohm L., Kraume M., Influence of impeller geometry on hydromechanical stress in stirred liquid/liquid dispersions, Industr.

Here, a highly stable cathode ink using La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 was developed and characterized with particle size analysis, viscosity, surface tension, density, and thermal analysis. Both fresh and 6-months stored inks showed excellent jetability behavior with a Z number of 2.77 and 3.45, respectively. The ink was successfully inkjet-printed on a (LiNaK)2CO3-Gd:CeO2 porous electrolyte substrate to fabricate a symmetric cell. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements showed that at 550 °C the inkjet printing lowered the ohmic resistance to one-third (from 1.05 Ω cm2 to 0.37 Ω cm2) and the mass diffusion resistance by 4.25 times (from 6.09 Ω cm2 to 1.43 Ω cm2) as compared to drop-casted cell by creating a hierarchical porous structure and increasing reaction sites. Successful inkjet printing of the functional electrode material opens up a new avenue for the fabrication of the low-temperature ceramic fuel cells. © 2022 The Author(s)","Ceramics; Electrode; Inkjet printing; Solid oxide fuel cell; Stability","Cathodes; Cerium oxide; Cobalt compounds; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Ink; Ink jet printing; Iron compounds; Lanthanum compounds; Ohmic contacts; Particle size analysis; Screen printing; Solid electrolytes; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Strontium compounds; Temperature; Thermoanalysis; Ceramic; Ceramic fuel cells; Contact less; Highly stables; Ink jet; Ink-jet printing; Low temperature ceramics; Porous electrolytes; Solid-oxide fuel cell; Symmetrics; Particle size","","","","","Hubei Overseas Talent 100 program; Academy of Finland, AKA, (13322738, 13329016)","Funding text 1: The authors are thankful to Academy of Finland (Grant No. 13329016 , 13322738 ) for the financial support.

Recently, the integration of nonlinear χ(2) materials and metasurfaces has been recognized as a promising strategy for next-generation SLMs. However, their modulation efficiency still encounters challenges due to low quality factor and weak light-matter interaction. Here, we demonstrate an efficient SLM by manipulating the dual bound state in continuum (BIC) with the assistance of a binary-pore anodic alumina oxide template technique. The coexistence of symmetry-protected BIC and Fabry-Pérot BIC is obtained by a desirable sandwich configuration with a BIC metasurface and EO polymer, which efficiently restrain radiative loss and generate a strong quasi-BIC resonance. The assembled SLM with large absorption and Q-factor delivers a modulation depth of 77% and an f3 dB of nearly 100 MHz. This dual BIC metasurface provides potential for applications including switches, LIDAR, augmented and virtual reality, and so on.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.","binary plasmonic array; binary-pore anodic aluminum oxide template; bound states in the continuum; metasurface; spatial light modulator","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Anodic oxidation; Fabry-Perot interferometers; Light modulation; Light modulators; Optical radar; Optoelectronic devices; Q factor measurement; Anodic aluminum oxide template; Binary plasmonic array; Binary-pore anodic aluminum oxide template; Bound state in the continuum; Bound-states; Dual bound; Metasurface; Optoelectronic systems; Plasmonic arrays; Spatial light modulators; Optical properties","","","","","Special Support Plan for Photoelectric Chips Research at Westlake University, (10300000H062201); Westlake University, (WU2022C024); Westlake University; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52003225); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This project was supported by the Research Center for Industries of the Future (RCIF) at Westlake University (Grant No. WU2022C024), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52003225), and the Special Support Plan for Photoelectric Chips Research at Westlake University (Grant No. 10300000H062201).

The microstructure of SLM-processed specimens was mainly composed of columnar-grained BCC matrix (∼90 µm in width) and Cu-rich twinned FCC phase. The columnar grains grew epitaxially along the building direction and exhibited a strong {001} texture. In comparison, a coarse columnar-grained BCC matrix (∼150 µm in width) with a stronger 〈001〉 texture, rod-like B2 precipitates, and large core-shell structured FCC phases were formed in the LMD-processed specimens due to the higher heat accumulation effect. Consequently, the LMD-processed specimens showed a lower hardness, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance, but higher creep resistance and reduced Young's modulus than the SLM-processed specimens. Hot cracks occurred in both types of specimens, which could not be completely suppressed due to Cu segregation. © 2022","Corrosion; High entropy alloys; Laser metal deposition; Nanomechanics; Selective laser melting","Aluminum alloys; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Copper alloys; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant alloys; Corrosive effects; Deposition; Elastic moduli; Entropy; Fabrication; Iron alloys; Melting; Molecular dynamics; Selective laser melting; Textures; Wear resistance; Columnar grain; Comparatives studies; Corrosion behaviour; FCC phase; Grain grow; High entropy alloys; Laser metal deposition; matrix; Nano-mechanical behaviors; Selective laser melting; High-entropy alloys","","","","","HK Research Grants Council, (ECS 25202719, GRF 15227121); Sinoma Institute of Materials Research; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52020105013, 52111530193); Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities of the Central South University, (2021ZZTS0098); Guangxi Key Research and Development Program, (2022SK2006)","Funding text 1: This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 52111530193 and 52020105013 ), the Key Research and Development Program of Hunan Province (No. 2022SK2006), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central University of Central South University (No. 2021ZZTS0098 ), and the HK Research Grants Council (ECS 25202719 and GRF 15227121 ).

Along with several benefits the method proposes it is very important to keep a track on what how many properties are adversely affected or benefited which helps in optimized planning and projects a significant improvement when kept parallel to the cost efficiency of the product. In order to have such kind of observation it is necessary to map the granular trajectory of the material while going through the process. While additive manufacturing is largely implied upon polymers and metals to a certain extent, ceramics have also seen their part of technological advancement. Both metal and ceramics are equally important and opposite to one another. If somehow, we are able to exploit the benefits of both the materials while on additive manufacturing arena the compound would be highly cost efficient and customization friendly. This paper discusses the micro structural properties and evolution of both metals and ceramics and also on metal matrix composites which are highly in demand in recent times. © 2022.

For the first time, two suitable γ-TiAl alloys (TiAl48Cr2Nb2, TiAl45Nb4C) are combined in direct and gradual transitions to generate different microstructure morphologies and, consequently, different mechanical properties within a component after an identical heat treatment. The influence of alloy composition, microstructure type, and material transition on the tensile properties and fracture toughness is analyzed through miniature testing. Miniature tensile tests show no orientation dependency in regard to the build direction and the composition/microstructure transition is not found to be a preferred fracture site. The miniature fracture toughness tests reveal that already small composition changes—insufficient to alter the microstructure configuration—can have a significant effect on the cracking behavior.

CSAM is being considered for many applications. However, the environmental impact of CSAM of metal parts production are not well known. Therefore, the environmental impact of CSAM, in which energy consumption and CO2 emission are used as indicators in the life cycle assessment are considered in this study. We have calculated the specific energy consumption of CSAM at increasing process rate of 0.273 kg/h, 0.550 kg/h and 0.753 kg/h to be 373.0 MJ/kg, 225.1 MJ/kg, and 178.7 MJ/kg, respectively. The production of aluminium parts of different shapes was used for the cradle-to-grave life cycle analysis of machining and CSAM at different process rates. We have found that increasing process rates in CSAM of aluminium production as the route that allows less energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission compared to reducing the material used. This provides a route for optimising the layer thickness by increasing the process rate and lowering the environmental impact by reducing the number of layers required to build the parts in additive manufacturing. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","CO<sub>2</sub> emission; Cold spray additive manufacturing; Energy consumption; High process rate","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum; Carbon dioxide; Environmental impact; Global warming; Life cycle; Powder metals; Aluminum metal; CO 2 emission; Cold spray; Cold spray additive manufacturing; Cold-sprayed; Deposition process; Energy-consumption; High process rate; Manufacturing IS; Metal parts; Energy utilization","","","","","Cooperative Research Centres, Australian Government Department of Industry, CRC, (CRC-P57355); Cooperative Research Centres, Australian Government Department of Industry, CRC","This work was supported by the Cooperative Research Centres Projects (Grant Agreement CRC-P57355 ).

Four types of variable-thickness sheet lattices (VTSLs) are designed using the Schwarz-P type triply periodic minimal surface, taking into account the manufacturability of the laser powder bed fusion technique. Three-point bending tests are conducted to investigate the fracture performance of VTSLs. Using ductile damage simulations, the fracture evolution process is analyzed, and mechanisms of fracture initiation and crack interaction are described. Experimental and numerical studies have established that distributions of local materials have a significant impact on fracture patterns, including intracellular and intercellular fractures. Under the same condition, the flexural strength, energy absorption capability, and fracture force can be improved for VTSLs with smooth transitions of neighboring unit cells. Specifically, the strength of VTSLs can be further enhanced when the homogenized material model is used. This work establishes a link between the controllable fracture performance and the additive manufacturing design of VTSLs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Ductile damage simulation; Fracture patterns; Sheet lattices; Structural enhancement; Variable-thickness","Ductile fracture; Damage simulation; Ductile damage; Ductile damage simulation; Fracture pattern; Fracture performance; P-type; Sheet lattice; Structural enhancements; Triply periodic minimal surfaces; Variable thickness; Bending tests","","","","","Guangxi Young Teacher Education Project, (2020KY05020); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52165056, 62004050); Guilin University of Electronic Technology, GUET, (YCBZ2021073, YCBZ2022114, YCSW2022287); Guangxi Key Lab of Manufacturing System and Advanced Manufacturing Technology, MSAML, (17-259-05-018Z); innovation Project of Guangxi Graduate Education, (2020YCXS010, 2021YCXS001); key project of Guangxi Natural Science Foundation, (2019JJD160010)","This work was financially supported and funded by the Guangxi Young Teacher Education Project ( 2020KY05020 ), Guangxi Key Laboratory of Manufacturing Systems and Advanced Manufacturing Technology ( 17-259-05-018Z ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 62004050 , 52165056 ), the key project of Guangxi Natural Science Foundation ( 2019JJD160010 ), the innovation Project of Guangxi Graduate Education ( 2020YCXS010 , 2021YCXS001 ), the GUET Excellent Graduate Thesis Program ( YCBZ2021073 , YCBZ2022114 , YCSW2022287 ).

The present study examines a series of Ni–Co alloys that display different hardness and different tendencies for work hardening to better understand the role of work hardening in material removal during scratching. It is found that work hardening has a significant effect on the effective hardness – i.e. the resistance to penetration – during scratching. It is in this determination of the scratch hardness that work hardening plays its most important role in the present material. For a given value of static hardness, the scratch hardness – and hence resistance to scratching - is higher when the work hardening rate is higher. This has important implications for the prediction of scratch resistance using material properties. The work also shows the utility of the concept of scratch ductility in determining material removal during a scratch event and in the use of additive manufacturing techniques to facilitate rapid prototyping in the development of scratch resistant alloys. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","","Cobalt alloys; Hardness; Rapid prototyping; Wear resistance; Effective hardness; Manufacturing techniques; Material removal; Ni-Co alloy; Rapid-prototyping; Scratch hardness; Scratch resistance; Scratch-resistant; Static hardness; Work hardening rate; Strain hardening","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (AC74806, FL210100147, IC160100036); Deakin University","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the Australian Research Council centre for mine alloy research (IC160100036) and Acceleration commercialisation grants (AC74806).

These efforts pave an avenue toward the fabrication of synthetic scaffolds that can facilitate the study of cellular events for disease diagnosis and treatment. First, a series of boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) photocages with nitrogen-containing nucleophiles were examined to determine structure-reactivity relationships, which resulted in a >1,000× increase in uncaging yield. Subsequently, photoinduced hydrogel formation in 90 wt % water was accomplished via biorthogonal carbonyl condensation using hydrophilic polymer scaffolds separately containing BODIPY photocages and ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA) moieties. Spatiotemporal control is demonstrated with light on/off experiments to modulate gel stiffness and masking to provide <100 μm features. Biocompatability of the method was shown through pre-/post-crosslinking cell viability studies. Short term, these studies are anticipated to guide translation to emergent additive manufacturing technology, which, longer term, will enable the development of 3D cell cultures for tissue engineering applications. © 2022 The Author(s)","bioconjugation; bioorthogonal; BODIPY; cell encapsulation; hydrogel; photo-crosslinking; photobase; photocage; photoprotecting group; visible light","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (MSN-2107877, MSN-2107877); National Science Foundation, NSF; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R35GM138193); National Institutes of Health, NIH; Welch Foundation, (F-2007); Welch Foundation","The authors acknowledge primary support by the National Science Foundation under grant no.

Selective laser melting (SLM) recently has been used to fabricate TMCs, but their plasticity is generally poor as reported. Bimodal microstructures consisting of globular α are known to possess excellent comprehensive mechanical properties in Ti-based alloys. Heat treatment for the transformation of lamellar to globular microstructures is usually preceded by thermomechanical processing. This work reports a cyclic thermal treatment (CTT) for constructing a bimodal microstructure in SLM-processed Ti6Al4V-5vol%TiB composite without the need for predeformation. The CTT process involves repeated thermal cycling between 875 and 975 °C to induce notable changes in the fractions of α and β. Additionally, a β-region annealing process (1050 °C, 1 h) was designed and implemented before CTT to accelerate the globularization process. After a CTT of 10 cycles, a typical bimodal microstructure with highly spherical αp was successfully prepared. Meanwhile, the segregated TiB whisker clusters were significantly replaced by uniformly distributed individual TiB whiskers. Boundary splitting and termination migration are two competing mechanisms in the globularization process. TiB whiskers promote the globularization process through repeated heterogeneous nucleation in the cooling part. Compressive testing suggested that the sample with a bimodal microstructure (54.5% αp) exhibited improved plasticity (12.3%–27.3%) at the cost of acceptable yield strength reduction (1743 MPa–1392 MPa), which is desirable for structural applications. © 2022","Bimodal microstructure; Cyclic thermal treatment; Selective laser melting; Ti6Al4V–TiB composite","Aluminum compounds; Heat treatment; Melting; Microstructure; Nucleation; Plasticity; Selective laser melting; Bi-modal microstructures; Cyclic thermal treatment; Engineering fields; Globularization; High-strength; Selective laser melting; Ti6al4v–TiB composite; TiB whisker; Titanium matrix composites; Wear resistant materials; Titanium alloys","","","","","Major Special Project for Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province, (2014B010129002); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2019B090907001)","This work was supported by Research and Development Program Project in Key Areas of Guangdong Province ( 2019B090907001 ), Major Special Project for Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province ( 2014B010129002 ).

The cellular structures can widely be used in lightweight application as it provides a high strength-to-load ratio. Under the various testing condition, each topology shows different mechanical properties. This study investigates the structural response of various types of cellular structures in compression loading, both experimentally and numerically. For that purpose, honeycomb, modified honeycomb, and spiral-type topology were selected to investigate. Besides, structural properties change by changing the cell size for each topology is also investigated. The specimens were subjected to a compression test by a universal testing machine to determine the absorbed energy and other mechanical properties. An implicit numerical study was also conducted to determine cellular structure’s mechanical characteristics. The experimental and numerical results show that the honeycomb structure absorbs the maximum energy compared to the other structures. The experimentally and numerically calculated absorbed energy for the 4.8 mm honeycomb structure was 32.2J and 30.63J, respectively. The results also show that the increase of cell size for a particular cellular structure reduces the energy-absorbing ability of that structure.

Nevertheless, knowledge of membrane fouling mechanisms in FO process using SC as DS, especially the influence of SC on membrane fouling, is still inadequate, mostly due to the limited operation time in previous studies. Hence, present study focused on membrane fouling behaviors in FO with SC as DS, with particular focus on impact of SC in long-term operation. The results indicated that using SC as DS induced noticeable aggravation of membrane fouling on both active layer (AL) and support layer (SL) sides of FO membrane in long-term operation, which was not observed in short-term operation. On AL side, accumulation of Ca2+ and Mg2+ via back-diffusion from SC became significant during long-term operation, thereby substantially altered fouling behavior on AL side, resulting in more refractory membrane fouling. On SL side, calcium-based scaling was formed both in and within the porous matrix of SL during long-term operation. Accordingly, a combined membrane cleaning strategy (NaClO for AL + HCl and EDTA for SL) was developed. The results could facilitate the application of SC as an economical and feasible DS source. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Concentrate disposal; Forward osmosis; Membrane fouling; Seawater concentrate; Wastewater concentration","Aluminum; Desalination; Membrane fouling; Membranes; Seawater; Sodium compounds; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater reclamation; Active Layer; Concentrate disposal; Forward osmosis; Fouling behavior; Membrane fouling mechanisms; Pre-concentration; Seawater concentrate; Seawater desalination; Support layer; Wastewater concentration; concentration (composition); desalination; fouling; marine pollution; membrane; osmosis; waste disposal; wastewater treatment; Chlorine compounds","","","","","Six Major Talent Peaks of Jiangsu Province, (2018-JNHB-014); Young Science Leaders of Colleges and Universities of Jiangsu Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51978312); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (JUSRP122025); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 51978312 ]; the Six Major Talent Peaks of Jiangsu Province [grant number 2018-JNHB-014 ]; the Program to Cultivate Middle-aged and Young Science Leaders of Colleges and Universities of Jiangsu Province and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [ JUSRP122025 ].

To improve the bearing capacity of pressure hulls, in this work, variable-curvature shells were proposed. Based on the membrane theory and the non-momental theory, expressions for calculating the stress and buckling load of variable-curvature shells were derived. The generalized equal-strength shell theory was taken as an important index to evaluate the bearing capacity of pressure hulls. Pressure hulls with different geometric configurations were analyzed through numerical simulations. Finally, cylindrical and circular variable-curvature shells were fabricated via additive manufacturing. Furthermore, a comparative experiment was carried out on the two types of shells. The results reveal that variable-curvature shells have better mechanical properties than cylindrical shells, which results in a lower stress in the two main directions and a higher buckling load. Additionally, variable-curvature shells are in better agreement with the equal-strength shell theory and ensure a high material utilization. The expressions for calculating the stress and buckling load in this study are found to be highly accurate. © 2022","Additive manufacturing technology; Generalized equal-strength shell theory; Pressure hull; Variable curvature","Additives; Bearing capacity; Bearings (machine parts); Buckling; Offshore oil well production; Shells (structures); Additive manufacturing technology; Bearing capacity of pressures; Buckling loads; Deep-sea submersibles; Equal strengths; Generalized equal-strength shell theory; Pressure hull; Shell theory; Stress load; Variable curvature; bearing capacity; curvature; hull; innovation; manufacturing; mechanical property; ship design; technological development; 3D printers","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province, (2021CFB259)","The authors would like to thank the support of the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province ( 2021CFB259 ).","Babich D.V., Stability of shells of revolution with multifocal surfaces, Int.

However, the variability of mechanical properties may be higher than that of conventionally manufactured structures. Typically, the computational cost of the numerical modeling of such structures considerably increases when variability is considered. In deterministic analyses of periodic structures, the dispersion diagrams obtained for the first Brillouin zone (FBZ) can be used to predict attenuation bands for any direction of propagation. This can be further simplified considering only the contour of the irreducible Brillouin zone (IBZ) if the unit cell presents symmetries. The objective of the current investigation is to present evidence that, similarly to what occurs in deterministic cases, the stochastic results obtained by scanning only the IBZ contour of the proposed two-dimensional unit cell under 4-fold rotational symmetry of statistical variability coincides with statistical results obtained scanning the FBZ. This is not a direct result, because each individual unit cell sample is asymmetric. We show that, under symmetry of variability statistics, the stochastic results computed for supercells and for finite metastructures consisting of a finite number of cells also coincide with the results for the IBZ contour of the unit cell. This result is important, as it dramatically reduces the computation cost of the stochastic analysis of such structures. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Bayes’ factor; Mechanical variability; Periodic structure; Robust band gap","3D printers; Additives; Biomechanics; Cells; Cost benefit analysis; Cytology; Dispersion (waves); Periodic structures; Sensitivity analysis; Stochastic systems; Bayes factor; First Brillouin zone; Frame structure; Mechanical; Mechanical structures; Mechanical variability; Robust band gap; Stochastics; Unit cells; Energy gap","","","","","Brazilian National Council of Research CNPq, (305293/2021-4, 420304/2018-5); Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2018/15894-0, 2018/18774-6, 2019/00315-8); Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) through processes number 2019/00315-8 , 2018/18774-6 and 2018/15894-0 , and the Brazilian National Council of Research CNPq (Grant Agreement IDs: 420304/2018-5 and 305293/2021-4 ).

Static chemical etching (CE) as a pre-treatment for TO successfully removed the LPBF induced surface adhered powders. A mixture of rutile, Nb2O5, Ta2O5, and ZrO phases were formed as an oxide layer after TO. It can be found a better wear resistance was retained in this β-titanium alloy after TO, as demonstrated by the wear scar features with ploughing grooves changing into brittle peeling of oxides. Plain fatigue strength of CE treated alloy (150 MPa) was 1.5 times higher than the value of CE+TO treated alloy (60 MPa), as a result of multiple premature fatigue cracks possibly developing in the compounds region after TO. In vitro biocompatibility results showed no significant differences in metabolic activity of pre-osteoblasts seeded on the treated surfaces. In addition, early and late mineralisation assays revealed similar levels of 14-day ALP activity, and 28-day mineral deposits formed on the two biocompatible TNT5Zr-0.2O alloy surfaces. Overall, though the oxide layer is corrosion-resistant in the aggressive environment (3 M HCl solution), showing a potential application of TO in additively manufactured titanium medical devices. However, TO should be cautiously exploited due to the deterioration of mechanical properties. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Biocompatibility; Chemical-interfering fatigue properties; Laser powder bed fusion; Thermal oxidation; Wear properties; β-titanium alloy","Biocompatibility; Chlorine compounds; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant alloys; Deterioration; Etching; Niobium alloys; Niobium oxide; Oxide minerals; Tantalum oxides; Thermooxidation; Titanium dioxide; Wear of materials; Wear resistance; Zircaloy; Chemical etching; Chemical-interfering fatigue property; Fatigue properties; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; Thermal-oxidation; Titanium (alloys); Wear properties; Β-titania alloy; Titanium alloys","","","","","UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (MR/T017783/1); UK Research and Innovation, UKRI; Rolls-Royce; University of Birmingham","WK acknowledges the mechanical testing support from Rolls-Royce UTC laboratory at the University of Birmingham, and the wear testing support from Surface Engineering Research Group at the University of Birmingham.

However, the composite manufacturing process of these two technologies is rarely reported. WAAM-LMD hybrid additive manufacturing is a feasible method to satisfy the dual requirements of production efficiency and structural accuracy in today's aerospace field. In this study, a 10-mm-thick wall structure was manufactured by this process. The microstructure in different areas was characterized using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and electron backscattered diffraction to elucidate the formation mechanism of the interfacial microstructure. Meanwhile, the tensile properties were tested in different directions and regions of the component. The results indicate that the combined effect of WAAM and LMD areas lacks obvious defects. The average grain size of the bonding region is closer to the bottom of the LMD region and smaller than that of the WAAM region. Clear grain preference orientations and variant orientations were observed from the bottom to the top of the transition zone, which is affected by different thermal histories between the arc and the laser. In addition, equiaxed crystals and columnar crystals coexist in the remelting zone under the combined action of two factors: the epitaxial growth with columnar crystals and the high cooling rate of the molten pool. The properties of tensile specimens in different directions have few differences. However, the elongation obviously changes in the binding zone. Furthermore, the cleavage fracture gradually transforms into ductile fracture from the bottom to the top in the transition area. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Hybrid additive manufacturing; Interface microstructure; Laser melting deposition; Mechanical properties; Wire arc additive manufacturing","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Ductile fracture; Fabrication; Melting; Production efficiency; Scanning electron microscopy; Selective laser melting; Ternary alloys; Textures; Titanium alloys; Additive manufacturing technology; Columnar crystals; Hybrid additive manufacturing; Interface mi-crostructure; Interface microstructures; Laser melting deposition; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Regionalisation; Wire arc; Wire arc additive manufacturing; Deposition","","","","","Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2020A1515110293); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","This work was supported by Technology Advance Research Project ( D020304 ) and GuangDong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation ( 2020A1515110293 ).","Aufa A.N., Hassan M.Z., Ismail Z., Recent advances in Ti-6Al-4V additively manufactured by selective laser melting for biomedical implants: prospect development, J.

Due to poor polymerization, low curing energy resulted in a quasi-ductile behavior and low strain rate sensitivity. In contrast, high energy promotes the redistribution of the fracture energy from failure strain to failure stress, leading to increased sensitivity. Furthermore, poorly cured specimens show clean fracture surfaces, contrasting with their quasi-ductile behavior, whereas highly cured specimens present rough surfaces, generally associated with ductile fracture. Therefore, increasing curing energy promotes a transition from a quasi-ductile to an almost perfectly brittle behavior and influences the material's elastic, plastic, and fracture behaviors, which appear to be non-uniform throughout the thickness, especially for thicker structures. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Acrylate polymer; Additive manufacturing; Material properties gradient; SEM fractographic analysis; Strain rate dependency","3D printers; Additives; Curing; Fractography; Fracture mechanics; Strain rate; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Acrylate polymers; Curing condition; Ductile behavior; Energy; Fractographic analysis; Fracture behavior; Material property gradient; Post-curing; SEM fractographic analyse; Strain rate dependency; Ductile fracture","","","","","Ewha Womans University, Ewha; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (2019R1I1A1A01062323, 2021R1A2C2011854)","This project was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) of the Korea government (grant numbers: 2019R1I1A1A01062323, 2021R1A2C2011854).

However, their lack of vasculature limits the growth of volumetric tissue more than several millimeters thick which limits their success post-implantation. Perfused bioreactors enhance nutrient mass transport inside lab-grown tissue but remain poorly customizable to support the culture of personalized implants. Here, a multiscale framework of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), additive manufacturing, and a perfusion bioreactor system are presented to engineer personalized volumetric tissue in the laboratory. First, microscale 3D printed scaffold pore geometries are designed and 3D printed to characterize media perfusion through CFD and experimental fluid testing rigs. Then, perfusion bioreactors are custom-designed to combine 3D printed scaffolds with flow-focusing inserts in patient-specific shapes as simulated using macroscale CFD. Finally, these computationally optimized bioreactor-scaffold assemblies are additively manufactured and cultured with pre-osteoblast cells for 7, 20, and 24 days to achieve tissue growth in the shape of human calcaneus bones of 13 mL volume and 1 cm thickness. This framework enables an intelligent model-based design of 3D printed scaffolds and perfusion bioreactors which enhances nutrient transport for long-term volumetric tissue growth in personalized implant shapes. The novel methods described here are readily applicable for use with different cell types, biomaterials, and scaffold microstructures to research therapeutic solutions for a wide range of tissues. © 2022 The Authors.

Herein, a bioinspired hierarchical fast transport network (HFTN) in a 3D printed reduced graphene oxide/carbon nanotube (3DP GC) electrode demonstrating superior electrochemical performance is constructed. Theoretical calculations reveal that the HFTN of the 3DP GC electrode increases the ion transport rate by more than 50 times and 36 times compared with those of the bulk GC electrode and traditional 3DP GC (T-3DP GC) electrode, respectively. Compared with carbon paper, carbon cloth, bulk GC electrode, and T-3DP GC electrode, the HFTN in 3DP GC electrode endows obvious advantages: i) efficient utilization of surface area for uniform catalysts dispersion during electrochemical deposition; ii) efficient utilization of catalysts enables the high mass activity of catalysts and low overpotential of electrode in electrocatalytic reaction. The cell of 3DP GC/Ni-NiO||3DP GC/NiS2 demonstrates a low voltage of only 1.42 V to reach 10 mA cm−2 and good stability up to 20 h for water splitting in alkaline conditions, which is superior to commercialized Pt/C||RuO2. This work demonstrates great potential in developing high-performance 3D printed electrodes for electrochemical energy conversion and storage. © 2022 The Authors.

However, research on the effects of WAAM thermal cycles on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Al–Zn–Mg–Cu alloys is still lacking. In this study, quantitative thermal cycle data was obtained to investigate evolution of the microstructure, and then the mechanical behavior of the as-deposited part was investigated. Results indicated that the part mainly contained microcracks (predominantly liquation cracks), pores, and the interdendritic crystalline phase, which decreased the tensile properties. However, the grain morphology was dominated by orientations with direction of approximately 65° with respect to the deposition direction, which led to better tensile properties in the longitudinal direction than in the transverse direction. In addition, the microhardness reached the maximum (∼130 HV) after four to seven times thermal cycles, which was mainly attributed to the Guinier–Preston (GP) zone. The continuous high temperature resulted in the hardness minimum (∼104 HV), which was a significant factor in forming the η′ and coarse η phases in the part. Combined with the precipitation behavior, hardness of the whole part can be divided into two zone: unstable and stable zone. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Al–Zn–Mg–Cu alloy; Microstructure; Thermal cycle; Wire-arc additive manufacturing","Additives; Aerospace applications; Copper alloys; Hardness; Microstructure; Morphology; Thermal cycling; Wire; Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy; Large-scales; Metal structures; Microstructure and properties; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Properties of Al; Thermal; Thermal cycle; Wire arc; Wire-arc additive manufacturing; 3D printers","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52075009); Beijing Municipal Commission of Education, (KM201810005016)","This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52075009 ) and the Beijing Municipal Education Commission Fund (Grant No. KM201810005016 ).

So, it is important to have in-process transformation (CET: columnar to equiaxed transition) of the formed grains. This can be achieved by the proper control of the cooling rate during the solidification process. In this study, four vertical walls consisting of 10, 15, 20, and 25 layers of Inconel-82 alloy were produced using a GTAW-based AM process with varying input parameters. It has been observed that with the variation in travel speed and low frequency pulsed arc (3 Hz) the heat input varied from 705.1 J/mm (maximum) to 301.7 J/mm (minimum) which promoted the in-process grain refinement. The transformation of columnar grains into equiaxed grains having an average grain size of 19 µm was observed in the 15-layer wall. The average micro-hardness of the fabricated thin wall got enhanced from 228 HV in the 10-layer wall to 275 HV in the 15-layer wall owing to the grain refinement. Similarly, the maximum average ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and yield strength (YS) are observed in the transverse direction which is 650 MPa and 325 MPa respectively. The friction coefficient and wear rate are observed to be minimum in the 15-layer wall i.e., 0.42 and 4.7 × 10−4 mm3/Nm respectively. Furthermore, the anisotropy in the tensile properties is observed to be minimum in 15 layer wall (average UTS: 1.9 %; average YS:3.8 %). © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Anisotropy; Cooling rate; Grain refinement; Inconel alloys; Wire-Arc Additive Manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Anisotropy; Cooling; Friction; Friction stir welding; Grain size and shape; Liquid metals; Microhardness; Tensile strength; Textures; Wire; Additive manufacturing process; Cooling rates; Grains refinement; Heat input; In-process; Inconel; Inconel alloys; Ultimate tensile strength; Wire arc; Wire-arc additive manufacturing; Grain refinement","","","","","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी, (SR/FST/ET-II/2018/222); Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी","The authors are thankful to the Department of Science and Technology , Government of India, for providing a 3D Profilometer characterization facility under the FIST project grant SR/FST/ET-II/2018/222 (C).","Marinelli G., Martina F., Ganguly S., Williams S., Grain refinement in an unalloyed tantalum structure by combining Wire+ Arc additive manufacturing and vertical cold rolling, Addit.

In this study, electrochemical performance of EDLC supercapacitor assembled with 3D printed electrodes and two different electrolyte salts (KCl and (NH4)2SO4) in a PVA gel has been analysed. The electrodes are printed using graphene/carbon nanofiber incorporated PLA composite filaments. It is found that post-processing of printed electrodes is necessary to improve the electrochemical performance. Therefore, printed electrodes are sonicated in Dimethylformamide (DMF) solution, which modifies the electrode surface and increases the exposure of conducting materials with electrolyte. Effect of sonication time has been studied by exposing electrodes for 2 min and 10 min. The specific capacitance increases by two orders with 2 min sonication in both KCl and (NH4)2SO4. Also, increasing the sonication time to 10 min decreases the specific capacitance by 43 % for KCl and 23 % for (NH4)2SO4, respectively. This is due to loss of structural integrity of the printed electrode with prolonged sonication time. This study provides a foundation to design more efficient electrodes for EDLC supercapacitors. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Energy storage; Fused Deposition Modelling; Solvent-activation; Supercapacitor","3D printers; Capacitance; Chlorine compounds; Deposition; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolytes; Nitrogen compounds; Organic solvents; Potassium compounds; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Electrochemical performance; Performance; Printed electrodes; Printing techniques; Solvent-activation; Sonication time; Specific capacitance; Surface-modification; Supercapacitor","","","","","Central Analytical Lab; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी, (ECR/2018/002281); Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी; Science and Engineering Research Board, SERB","Funding text 1: We would like to acknowledge the funding received from the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Department of Science and Technology (DST), India, through the project: ECR/2018/002281.

In this regard, the additive manufacturing technique, i.e., three-dimensional printing (3-D printing), has gained tremendous attention because of its ability to fabricate tunable functional ceramic layers with cost-effectiveness and mass customization. Therefore, in this work, the anode (NiO-ScSZ) and cathode (LSM) of the large-area SOFC (5 × 5 cm2) are printed using a direct-ink-writing (DIW) printer. The anode-functional and electrolyte layers are coated by spray and spin coating. The viscosity of the optimized anode and cathode inks are 5.85 Pa s and 0.97 Pa s, respectively. The electrochemical impedance and the performance of 3D-SOFC are investigated by supplying hydrogen and air. The maximum power density of the cell is 368 mW cm−2 at 800 °C. However, by inserting a hybrid scandia stabilized zirconia layer by spraying followed by magnetron sputtering onto the AFL, the electrochemical performance of the cell is significantly (21%) enhanced; the peak power density is 442 mW cm−2, and the corresponding polarization resistance is 0.267 Ω cm2 at 800 °C. Furthermore, the long-term cell test under galvanostatic mode (j = 0.5 A cm−2) at 700 °C for 100 h and thermal cycling between 400 and 700 °C concludes that the 3D-SOFC exhibits exceptional stability with a voltage loss of 0.845% h−1 and thermomechanical durability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; AC-EIS; And Thermomechanical stability; DIW printer; Magnetron sputtering; Solid oxide fuel cell","Anodes; Cathodes; Cost effectiveness; Magnetron sputtering; Nickel oxide; Printing presses; Screen printing; Solid electrolytes; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Zirconia; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; AC-EIS; And thermomechanical stability; Cell-be; Cell/B.E; Direct-ink-writing printer; Magnetron-sputtering; Solid-oxide fuel cell; Thermomechanical stability; 3D printers","","","","","","","Minh N.Q., Solid State Ionics, 174, pp. 271-277, (2004); Singhal S.C., Solid State Ionics, 135, pp. 305-313, (2000); Choudhury A., Chandra H., Arora A., Renew.

The shape and functionality of the printed static structures can be modified because of their unique property of response to external stimuli. In this work, different compositions of biodegradable polymers, polylactic acid (PLA), and polycaprolactone (PCL) were 4D printed using direct ink writing (DIW). The shape-memory effect of various compositions of PLA/PCL blends was investigated. PLA served as a fixed phase in order to memorize the original shape of the sample, and PCL served as a reversible phase to facilitate the transition and fixation to a temporary shape. The response temperatures were found to depend on the glass transition temperature of samples obtained from differential scanning calorimetry. Finally, a biomedical application of the blend was explored by characterizing the shape-memory behavior of printed tracheal scaffolds. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","4D printing; Additive manufacturing; Polymers; Shape memory materials; Tracheal scaffold","Additives; Biodegradable polymers; Differential scanning calorimetry; Glass transition; Medical applications; Scaffolds; Shape-memory polymer; 4d printing; External stimulus; Medical Devices; Polymer composite; Polymer polylactic acids; Property; Shape memory polymers; Shape-memory materials; Static structures; Tracheal scaffold; 3D printers","","","","","","","Mohol S.S., Sharma V., Rapid Prototyp.

The pore structure of both the 3DP and original sample are analyzed comparatively, as well as the pore size distribution (PSD), porosity, and absolute permeability by DRP simulation. The visualized CO2 displacing oil experiment on the 3DP sample are conducted, and compared with the experimental benchmark data. The results indicate that: 1) The PSNR of the 3DP S1 is in [9.010, 14.983], and its SSIM is in [0.870, 0.925]. Most pore features are printed but some are not in its original size or position. 2) The porosity and permeability of the 3DP sample are 10.01% and 27.81mD, showing a decline of 2.91% and 32.49mD compared to the original sample. 3) Two primary causes for the mismatching of the pore structure are confirmed, including insufficient removal of uncured resin, and shrinkage effect in light curing process. 4) Most contact angles of oil in 3DP sample lie in [0°, 90°], indicating it is oil-wetted.

This problem is not straightforward since the equations of motion of radially periodic systems do not have periodic coefficients and thus Bloch solutions in these radially periodic systems are not valid. To overcome this, EPCs and LREPCs use radially dependent properties to force periodic coefficients in the equations of motion of radial elastic waves, enabling the application of the Bloch theorem and thus allowing for properties of PCs and AMs. However, the required radially dependent properties severely complicate their physical realization, since modulus and density must be tailored such that they follow a specific radial variation. In this paper, we propose a method to physically realize an LREPC by radially varying its impedance through spatial changes to its out-of-plane thickness. Physical realization of the LREPC also involves local torsional resonances. In contrast to typical AMs, the resonators in the LREPC must be geometrically different to retain the same torsional stiffness and moment of inertia at different radii. We use additive manufacturing plus traditional machining to fabricate the LREPC. We introduce an experimental setup to measure radially propagating torsional waves in the LRPEC and show how to decouple torsional vibrations from bending vibrations to accurately measure transmission. To show the importance of using an LREPC, we compare its dynamic response to a locally resonant homogenous system (LRHS), a system that is radially periodic but has non-periodic equations of motion. Measured transmission shows that only the LREPC attenuates waves inside the band gap frequencies predicted by Bloch analysis. This work experimentally shows that LREPCs allow for the application of well-known concepts of AMs to control radially propagating torsional waves. © 2022","band gaps; experimental validation; metamaterials; phononic crystals; radial waves; torsional vibrations","Acoustic impedance; Energy gap; Equations of motion; Metamaterials; Phonons; Resonance; Acoustic metamaterial; Equation of motion; Experimental validations; Periodic coefficients; Phononic Crystal; Physical realization; Propagating waves; Property; Radial waves; Torsional vibration; Elastic waves","","","","","Lee Alcoque and Anurag Bhattacharyya; National Science Foundation, NSF, (CMMI-2031110); National Science Foundation, NSF","Funding text 1: This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. CMMI-2031110.

However, despite the great advantage of a decoupled price to part complexity of an AM fabricated structure, the material properties (largely governed by filament material and printing parameters) still present a significant limiting factor. In this context, the development of new filament materials for a wider range of applications has great potential. In this study, the influence of micro-scale filler reinforcement (powders), both natural (curauá) and synthetic (glass fibre), in the fabrication of an Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) filament was evaluated. The filler was controlled by weight fraction (~1%) and the filament was fabricated via extrusion. A commercially available 3D printer was used to print tensile and flexural specimens for mechanical characterization as per ASTM standards. The fracture morphology was analysed after tensile testing via optical microscopy in order to evaluate the effect of the fillers on the material deposition and void formation. No significant variation in the tensile properties was reported, except for the strain at failure, while more significant flexural strength variation was observed as a function of filler material. The fillers presented a significant effect on the void density of the fractured surface. It was demonstrated that this simple fabrication technique can generate novel filament materials that may enhance the mechanical properties or widen the range of application (e.g., faster decomposition times in nature for single-use plastics due to the hydrophilic nature of the natural filler and lower water absorption of the hydrophobic synthetic filler for marine environment applications). © Galati University Press, 2022.","additive manufactured parts; ABS; fillers; mechanical properties","","","","","","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, FAPERJ","Authors would like to acknowledge the support of the Brazilian Research Agencies CNPq and FAPERJ.","Standard terminology for additive manufacturing technologies, (2012); Le Duigou A., Correa D., Ueda M., Matsuzaki R., Castro M., A review of 3D and 4D printing of natural fibre biocomposites, Materials & Design, 194, (2020); Ngo T.D., Kashani A., Imbalzano G., Nguyen K.T.Q., Hui D., Additive manufacturing (3D printing): A review of materials, methods, applications and challenges, Composites Part B: Engineering, 143, pp. 172-196, (2018); Popescu D., Zapciu A., Amza C., Baciu F., Marinescu R., FDM process parameters influence over the mechanical properties of polymer specimens: A review, Polymer Testing, 69, pp. 157-166, (2018); Zhuo P., Li S., Ashcroft I.A., Jones A.I., Material extrusion additive manufacturing of continuous fibre reinforced polymer matrix composites: A review and outlook, Composites Part B: Engineering, 224, (2021); Solomon A., Rosenthal Y., Ashkenazi D., Stern A., Structure and mechanical behavior of additive manufactured fused deposition modeling ABS, Annals of “Dunarea de Jos” University of Galati.

A unique ASALD process was developed to selectively deposit pseudocapacitive titanium oxide and nitride layers on one or both interdigitated vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) electrodes to form asymmetric or symmetric 3D MSC devices. This work compliments and expands on our previously published article exploring ALD of thin conformal coatings of TiO2 and TiN on VACNTs for 3D MSCs. Further, we demonstrate the first use of Aerosol Jet Printing, a recently developed additive manufacturing technique, to enable ASALD patterning of 3D MSC devices by direct writing of PMMA inhibitors on and adjacent to relatively thick nanostructured electrodes. The synthesis, characterization, and performance evaluation of ASALD TiN-TiO2-VACNT 3D MSCs described herein provides a novel approach for manufacturing of new nanocomposite based electrochemical energy storage microdevices that could be integrated as an on-chip power source for portable electronics. Results indicated the symmetric ASALD TiN(100)-TiO2(100)-VACNT MSC (6.55 mF cm−2) exhibited nearly two orders of magnitude (94×) improvement in specific capacitance compared to the uncoated VACNT MSC (0.07 mF cm−2), significantly improving energy density (3.28 mWhr cm−2) while maintaining high power density (2.34 mW cm−2). © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","","Aerosols; Carbon nanotubes; Electrodes; Flowcharting; Titanium dioxide; Titanium nitride; Aerosol jet printings; Area selective; Atomic-layer deposition; Deposition process; Interdigital; Microsupercapacitors; Pseudocapacitive; Symmetrics; Titanium oxide layer; Vertically aligned carbon nanotube; Atomic layer deposition","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (ECCS-2025462); National Science Foundation, NSF","This work was performed in part at the Georgia Tech Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnology, a member of the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI), which is supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant ECCS-2025462 ).","Kyeremateng N.A., Brousse T., Pech D., Microsupercapacitors as miniaturized energy-storage components for on-chip electronics, Nat.

Design/methodology/approach: This work investigates experimental prototyping of a reversibly self-shaping façade, by integrating the parametric design approach, smart material and 4D-printing techniques. Thermo-responsive building skin modules of two-way shape memory composite (TWSMC) was designed and fabricated, combining the shape memory alloy fibers (SMFs) and 3D-printed shape memory polymer matrices (SMPMs). For geometry design, deformation of the TWSMC was simulated with a dimension-reduced mathematical model, and an optimal arrangement of three different types of TWSMC modules were designed and fabricated into a physical scale model. Findings: Model-based experiments show robust workability and formal reversibility of the developed façade. Potential utility of this module for adaptive building design and construction is discussed based on the results. Findings help better understand the shape memory phenomena and presented design-inclusive technology will benefit architectural communities of smart climate-adaptive building. Originality/value: Two-way reversibility of 4D-printed composites is a topic of active research in material science but has not been clearly addressed in the practical context of architectural design, due to technical barriers. This research is the first architectural presentation of the whole design procedure, simulation and fabrication of the 4D-printed and parametrically movable façade. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","4D printing; Kinetic architecture; Material programming; Parametric architecture; Shape memory composite; SMA; SMP","3D printers; Fabrication; Facades; Shape-memory alloy; Shape-memory polymer; 4d printing; Design/methodology/approach; Facade design; Kinetic architectures; Material programming; Parametric architecture; Shape memory composites; SMA; SMP; Two ways; Architectural design","","","","","Ajou University, (S-2021-G-0001-00016); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (NRF-2021R1C1C1003403)","The author would like to give special thanks to all the contributors, especially Ms. Yuri Kim and the Makerspace consulting and support team in Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea.

Therefore, this work aims to assess the tribological behaviour of A357 alloy (AlSi7Mg0.6) produced by LPBF as a function of both printing parameters and heat treatment conditions, applying a novel T6 based on rapid solution followed by artificial aging, which improves the strength-ductility balance. Dry sliding tests (block-on-ring) were performed using A357 samples as stationary blocks against rotating quenched and tempered AISI 52100 (100Cr6) steel. LPBF samples were compared with A357 obtained by sand casting, subjected to Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) and conventional T6 heat treatment. Microstructural refinement induced by LPBF carried out in optimised conditions, even without post-processing treatments, reduced the wear rate in comparison to conventional sand-cast, HIP-ed and T6 heat-treated A357, while maintaining comparable coefficient of friction. The rapid solution T6 did not worsen the tribological behaviour of as-built LPBF A357 components, even though it induced a slight hardness decrease. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Electron microscopy; Non-ferrous metals; Other manufacturing process; Sliding wear; Surface topography; Wear testing","Aluminum alloys; Heat treatment; Hot isostatic pressing; Topography; Tribology; Wear of materials; Dry sliding; Hot-isostatic pressings; Laser powders; Manufacturing process; Non-ferrous metals; Other manufacturing process; Powder bed; Sliding wear; Tribological behaviour; Wear-testing; Friction","","","","","Italian Ministry for the Economic Development; Università di Bologna, UNIBO; Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico, MiSE, (I34I19005780001)","Funding text 1: The Authors would like to acknowledge Dr. Iuri Boromei at the University of Bologna, Italy, for his invaluable contribution to the FEG-SEM, EDS and surface topography analysis.

However, there is limited research on the load-rate effects affecting in-plane compression. For the first time, this study investigates the in-plane compressive performance of Steel 316L honeycomb structures produced via material extrusion (ME) and laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). ME honeycombs of three cell sizes and single-cell size LPBF honeycombs were tested under uniaxial compression at varying quasi-static loading rates. Digital image correlation (DIC) was also employed to capture the deformation modes of the honeycombs and to map the local strain fields during compression. Empirical models were used to predict the in-plane compressive performance of the honeycomb structures. Particularly for the plastic collapse stress, an empirical formula incorporating viscoplastic dependency on the cell wall material within the quasi-static loading regime has been derived, producing accurate predictions. Both types of honeycomb structures are load-rate sensitive, as their compressive mechanical properties improved with the load rate increase. Moreover, the variation of the cell size was found to optimise the in-plane compressive performance. The deformation mode for both honeycomb structures was confirmed to be cell wall bending, plastic buckling, cell wall collapse, and folding. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Compressive strength; Honeycomb structures; Laser powder bed fusion; Material extrusion; Steel; Strain rate","3D printers; Additives; Austenitic stainless steel; Biomechanics; Cells; Compressive strength; Cytology; Deformation; Extrusion; Image correlation; Sandwich structures; Strain rate; Stress analysis; Cell walls; Cell-size; Compressive performance; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Load rate; Material extrusion; Powder bed; Rate effects; Strain-rates; compression; compressive strength; digital image; extrusion; loading; manufacturing; steel structure; strain rate; Honeycomb structures","","","","","School of Engineering of the University of Limerick; Science and Engineering Faculty, Queensland University of Technology","This work has been supported by the Faculty of Science and Engineering and the School of Engineering of the University of Limerick.

We present a novel floating flux-controlled MC that is designed using only three current feedback amplifiers, one analog multiplier, one capacitor and one resistor. Compared with existing floating MC emulators, our proposed design has a simpler structure without the need for DC biasing voltage sources, and can operate at higher working frequencies, and therefore enabling rapid prototyping of applied MC circuits for experimental verification of large-scale MC arrays. The consistency of the theoretical analysis, simulation and experimental results confirms the correctness and practicability of this new memcapacitor emulator. To further demonstrate a potential use of our MC, in this work, we apply the MC as the first parameterizable leaky integrator for spiking neuron through simulation and experiments. The intrinsic tunable capacitance of the MC can bring about novel short-term memory dynamics to neuronal circuits by dynamically modifying the membrane time constant on-the-fly, which ultimately resembles long-term potentiation, and can thus offer longer term memory. Our results highlight the potential for integrating heterogeneous spiking neural networks with richer temporal dynamics that rely on MC-based circuits to further the capability of neuromorphic computing.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.","emulator; leaky integrate-and-fire neuron; Memcapacitor; neuromorphic computing; spiking neural network","Capacitance; Feedback amplifiers; Neurons; Computing system; Emulator; Future designs; Leaky integrate and fire neuron; Low Power; Memcapacitor; Neural-networks; Neuromorphic computing; Spiking neural network; Spiking Neurones; Neural networks","","","","","","","Adhikari S.

Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a green tea compound, has gained attention as a safer alternative treatment for bone disorders. The 3DP TCP scaffold is designed for localized EGCG delivery, which can enhance in vitro osteogenic ability, anti-osteoclastogenic activity, vascularization formation, and chemoprevention. In the cocultures of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and monocytes (THP-1), EGCG release enhances osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs at day 16 compared to the control; this is indicated by a 2.8- and 4.0-fold upregulation of Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein (BGLAP), the early and late osteoblast differentiation marker expressions. However, EGCG significantly downregulates the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) expression by 7.0-fold, indicating that EGCG suppresses RANKL-induced osteoclast maturation. EGCG also stimulates endothelial tube formation at as early as 3 hours when human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) grow on Matrigel. It reduces human osteosarcoma MG-63 cell viability by 66% compared to the control at day 11. An in vitro release kinetics study demonstrates that EGCG shows a ∼64% release within a day followed by a sustained release in the physiological environment (pH 7.4) because its phenolic hydroxyl groups are easily deprotonated at physiological pH. These findings contribute to developing a multifunctional scaffold for the treatment of low load-bearing patient-specific bone defects after trauma and tumor excision. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Bone and Bones; Calcium Phosphates; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Osteogenesis; 3D printers; Bone; Cell culture; Defects; Endothelial cells; Patient treatment; pH; Scaffolds (biology); Stem cells; Transcription; Transmission control protocol; calcium phosphate; epigallocatechin gallate; Biological evaluation; Bone regeneration; Bone scaffolds; Epigallocatechin gallate; Human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells; In-vitro; Load-bearing; Low load; Patient specific; Tri-calcium phosphates; bone; bone development; human; umbilical vein endothelial cell; Calcium phosphate","","calcium phosphate, 10103-46-5, 13767-12-9, 14358-97-5, 7758-87-4; epigallocatechin gallate, 989-51-5; calcium phosphate, ; Calcium Phosphates, ; epigallocatechin gallate, ; tricalcium phosphate, ","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01 DE029204-01, R56 AR066361-06); National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS; National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIDCR; Washington State University, WSU","The authors would like to acknowledge financial support from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) of the NIH grant number R01 DE029204-01 (PI: Bose) and the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) of the National Institutes of Health, USA under Award Number R56 AR066361-06 (PI: Bose).

However, the effectiveness of the scaffolds has been hampered by the limited cell behavior and functions. Herein, a therapeutic cell-laden hydrogel for bone regeneration is therefore developed through the design of a void-forming hydrogel. This hydrogel is prepared by digital light processing (DLP)-based bioprinting of the bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) mixed with gelatin methacrylate (GelMA)/dextran emulsion. The 3D-bioprinted hydrogel can not only promote the proliferation, migration, and spreading of the encapsulated BMSCs, but also stimulate the YAP signal pathway, thus leading to the enhanced osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. In addition, the in vivo therapeutic assessments reveal that the void-forming hydrogel shows great potential for BMSCs delivery and can significantly promote bone regeneration. These findings suggest that the unique 3D-bioprinted void-forming hydrogels are promising candidates for applications in bone regeneration. © 2022 The Authors","3D bioprinting; Bone marrow stem cells; Bone regeneration; Macroporous hydrogel; Void-forming","Bone; Cytology; Emulsification; Hydrogels; Scaffolds (biology); 3d bioprinting; Bioprinting; Bone marrow stem cells; Bone regeneration; Cell-be; Cell/B.E; Digital light processing; Macroporous hydrogels; Stem-cell; Void-forming; Stem cells","","","","","Chongqing Graduate Tutor Team Project, (dstd201903); Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program, (2022YFQ0004); Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program; Chongqing Science and Technology Foundation, (cstc2021jcyj-msxmX0466, cstc2021jcyj-msxmX0475); Chongqing Science and Technology Foundation; Army Medical University, (2019XLC2014); Army Medical University","This study was supported by grants from the Clinical Innovation Project of Army Medical University ( 2019XLC2014 ), Science and Technology Foundation of Chongqing ( cstc2021jcyj-msxmX0475 and cstc2021jcyj-msxmX0466 ), Chongqing Graduate Tutor Team Project ( dstd201903 ), and Sichuan Science and Technology Program ( 2022YFQ0004 ).

In this work, the uniform thin Y2O3 coating was successfully introduced on the surface of the Cu-Cr-Zr powders by an in-situ chemical method. This Y2O3 coating can reduce the laser reflectivity of Cu-Cr-Zr powders without destroying their sphericity. The effect mechanism of Y2O3 on the microstructure, mechanical properties and electrical conductivity of Cu-Cr-Zr specimens was further clarified. The grain size of the LPBF manufactured specimens is much smaller in case of Y2O3 doped Cu-Cr-Zr powder than that of the Cu-Cr-Zr powder. The Cu2CrZr(Y, O) nanoparticles with the size of ∼50 nm form in the Cu matrix of Y2O3 doped Cu-Cr-Zr specimens, in addition to the Cr and Cu2CrZr precipitated particles. These Cu2CrZr and Cu2CrZr(Y, O) precipitated particles both exhibit a coherent interface with Cu matrix. Due to the refined grains and coherent second phase nanoparticles within grains mentioned above, the yield strength and ductility of Y2O3 doped Cu-Cr-Zr specimens are both improved significantly compared with the yield strength and ductility of undoped Cu-Cr-Zr specimens. Furthermore, the correlation between microstructure and properties of the Y2O3 doped Cu-Cr-Zr alloys manufactured by LPBF was also clarified. Our work provides a new strategy and in-depth view for the laser additive manufacturing of high-performance copper alloys and other alloys with high laser reflectivity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Cu-Cr-Zr; Laser powder bed fusion; Strengthening mechanism; Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> coating","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52171044, 92060102); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFA0700703); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","The authors are grateful to the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52171044 and 92060102 ) and the National Key R&D 183 Program of China (No. 2017YFA0700703 ).","Li X.P., Ji G., Chen Z., Addad A., Wu Y., Wang H.W., Vleugels J., Van Humbeeck J., Kruth J.P., Selective laser melting of nano-TiB2 decorated AlSi10Mg alloy with high fracture strength and ductility, Acta Mater., 129, pp. 183-193, (2017); Hu Z., Du Z., Yang Z., Yu L., Ma Z., Preparation of Cu–Cr–Zr alloy by selective laser melting: Role of scanning parameters on densification, microstructure and mechanical properties, Mater.

The user of wireless comprises to fulfill the requirement of users with the problem of limited available Radio frequency (RF) for the varying signal strength in the multipath fading system. However, the 5G wireless communication technology uses the OFDM technology for effective information transmission. Even though the OFDM system exhibits the improved performance in terms of delay, fairness and maximization of the throughput. The conventional OFDM scheme subjected to challenge of ICI and license key. It is necessary to reduce the license key in the OFDM signal with technique such as License Key Partial Transmit sequences (LKPTS), Clipping, Selective Mapping (SLM) and block coding. The conventional technique exhibits the reduction in license key for the higher signal transmit power, BER and higher computational complexity. Among different license key reduction scheme LKPTS is flexible and effective for the varying number of subcarriers in the suitable modulation scheme. In this paper developed a modified partial transmit sequence (MLKPTS) for the reduction of license key in the OFDM signal. In the proposed MLKPTS scheme the sequences are trained based on the superimpose of the OFDM signal for resource allocation. The developed MLKPTS scheme uses the low band and high band estimated Discrete Wavelet transform (DWT). The MLKPTS uses the pulse shaping and interleaving for the selection of the sub carriers in the signal sequences. The pulse shapes are computed and evaluated based on the cyclic drift in the signal pulse sequences. The developed PAR computes the transmitted signal amplitude based on the in-phase and quadrature phase components. The simulation analysis expressed that the proposed MLKPTS scheme significantly reduces the license key in the OFDM signal sequences. © 2022, Ismail Saritas.

The initial LPBF-processed HEA rendered a combination of high strength (ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 810.93 MPa) and ductility (fracture elongation (FE) of 35.43%), which could be attributed to the hierarchical microstructure with fine grains, cellular dislocation structure, and L12 nano-precipitation. When the annealing temperature is increased from 573 K to 1473 K, the cellular dislocation structure is disappeared, and both L12 and B2 phases are progressively precipitated in the FCC matrix. Simultaneously, the tensile strength dramatically increased at the expense of ductility reduced and LPBF-processed HEA demonstrated a high UTS of 1192.84 MPa and FE of 15.32% after annealing at 1173 K. The results reveal that precipitation strengthening plays a significant role in improving the mechanical properties of LPBF-processed HEAs during annealing. For instance, L12 and B2 precipitates hindered the dislocation movement and, in turn, enhanced the pinning force of boundary migration. Moreover, the highly coherent and low misfit FCC-L12 interfaces minimized the strain accumulation due to the dislocation shear and, thereby, prevented the crack initiation. © 2022","Heat treatment; High-entropy alloys (HEAs); Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF); Microstructural evolution; Precipitation strengthening","Annealing; Ductility; Entropy; Fabrication; High-entropy alloys; Precipitation (chemical); Tensile strength; Cellulars; Cr-Fe-Ni; Fracture elongation; High entropy alloys; High-entropy alloy; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; Precipitation strengthening; Ultimate tensile strength; Microstructural evolution","","","","","National Natural Science Fund for Innovative Research Groups, (51621003); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51901004, 52001025, 52171060); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Central South University, CSU; State Key Laboratory of Powder Metallurgy, SKLPM","This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51901004 , 52001025 and 52171060 ), National Natural Science Fund for Innovative Research Groups (Grant No. 51621003 ) and State Key Laboratory of Powder Metallurgy , Central South University , Changsha, China.

With the rapid growth in EVs, there will be a tremendous potential to re-use the remaining EV battery capacities in power systems. Hence, this work focuses on capturing the economic benefits of using such second-life (SL) EV batteries. While previous works mainly focus on bulk storage applications, we demonstrate that the most beneficial route for SL batteries lies in distributed applications in power systems. Specifically, refurbishment and grouping of SL battery packs pose technical and operational challenges, thereby incurring significant costs and risks when large battery packs are adopted in bulk applications. Instead, when distributed at the residential and micro-grid level, such refurbishment costs and operation risks can easily be avoided as only small-size battery packs are required. An experimentally-validated model is incorporated to capture the battery capacity degradation and used to compare fresh batteries and SL-batteries. Using a model predictive control scheme and a 33-bus power network, the benefits of SL-batteries are quantified and verified. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed power systems; Economic analysis; Electric vehicles; Second-life Batteries","Battery Pack; Electric power system economics; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Lithium-ion batteries; Model predictive control; Smart power grids; Battery capacity; Battery pack; Benefit assessments; Distributed power grids; Distributed power systems; Economics analysis; Electric vehicle batteries; Power; Second Life; Second life batteries; Economic analysis","","","","","National University of Singapore, NUS, (A-0009527-01-00)","Ziyou Song is supported by the National University of Singapore Start-Up Grant ( A-0009527-01-00 ).","White C., Thompson B., Swan L.G., Repurposed electric vehicle battery performance in second-life electricity grid frequency regulation service, J.

In this work, we investigated the applicability of magnetic composite sorbents comprising Fe2O3and zeolite 13X in biogas upgrading via a magnetic induction process. The sorbent materials with 10, 15, and 20 wt % Fe2O3content were formulated into monolithic contactors via additive manufacturing and their physiochemical and magnetic properties were assessed accordingly. The effects of Fe2O3particle size, magnetic field intensity, and monolith composition and configuration on CO2and CH4desorption rates as well as heating and cooling rates were systematically investigated. Our results indicated that 5 μm-size Fe2O3with a loading of 20 wt % in the composite is the best performing material exhibiting heating, cooling, and desorption rates of 6.56 °C/min, 3.84 °C/min, and 0.25 mmol CO2/g min, respectively. It was also found that the layer-by-layer printing approach outperforms the homogenously mixed method in formulating magnetic monoliths by exhibiting heating, cooling, and desorption rates of 7.78 °C/min, 4.89 °C/min, and 0.376 mmol CO2/g min, respectively. Lastly, the advantage of induction heating over traditional heating in quickly regenerating the adsorbent was demonstrated. This work highlights the suitability of the induction heating method in upgrading biogas as a renewable source of energy. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

However, efficient synergistic combination of advanced technology and material development is hardly likely to achieve without considering the extreme processing conditions during additive manufacturing. In this study, the addition of 4 wt% Ti-6Al-4V (TC4) alloy powders, the most commercially used Ti alloy powders, into the laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) of 7075 Al alloy was performed and experimentally verified to be capable of eliminating the hot cracks while substantially refining the grains. The as-printed sample was crack-free and had a high relative density of up to 99.95%. Synergy effect of the in-situ formation of Al3(Tix,V1−x) particles that act as the heterogeneous nucleation sites, and the solute effect of the elements Ti and V that possess a high grain growth restriction factor (Q value) in Al matrix can efficiently control the grain growth. After a direct ageing treatment, the resultant alloy displayed an excellent combination of the high ultimate tensile strength (441 ± 3 MPa) and large plasticity (10.1 ± 0.4%). Our work brings new insights between the grain refinement and crack elimination of additively manufactured Al alloys through addition of commercial Ti alloys, benefiting the tailoring and development of new crack-free and dense high-strength Al alloys for L-PBF. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","7075 aluminum alloy; Additive manufacturing; Grain refinement; Laser powder bed fusion; Ti-6Al-4V alloy","3D printers; Additives; Cost effectiveness; Grain growth; Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; High strength alloys; Nucleation; Powders; Tensile strength; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; 7075 aluminum alloy; Al-alloy; Cost-effective approach; Crack free; Grains refinement; High-strength; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; Ti-6al-4v alloy; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Additive Manufacturing of High-performance Materials, (ZDSYS201703031748354); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51801096, 52074157); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, (JCYJ20180305123432756, JCYJ20210324104608023, KQTD20170328154443162); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality; Southern University of Science and Technology, SUSTech; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2021A1313110348); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","The authors are very grateful to National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51801096 , No. 52074157 ), Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (grant No. 2021A1313110348 ), Shenzhen Science and Technology Program (No. JCYJ20180305123432756 , No. JCYJ20210324104608023 , No. KQTD20170328154443162 ), Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Additive Manufacturing of High-performance Materials (No. ZDSYS201703031748354 ).

To satisfy green and safe industrial criteria, it is essential to minimize the emission of smoke and harmful gases generated during the burning of PA12. As a result, utilizing inorganic fullerene-liked tungsten sulfide (IF-WS2) nanoparticles as the precursor and polyethylene glycol (PEG) as the interfacial functional agent, a flame retardant grafted with the –OH functional group on the surface of IF-WS2 nanoparticles was designed and synthesized. Selective laser sintering (SLS) was used to fabricate the PA12/F-IF-WS2 nanocomposites. The multiple –OH groups provided by PEG could enhance the hydrogen bonding active sites of F-IF-WS2 nanoparticles and PA12 molecular chain groups, which could further boost the flame-retardant efficiency of PA12. The apparent decline in the peak heat release (26.55%), peak smoke generation (23%), and total CO production (40.4%) values proved the increased fire safety of the PA12 composite. Depending on the characterization results, a possible flame-retardant mechanism was proposed. Furthermore, the addition of F-IF-WS2 had a decisive effect on mechanical properties, including tensile properties, and dynamic mechanical properties. The PA12/F-IF-WS2 nanocomposites prepared using SLS molding provide a new direction for preparation and flame-retardant applications. © 2022","Fire safety behavior; PA12 nanocomposites; PEG treated IF-WS<sub>2</sub> nanofillers; SLS","Ethers; Fullerenes; Hydrogen bonds; Laser heating; Nanoparticles; Polyethylene oxides; Sintering; Smoke; Sulfur compounds; Synthesis (chemical); Tungsten compounds; Engineering plastics; Fire safety; Fire safety behavior; Inorganic fullerenes; Nanofiller; Poly-amide 12; Polyamide 12 nanocomposite; Polyethylene glycol treated IF-WS2 nanofiller; Safety behavior; Smoke evolution; Nanocomposites","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51972068); Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province, (2020JJB160053); Guangxi Key Lab of Manufacturing System and Advanced Manufacturing Technology, MSAML, (20-065-40S007)","This study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation (51972068), Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi (2020JJB160053), and Guangxi Key Laboratory of Manufacturing Systems and Advanced Manufacturing Technology (20-065-40S007).","Hou Y., Hu Y., Qiu S., Liu L., Xing W., Hu W., Bi2Se3 decorated recyclable liquid-exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets: towards suppress smoke emission and improve mechanical properties of epoxy resin, J.

However, the lower yield strength (YS) and wear resistance of as-cast face-centered cubic (FCC) phase HEAs/MEAs restricts their wide application in industry. In this study, the microstructure evolution, crystallographic orientation, tensile properties and wear resistance of CrCoNi metal matrix composites (MMCs) with different amounts of Mo and WC particles manufactured by directed energy deposition (DED) were systematically analyzed. Microstructure observation revealed that Mo segregated at the cellular boundaries and grain refinement occurred when WC particles were added, but the intensity of< 001 > crystallographic orientation along the build direction did not change significantly. The tensile results show that the YS and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) are increased by 56.18% and 35.45% respectively without significant decrease in ductility (from 46.92% to 42.51%) when 6.5 at% Mo and 2 wt% WC were added. Meanwhile, the wear resistance of Mo6.5 + 2 wt% WC samples are increased by 7.45 times compared with the CrCoNi matrix. These findings provide a new perspective for additive manufacturing (AM) of HEAs/MEAs MMCs with excellent strength-ductility combination and wear resistance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Directed energy deposition; Medium-entropy alloy; Metal matrix composites; Tensile properties; Wear resistance","3D printers; Additives; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Deposition; Ductility; Entropy; Grain refinement; High-entropy alloys; Metallic matrix composites; Microstructure; Molybdenum; Tensile strength; Wear of materials; Directed energy; Directed energy deposition; Energy depositions; High entropy alloys; Matrix composite; Medium entropy; Medium-entropy alloy; Metal matrix; Metal matrix composite; Microstructure evolutions; Wear resistance","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51975112); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, SASTIND, (JCKY2020110C004); State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, SASTIND; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (N180305032, N2103007); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51975112 ), Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities ( N180305032 , N2103007 ) and State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense of China ( JCKY2020110C004 ).

The chemical mixing, phase and microstructure evolution, microhardness distribution and tensile property of Ti basic gradient heterogeneous alloy were investigated through EDS, XRD, SEM, hardness tester and tensile tester. The results indicated that the alloy elements formed a long-distance gradient concentration distribution during the transition between two different titanium alloys due to dilution, remelting, and convective mixing in the molten pool. The intensity of diffraction peaks of Ti basic gradient heterogeneous alloy in the gradient region had no obvious change. The microstructure of MWAAM Ti basic gradient heterogeneous alloy was mainly consisted of lamellar αP, acicular αS, equiaxed αS and β matrix. Different morphology of the αS phase was mainly attributed to the wetting state of the second solid phase and grain boundary. In addition, the microstructure of α phase in Ti basic gradient heterogeneous alloy was significantly changed by the gradient distribution of alloy composition. The gradient heterogeneous alloy component manufactured in this work had high bonding strength. The average UTS of MWAAM Ti basic gradient heterogeneous alloy was 793.14 MPa, which was close to MWAAM TC4 alloy and reached approximately 85% of MWAAM TC11 alloy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Dual-titanium alloy; Gradient heterogeneous structure; Mechanical property; Microstructure evolution; Multi-wire arc additive manufacturing","Additives; Chemical bonds; Grain boundaries; Mixing; Morphology; Textures; Titanium alloys; Wetting; Wire; Alloy components; Dual-titania alloy; Gradient heterogeneous structure; Heterogeneous structures; Microstructure evolutions; Multi-wire arc additive manufacturing; TC11 alloy; TC4 alloys; Titanium (alloys); Wire arc; 3D printing","","","","","Jiangsu Xuzhou Construction Machinery Research Institute Co.

Compared to traditional methods, additive manufacturing (AM) presents great advantages in forming complex ceramic cores, but how to balance the porosity and strength is an enormous challenge. In this work, alumina ceramic cores with high porosity, moderate strength, and low high-temperature deflection were prepared using stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing by a novel powder gradation design strategy. The contradiction between porosity and flexural strength is well adjusted when the mass ratio of the coarse, medium, and fine particles is 2:1:1 and the sintering temperature is 1600 °C. The fracture mode of coarse particles in sintered SLA 3D printing ceramic transforms from intergranular fracture to transgranular fracture with the increase of sintering temperature and the proportion of fine powders in powder system. The sintered porosity has a greater influence on the high-temperature deflection of SLA 3D printed ceramic cores than grain size. On this basis, a ""non-skeleton"" microstructure model of SLA 3D printed alumina ceramic cores is created to explain the relationship between the sintering process and properties. As a result, high porosity (36.4%), appropriate strength (50.1 MPa), and low high-temperature deflection (2.27 mm) were achieved by optimizing particle size gradation and sintering process, which provides an insight into the important enhancement of the comprehensive properties of SLA 3D printed ceramic cores. © 2022","Ceramic cores; Comprehensive properties; Powder gradation design; Sintering temperature; Stereolithography (SLA)","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Particle size; Sintering; Stereolithography; Textures; Turbomachine blades; Alumina ceramic; Ceramic core; Comprehensive properties; Gradation design; High porosity; Highest temperature; Low-high; Powder gradation design; Sintering temperatures; Stereolithography; Porosity","","","","","Innovation Foundation for Doctor Dissertation of Northwestern Polytechnical University, (CX2021056, CX2021066); Joint Research Funds of the Department of Science & Technology of Shaanxi Province; Science and Technology Innovation Team Plan of Shaan Xi Province, (2021TD-17); Youth Innovation Team of Shaanxi Universities; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51822405, 52130204, 52174376); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Northwestern Polytechnical University, NPU, (2020GXLH-Z-024); Northwestern Polytechnical University, NPU; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (D5000210902); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Key Research and Development Projects of Shaanxi Province, (2019ZDLGY 04-04); Key Research and Development Projects of Shaanxi Province; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (21201910250000848); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 52130204 , 52174376 , 51822405 ), Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (No. 21201910250000848), Science and Technology Innovation Team Plan of Shaan Xi Province (No. 2021TD-17), The Youth Innovation Team of Shaanxi Universities, Joint Research Funds of the Department of Science & Technology of Shaanxi Province and NPU ( 2020GXLH-Z-024 ), Key R&D Program of Shaan Xi Province (No. 2019ZDLGY 04-04 ), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. D5000210902 ), and Innovation Foundation for Doctor Dissertation of Northwestern Polytechnical University (Nos.

The heat transfer performance of PCMs filled with traditional metal foams has been extensively investigated both numerically and experimentally. Additive manufactured (AM) lattices with controllable structures have attracted extensive and continuously growing attention due to their high specific strength, interconnected pores, and high thermal conductivity, outperforming both conventional stochastic metal foams and honeycomb with great potential in TSSs. In this work, lattices with novel continue surface structures were inserted into PCMs for heat transfer augmentation. Using the implicit function of triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS), nine lattices with varied relative density, cell sizes, and cell types were designed and fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM) using AlSi10Mg. PCMs embedded by lattices were built by the casting method and adopted in the visualized thermal storage experiment to evaluate the geometric effect on the melting interface, temperature variation, and thermal storage performance under a constant heating power of 10 W. The results showed that the pure paraffin took the longest time of 70 min to completely melt, however, the embedding of a TPMS with a relative density of just 10% reduced the melting time by nearly 20 min. The embedding of TPMS period porous aluminum (PPA) improved the response rate of the paraffin wax (PX) to temperature by accelerating the melting pace and advancing the onset of latent heat energy storage. The relative density plays a dominant role in enhancing thermal conductivity; nonetheless, excessive addition will reduce the heat storage capacity and heat storage density of PCMs. The cell size and cell type could further accelerate the melting rate for more design choices and sheet-like TPMS possesses greater heat transfer potential than rod-like structure. Besides, the GS-65-20 case stored a total amount of 4181.95 J heat at the fastest rate of 1.85 J/s, which was 1.5 times the heat storage rate of the pure PCM case, showing the best-balanced performance. An optimization strategy for thermal conductivity enhancement of lattice structures was provided according to the design priorities of relative density, pore size, and cell type. © 2022","Additive manufacturing (AM); Phase change material (PCM); Thermal conductivity enhancement; Thermal energy storage (TES); Triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS)","Additives; Cells; Cytology; Embeddings; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Melting; Metal foams; Metals; Paraffins; Pore size; Selective laser melting; Stochastic systems; Storage (materials); Thermal conductivity; Thermal energy; Additive manufacturing; Cell types; Phase change material; Relative density; Thermal conductivity enhancement; Thermal energy storage; Thermal storage performance; Triply periodic minimal surface; Triply periodic minimal surfaces; Phase change materials","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52205250); Chongqing University, CQU; Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing, (cstc2020jcyj-zdxmX0021)","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 52205250]; and the Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing, China [grant number cstc2020jcyj-zdxmX0021] for financial support of this work.

This paper places contribution to the existing literature by analyzing the impact of fintech industry on environmental efficiency across selected EU countries. We also utilized indicators like high-tech industry and e-commerce along with fintech industry to better understand the relationship between fourth industrial revolution and environmental efficiency. This study used Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to evaluate environmental efficiency using two different techniques i.e., Slack-Base Measure (SBM) and Epsilon-Based Measure (EBM). Method of Moments Quantile (MMQ) regression is employed as a basic regression technique, while instrumental variables Generalized method of Moments (IV-GMM) is used for robust analysis. The results show that, the overall environmental efficiency of EU countries have improved over the years. As the indicators of the fourth industrial revolution, fintech industry and e-commerce exert a positive effect and improve environmental efficiency; however, high-tech industry reduces environmental efficiency. The results further show that, economic growth and green finance investment promote environmental efficiency, while industrialization and R&D deteriorates it. The results can be of special interest for the policy makers of technological world. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental efficiency; Fintech industry; Fourth industrial revolution; Green finance; High-tech industry","Data envelopment analysis; Electronic commerce; Investments; Method of moments; E- commerces; Environmental efficiency; EU countries; Fintech industry; Fourth industrial revolution; Green finance; High tech industry; Industrial revolutions; Quantile regression; Regression techniques; Efficiency","","","","","Guangdong Province of China, (2021A1515011223, GD20CGL08); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71472126, 71802139)","This research is supported by Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [grant no. 71472126 , 71802139 ] and Guangdong Province of China [grant no.

In such systems, the case of magnetic anisotropy perpendicular to the surface that holds a topologically nontrivial surface state is the most intriguing one. Such materials demonstrate the quantum anomalous Hall effect, which manifests itself as chiral edge conduction channels that can be manipulated by switching the polarization of magnetic domains. In the present paper, we uncover the atomic structure of the bulk and the surface of Mn0.06Sb1.22Bi0.78Te3.06 in conjunction with its electronic and magnetic properties; this material is characterized by naturally formed ferromagnetic layers inside the insulating matrix, where the Fermi level is tuned to the bulk band gap. We found that in such mixed crystals septuple layers (SLs) of Mn(Bi,Sb)2Te4 form structures that feature three SLs, each of which is separated by two or three (Bi,Sb)2Te3 quintuple layers (QLs); such a structure possesses ferromagnetic properties. The surface obtained by cleavage includes terraces with different terminations. Manganese atoms preferentially occupy the central positions in the SLs and in a very small proportion can appear in the QLs, as indirectly indicated by a reshaped Dirac cone.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.","ARPES; electron band structure; ferromagnetism; magnetic topological insulators; photoelectron diffraction; surface structure","Antimony compounds; Atoms; Bismuth compounds; Crystal atomic structure; Electric insulators; Energy gap; Ferromagnetic materials; Magnetic anisotropy; Magnetic domains; Magnetic moments; Quantum Hall effect; Surface states; Surface structure; Tellurium compounds; Topological insulators; Anisotropy perpendicular; ARPES; Electron band structures; Embedded magnetics; Ferromagnetic layers; Magnetic atoms; Magnetic topological insulator; Moments order; Photoelectron diffraction; Topological insulators; Ferromagnetism","","","","","Russian Foundation for Basic Research, РФФИ, (21-52-12024); Saint Petersburg State University, SPbU, (90383050); Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (19-42-06303)","We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Russian Science Foundation (RSF) under Grant No. 19-42-06303.

However, the two sub-tasks require features with various inherency with which to generate inconsistent detections, fettering detectors. In this study, the misalignment is deeply analyzed via kernel density estimation (KDE) for the first time. Moreover, to address the misalignment, a plug-and-play detection head, named Diff-Head, is devised and embedded in one-stage detectors. Concretely, the authors merge parallel branches into a semi-parallel structure, establishing the correlation between classification and regression. In the regression branch, a feature difference module (FDM) gets rid of the features that favour classification by subtracting salient object features from the original feature map, and position encoding (PE) modules enhance the absolute position information. The flexibility and efficiency of the detection head are retained. Experiments on Pascal visual object classes (VOC) and MS COCO demonstrate that Diff-Head is effective and achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art detectors. Meanwhile, the amount of parameters is reduced at least 30% and 83.0% average precision (AP) is achieved on Pascal VOC. The analyses of consistency and error show that Diff-Head has better localization and the capability of mitigating the misalignment. © 2022 The Authors.

A total of 76 tensile coupons, 76 hardness test specimens, and 25 stub columns were fabricated from 304L stainless steel powders by the SLM technique. Tension coupon tests and hardness tests were conducted to determine the mechanical properties. Residual stresses and local geometric imperfections of the stub columns were measured. The effects of coupon specimen orientations, thicknesses, and annealing conditions on the measured material properties were explored. In addition, the failure modes, ultimate load-carrying capacities and structural responses of the stub columns with four different cross-sections under axial compression were obtained and analyzed to evaluate the cross-sectional behavior. The test results of ultimate strengths were compared with the predictions calculated from the current design methods. The test results showed that the tensile strength of the coupon perpendicular to the building direction was higher than that of the coupon parallel to the building direction. Moreover, the tensile strength of the coupon increased with the increase of the coupon thickness. Considering the cross-sectional behavior, the square hollow section (SHS) and circular hollow section (CHS) had greater cross-sectional axial capacities than the rectangular hollow section (RHS) and elliptical hollow section (EHS), respectively. The introduction of a single stiffener in SHS and CHS reduced the load-carrying capacities to a certain extent. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","304L stainless steel; Additive manufacturing (AM); Selective laser melting (SLM);

The interdependency between imperfections and processing parameters remains unclear. Here, the evolution of porosity and humps during LPBF using X-ray and electron imaging, and a high-fidelity multiphase process simulation, is quantified. The pore and keyhole formation mechanisms are driven by the mixing of high temperatures and high metal vapor concentrations in the keyhole is revealed. The irregular pores are formed via keyhole collapse, pore coalescence, and then pore entrapment by the solidification front. The mixing of the fast-moving vapor plume and molten pool induces a Kelvin–Helmholtz instability at the melt track surface, forming humps. X-ray imaging and a high-fidelity model are used to quantify the pore evolution kinetics, pore size distribution, waviness, surface roughness, and melt volume under single layer conditions. This work provides insights on key criteria that govern the formation of imperfections in LPBF and suggest ways to improve process reliability. © 2022 The Authors.

But it is intrinsically brittle and crack-prone, which lowers the processability of laser additive manufacturing (LAM) that offers an effective pathway for material processing and design. Thus, improving the mechanical properties, particularly the room temperature plasticity, of LAMed β-solidifying TiAl alloy is of technical interest and theoretical importance. Based on previous results, the present work investigates the synergistic roles of La and B in grain refinement and crack elimination in a LAMed β-solidifying TiAl alloy with LaB6 addition (0–2 wt%). Results show that La2O3 and TiB in-situ formed via reaction between the β-solidifying TiAl and the added LaB6 nanoparticles. Microstructural feature, phase transformation texture and mechanical properties at both room and high temperatures can be optimized through controlling the LaB6 addition level. 0.5 wt% LaB6 has been determined as the optimized addition, at which the balanced mechanical properties at both room temperature and 800 °C can be achieved for the LAMed β-solidifying TiAl alloy. Excessive LaB6 addition led to agglomeration of in-situ formed precipitates, reducing density and therefore deteriorating mechanical properties. The study offers an in-depth understanding of the effective grain refining approach to overcome the intrinsic brittle nature of β-solidifying TiAl through optimized doping of LaB6. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Mechanical properties; Phase transformation; β-solidifying TiAl alloy","Additives; Cracks; Density (specific gravity); Grain refinement; Phase transitions; Refining; Selective laser melting; Textures; Titanium alloys; Crack free; High-temperature properties; Laser additive manufacturing; Materials design; Materials processing; Phases transformation; Processability; TiAl alloy; Β-solidifying tial alloy; γ-TiAl based alloy; Binary alloys","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51971108, 52271032); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2020A1515011373); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2019B010943001, 2019B090907001); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province","This study is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 51971108 and 52271032 ), Research and Development Program Project in Key Areas of Guangdong Province (Grants No. 2019B090907001 and 2019B010943001 ), and Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province ( 2020A1515011373 ).

The parts are built in a layer-by-layer fashion during PBF-LB, and changing the processing parameters within different layers can lead to the modification of microstructures and finally a great impact on the mechanical properties. Thus, PBF-LB provides the possibility for the customization of material properties by changing the microstructures of layers using different processing parameters. In this investigation, a twin PBF-LB system, i.e., with a low-power laser beam and a high-power laser beam in a machine, is used to produce fine and coarse microstructures using the Inconel 718 (IN718) alloy, respectively. The fine and coarse microstructures are alternately printed to form different heterogeneous structures. Correspondingly, different mechanical properties are achieved. The microstructures are analyzed using optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and numerical calculation. The defects generated by these 2 laser beams are simultaneously discussed. This study facilitates the tailoring of alloy properties using the PBF-LB technology to meet the users’ needs of multiple service conditions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Heterogeneous structure; Mechanical property; Microstructure; Nickel-based superalloy; Powder bed fusion","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52074157, 91860131); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, (JCYJ20170817111811303, KQTD20170328154443162, ZDSYS201703031748354); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFB0702901); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","The authors would like to thank the support from National Natural Science Foundation of China with the project numbers of 91860131 and 52074157 , National Key Research and Development Program of China with the project number of 2017YFB0702901 , Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission with the project numbers of JCYJ20170817111811303 , KQTD20170328154443162 and ZDSYS201703031748354 .","You X., Tan Y., Zhao L., You Q., Wang Y., Ye F., Effect of solution heat treatment on microstructure and electrochemical behavior of electron beam smelted Inconel 718 superalloy, J.

Compared to the conventional wrought 316L SS, the significantly coarser grain size was characterized in the directly AMed specimen, resulting in unacceptable mechanical properties as safety-critical parts. These coarse grains can be refined through the subsequent hot compression process. However, the detailed grain refinement process in these AMed materials has not been exploited. This motivates the study of the grain refinement of AM specimens through dynamic recrystallization (DRX) in hot compression. Hot compression was applied on AMed 316L SS specimens at temperatures from 800 °C to 1000 °C and different strain rates of 0.01 s−1, 0.1 s−1 and 1 s−1 by Gleeble. The results were compared with conventional wrought-annealed 316L SS specimens. To explain the flow stress behaviour, the underlying grain size, orientations, morphologies, and geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) density distribution and evolution were characterized by the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The results suggest that the initial microstructure difference plays a dominant role in the flow stress response, and the DRX behaves very differently in these AMed and wrought-annealed specimens. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","316L stainless steel; Dynamic recrystallization; Microstructure characterization; Stress-strain curve; Thermomechanical processing","Additives; Austenitic stainless steel; Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; Microstructure; Plastic flow; Safety engineering; Strain rate; Stress-strain curves; 316 L stainless steel; Behavior evolution; Compression process; Deformation microstructure; Dynamic recrystallisation; Hot deformation behaviors; Microstructure characterization; Steel specimens; Stress/strain curves; Thermomechanical processing; Dynamic recrystallization","","","","","CRRC Industrial Academy Co.; CRRC Industrial Academy Co.

Melt pool structures of different special sizes can be obtained by adjusting the laser power and scanning speed during the SLM process. In this work, the split-Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) is used to conduct dynamic impact on the SLM-NiCrFeCoMo0.2 HEA samples with different molten pool size. The X-ray diffractometer (XRD), the scanning electron microscope (SEM), the electron probes micro-analyzer (EPMA) and the transmission electron microscope (TEM) were used to characterize the microstructure and deformation characteristics of the of the molten pool. The SLM-NiCrFeCoMo0.2 HEA shows high impact energy absorption density and compressive strength at high strain rate. Volume energy density (VED) refers to the power delivered by the laser per unit volume of material during a SLM process, which can affect the size of the molten pool formed. Mo-rich σ phase precipitations are distributed near the molten pool boundary. In the cooling stage of the SLM process, the center of the molten pool has a faster cooling rate than the molten pool boundary, so area near the boundary stays in the temperature range where the precipitation occurs for a longer time, which is the reason why the precipitates are concentrated near the boundary. The precipitation strengthening in the SLM-NiCrFeCoMo0.2 HEA is considered by measuring the relationship between the molten pool structure and the precipitation distribution, considering the material as a composite of the precipitation dense region (PDR) and the precipitation free region (PFR), and the strength contribution of precipitation is estimated by mixing rules. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic mechanical properties; High entropy alloy; Microstructure; Selection laser melting","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52020105013); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; State Key Laboratory of Powder Metallurgy, SKLPM, (62102172); State Key Laboratory of Powder Metallurgy, SKLPM","The present work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52020105013 ), and by the State Key Laboratory of Powder Metallurgy (No. 62102172 ).","Liu W.H., Lu Z.P., He J.Y., Luan J.H., Wang Z.J., Liu B., Liu Y., Chen M.W., Liu C.T., Ductile CoCrFeNiMo<sub>x</sub> high entropy alloys strengthened by hard intermetallic phases, Acta Mater., 116, pp. 332-342, (2016); Zhu Z.G., Nguyen Q.B., Ng F.L., An X.H., Liao X.Z., Liaw P.K., Nai S.M.L., Wei J., Hierarchical microstructure and strengthening mechanisms of a CoCrFeNiMn high entropy alloy additively manufactured by selective laser melting, Scr.

Notwithstanding this, the primary purpose of this paper is to examine the board characteristics and carbon emission performance. This study applied the fixed effect model, 2SLS, and multiple regression analyses data from 220 non-financial listed companies on the BSE index and covering a period of 7 years from FY 2014-15 to FY 2020-21. The estimated results confirmed that board size, board meetings, board gender diversity, CEO duality, and ownership concentration have a negative association with carbon emission performance. In addition, board independence and the environmental committee are found to be positively associated with carbon emission performance based on 2 SLS and multiple regression analyses, and these results imply that they improve carbon performance. Overall, this study's shreds of evidence suggest that governing boards tend to pay attention to company's carbon performance and without mitigating original carbon performance is not likely to reduced GHGs emissions. This study's outcomes have significant implications for policymakers, corporate bodies, creditors, and regulators regarding the efficiency of corporate governance mechanisms in communicating climate change risks. However, corporate boards can use these results to find positive aspects of companies and formulate possible corporate governance modifications in relation to carbon policies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission performance; Climate change; Corporate governance; GHGs emissions; India","Carbon; Greenhouse gases; Regression analysis; Carbon emission performance; Carbon emissions; Carbon performance; Corporate governance; Corporates; Emissions performance; GHG emission; GHGs emissions; India; Multiple regression analysis; Climate change","","","","","","","Ahmed K., Hossain M., Adams M.B., The effects of board composition and board size on the informativeness of annual accounting earnings, Corp.

This study deals with the design and simulation of a bearing housing made from titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) using the selective laser melting (SLM) technique. The Finite Element Analysis (FEA) method was used for assessing the suitability of Ti6Al4V for aerospace application. The choice of Ti6Al4V is due to the comparative advantage of its strength-to-weight ratio. The implicit and explicit modules of the Abaqus software were employed for the non-linear and linear analyses of the component part. The results obtained revealed that the titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) sufficiently meets the design, functional and service requirements of the bearing housing component produced for aerospace application. The designed bearing is suitable for a high speed and temperature application beyond 1900 K, while the maximum stress induced in the component during loading was 521 kPa. It is evident that the developed stresses do not result in a distortion or deformation of the material with yield strength in the region of 820 MPa. This work provides design data for the development of a bearing housing for AM under the technique of SLM using Ti6Al4V by reflecting the knowledge of the material behaviour under the operating conditions. © 2022 The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; bearing housing; FEA; titanium alloy","","","","","","DST-CSIR; Research Chairs; Tshwane University of Technology Pretoria; Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, South Africa, CSIR; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी","Research support acknowledgements goes to the Department of Science and Technology in collaboration with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, (DST-CSIR), and the Research Chairs (Gibela) at the Industrial Engineering Department of Tshwane University of Technology Pretoria, all situated in South Africa.","Haghighi S.

In this method, living cells are incorporated within bioinks, extruded layer by layer into a granular support material followed by gelation of the bioink through diverse cross-linking mechanisms. This approach offers high fidelity and precise fabrication of complex structures mimicking living tissue properties. However, the transition of cell mass mixed with the bioink into functional native-like tissue requires post-printing cultivation in vitro. An often-overlooked drawback of 3D bioprinting is the nonuniform shrinkage and deformation of printed constructs during the post-printing tissue maturation period, leading to highly variable engineered constructs with unpredictable size and shape. This limitation poses a challenge for the technology to meet applicative requirements. A novel technology of “print-and-grow,” involving 3D bioprinting and subsequent cultivation in κ-Carrageenan-based microgels (CarGrow) for days is presented. CarGrow enhances the long-term structural stability of the printed objects by providing mechanical support. Moreover, this technology provides a possibility for live imaging to monitor tissue maturation. The “print-and-grow” method demonstrates accurate bioprinting with high tissue viability and functionality while preserving the construct's shape and size. © 2022 The Authors.

In situ X-ray CT in probing the mechanism and kinetics of localized corrosion is demonstrated by immersing two LPBF specimens with different porosities in an aggressive ferric chloride solution for the evaluation of corrosion. X-ray CT images are acquired from the specimens after every 8 hours of immersion over an extended period of time (216 hours). Corrosion pit growth is then quantitatively analyzed with a data-constrained modeling method. The pitting growth mechanism of LPBF stainless steel is found to be different from that of conventional stainless steels. More specifically, the mechanism of corrosion pit initiation is closely correlated with the original lack of fusion porosity (LOF) distribution on the surface of the specimens and preferential pit propagation through the LOF pores inside the specimens. Pit growth kinetics are derived from pit volume changes determined through 3D data analysis. The pit growth kinetics in LPBF specimens are found to vary in the initial pit formation, competitive pit propagation, and the dominant pit growth stages. © 2022 The Authors.

However, the printability of 3DP mortars is the main factor restricting the rapid development of cement-based 3DP technology. The nano-TiO2 (NT) performs obviously self-cleaning effect and has potential merit in improving the printability in cement-based 3DP as an additive. In this study, the printing pastes with different NT dosages and water-cement ratios are designed to reveal the fresh and hardened properties of cement-based 3DP. The test results show that NT has better thickening property and can shorten the setting time, thus reducing the slump and flow diameter. What's more, appropriate NT content can increase the static yield stress of pastes, and reduce the dynamic yield stress and plastic viscosity of pastes at the same time. The mortar with 3% NT dosage has better buildability, compared with undoped NT group, the deformation-rate of the sample increases by 32.4% and the inclination-rate decreases by 52.7%. The mortar with 3% NT dosage also has better density and compressive strength, compared with undoped NT group, the dry density increases by 19.6% and the compressive strength increases by 51.6%. Moreover, the results also indicated that when the water-cement ratio of paste is smaller, its fluidity is smaller, and its static yield stress, dynamic yield performance as well as plastic viscosity are higher. Micro-pores and hydration products of 3DP samples tested by SEM and XRD showed that the NT can refine the pore structure and reinforce the compactness of the mixtures, and the self-cleaning test verified that NT also had obvious self-cleaning performance for cement-based printed samples, which indicates the NT is an ideal 3DP cement additive for clean production and green development in civil construction. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3D print material; Cement-based 3D printing; Nano-TiO<sub>2</sub>; Printability; Self-cleaning properties","3D printers; Additives; Carbon dioxide; Cements; Cleaning; Compressive strength; Global warming; Hardening; Hydration; Mortar; Pore structure; Titanium dioxide; Viscosity; 3-D printing; 3d print material; 3d prints; 3D-printing; Cement-based; Cement-based 3d printing; Nano-TiO 2; Print materials; Printability; Self-cleaning properties; Yield stress","","","","","Major Scientific Equipment Project of State Key Laboratory of Geomechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, (E01I011501); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (U1965205); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This research was financially supported by the financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U1965205 ), Major Scientific Equipment Project of State Key Laboratory of Geomechanics and Geotechnical Engineering (No. E01I011501 ).","pp. 1346-2011; Abdalla J.A., Thomas B.S., Hawileh R.A., Yang J., Jindal B.B., Ariyachandra E., Influence of nano-TiO2, nano-Fe2O3, nanoclay and nano-CaCO3 on the properties of cement/geopolymer concrete, Clean.

Methodology: The two-dimensional and three-dimensional surface morphology and multi-scale surface roughness analysis of all Ti6Al4V samples were performed using an opto-digital microscope (with extended focus imaging coupled with high dynamic range imaging). Moreover, the scanning electron microscope, microhardness tester, and X-ray diffraction techniques were used to analyze the microstructural and microhardness values. Findings: (1) The lath thickness was relatively thicker in the LPBF-processed Ti6Al4V sample’s microstructure at central locations than in the top and bottom locations. (2) The areal surface roughness (Sa), Rk, and Sk values were relatively lower for the middle region than for the bottom and top regions of the thin-walled part, implying nonuniform surface topography along the build direction. (3) The middle region had a higher surface texture and texture amplitude symmetry periodicity than the top and bottom regions along the build direction. Value: Overall, the established methodology employed on the thin-walled Ti6Al4V part processed using LPBF technology enables the selection criteria of a suitable surface finishing process to achieve isotropic finish for practical industrial applications.

In the body, blood vessels are organized into distinct patterns that enable optimal nutrient delivery and oxygen exchange. Mimicking these same patterns in engineered tissue matrices is a critical challenge for cell and tissue transplantation. Here, we leverage bioprinting to assemble endothelial cells in to organized networks of large (>100 μm) diameter blood vessel grafts to enable spatial control of vessel formation in vivo. Acellular PEG/GelMA matrices with perfusable channels were bioprinted and laminar flow was confirmed within patterned channels, beneficial for channel endothelialization and consistent wall shear stress for endothelial maturation. Next, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were seeded within the patterned channel and maintained under perfusion culture for multiple days, leading to cell-cell coordination within the construct in vitro. HUVEC and human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) were additionally added to bulk matrix to further stimulate anastomosis of our bioprinted vascular grafts in vivo. Among multiple candidate matrix designs, the greatest degree of biomaterial vascularization in vivo was seen within matrices fabricated with HUVECs and hMSCs encapsulated within the bulk matrix and HUVECs lining the walls of the patterned channels, dubbed design M-C_E. For this lead design, vasculature was detected within the endothelialized, perfusable matrix channels as early as two weeks and αSMA+ CD31+ vessels greater than 100 μm in diameter had formed by eight weeks, resulting in durable and mature vasculature. Notably, vascularization occurred within the endothelialized, bioprinted channels of the matrix, demonstrating the ability of bioprinted perfusable structures to guide vascularization patterns in vivo. The ability to influence vascular patterning in vivo can contribute to the future development of vascularized tissues and organs. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Biocompatible Materials; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; Blood; Cytology; Endothelial cells; Laminar flow; Shear flow; Shear stress; Tissue; alpha smooth muscle actin; buprenorphine; gelatin methacryloyl; hydrogel; isoflurane; macrogol; platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1; sodium chloride; unclassified drug; biomaterial; Bulk matrices; Cell-be; Cell/B.E; Cell/BE; Human umbilical vein endothelial cells; In-vivo; matrix; Mesenchymal stromal cells; Vascularization; Vasculature; anastomosis; angiogenesis; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; bioprinting; blood vessel graft; body patterning; cell culture; cell maturation; controlled study; dehydration; encapsulation; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; laminar flow; male; mesenchymal stroma cell; mouse; nonhuman; pain; shear stress; umbilical vein endothelial cell; vascularization; chemistry; neovascularization (pathology); procedures; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; Blood vessels","","buprenorphine, 52485-79-7, 53152-21-9; isoflurane, 26675-46-7; macrogol, 25322-68-3; sodium chloride, 7647-14-5, 23724-87-0, 49658-21-1; Biocompatible Materials, ","Eclipse Ti, Nikon Instruments, United States; FIJI; ISMATEC, Cole Parmer; MATLAB v.

FDM is a well-known method of 3D printing on plastics, however, now it can be used for printing on metallic materials as well. For the past few decades, the polymer material is one of the most preferred choices of material studied for 3D printing especially to produce implants. In this study, nano-Hydroxyaptite incorporated with Polycaprolactone and Polylactic Acid (PCL/PLA/n-HA) are designed to inform of a scaffold with different porosity and compression performance were tested using ANSYS simulation. Combining n-HA into a PCL / PLA composite offers alternative options for the FDM raw material filament formula for a biomedical scaffold. For scaffold design, the dimensions are 10 mm x 10 mm x 10 mm in size. The porosity of the scaffold is set at 35.3%, 47.06%, and 70.59%, which are necessary to study the porosity value of the scaffold that performs under the compression mode. Next, the scaffold was tested via simulation by using Finite Element Analysis in SolidWorks 2020. The mechanical properties analyzed through compression in SolidWorks 2020 is Von Mises Stress, Equivalent Strain, and Resultant Force and the compression value are set at 20N, 30N, 40N, 50N, and 60N respectively. Throughout the analysis, PNC 2 with a porosity of 47.06% resulted in the lowest minimum stress and intermediate value in maximum stress in Von Mises. An equivalent strain through this analysis showed that PNC 2 with a porosity of 47.06% has the ideal characteristics where it has the highest minimum stress and the intermediate maximum strain. In resultant displacement, PNC 3 with 70.59% porosity resulted in the highest value in resultant displacement and it is not an ideal characteristic for a scaffold design in bone regeneration. Overall, PNC 2 with a porosity of 47.06% has shown the most ideal characteristics in Von Mises, Equivalent Strain, and Resultant Displacement and is ideal for scaffold fabrication using PCL/PLA/n-HA composite through 3D printing. © 2006-2022 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

In this research, we investigated the influence of three process parameters, namely build orientation, printing speed, and layer thickness, on CFR-PEEK prints’ tensile and compressive strengths through a full-factorial designed experiment. Two designs (i.e., ASTM D695 and ASTM D638) were used to fabricate CFR-PEEK parts in FFF printers. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) test revealed that the main and two-way interaction effects, except the interaction between printing speed and layer thickness, were statistically significant process parameters for tensile strength. The highest tensile strength was achieved at horizontal orientation, lower printing speed, and lower layer thickness. However, the compressive strength of the prints was only impacted by the main effects of build orientation and layer thickness. The combination of vertical orientation, lower printing speed, and lower layer thickness led to the maximum compressive strength. Two general linear prediction models were established to obtain higher tensile and compressive strengths in prints through deriving process parameter settings. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","CFR-PEEK; Fused filament fabrication; Mechanical strength; Process parameters","3D printers; Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Compressive strength; Ethers; Ketones; Tensile strength; Carbon fiber reinforced; Carbon-fiber-reinforced poly-ether-ether-ketone; Fused filament fabrication; Layer thickness; Mechanical; Mechanical strength; Poly ether ether ketones; Poly(ether ether ketones); Printing speed; Process parameters; Fabrication","","","","","MIST; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1723736); National Science Foundation, NSF; Center for Selective C-H Functionalization, National Science Foundation; Center for Hierarchical Manufacturing, National Science Foundation, CHM, NSF; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (2018R1C1B5040256); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work was partially supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by the Korea government (MIST) (No. 2018R1C1B5040256) for Kijung Park.

Controlling the distribution of residual stress caused by the high cooling rate and temperature gradient is the key to regulating the performance of devices obtained from additive manufacturing. In this work, the effects of the interlayer scanning angle on the residual stress in Ti–6Al–4V parts manufactured by selective laser melting were investigated by finite element simulations. We studied how changing the interlayer deflection angle alleviated residual stress under different energy inputs. The results showed that the residual stress in the z-direction was reduced by the deflection angle of 67° and 90°, and the non-uniform distribution of residual stress was reduced by a deflection angle of 67°. The combination of a chessboard pattern and interlayer deflection angle greatly alleviated the generation of residual stress. This work has important guiding significance for the additive manufacturing design of high-quality and high-performance titanium alloy devices.

However, the adhesion between different materials at the boundary interface in FDM multi-material printing is a limiting factor. These studies are concerned with improving and study the adhesion between two polymers. Design/methodology/approach: Due to the numerous applications and possibilities of 3D printed objects, combining different materials has become a subject of interest. PLA is an alternative to the use of petrochemical-based polymers. Thermoplastic Polyurethane is a flexible material that can achieve different characteristics when combined with a rigid filament, such as PLA. To improve the adhesion between PLA and TPU in multi-material FFF/FDM, we propose the comparison of different processes: post-processing with acetone immersion, surface activation during printing with Acetone, surface activation during printing with tetrahydrofuran, post-processing annealing, and connection of printed parts with tetrahydrofuran. Findings: Modifying the 3D printing process improved the quality of the adhesive bond between the two different polymers. Activation of the surface with THF is the treatment method recommended by the authors due to the low impact on the deformation/degradation of the object. Research limitations/implications: In the study, adhesion was considered in relation to the circular pattern of surface development. Further analysis should include other surface development patterns and changes in printing parameters, e.g. process temperatures and layer application speed. Practical implications: 3D printing with multi-materials, such as PLA biopolymer and thermoplastic polyurethane, allows for the creation of flexible connections. The strengthening of the biopolymer broadens the possibilities of using polylactide. Examples of applications include: automotive (elements, where flexible TPU absorbs vibrations and protects PLA from cracking), medicine (prostheses with flexible elements ensuring mobility in the joints). Originality/value: Multi-material printing is a new trend in 3D printing research, and this research is aimed at promoting the use and expanding the possibilities of using PLA biopolymer. © 2022 by the authors.","Adhesion; FDM; Multi-material printing; PLA; TPU","","","","","","Foundation of the Lodz University of Technology; Fundacja Politechniki Łódzkiej","Funding text 1: The research was financed by the Foundation of the Lodz University of Technology (Fundacja Politechniki Łdó zkiej) and presented during scientific conference Materials Engineering - Materials and Technologies “IMMT 2022”, Łódź -Słok, 20-23 November 2022.; Funding text 2: The research was financed by the Foundation of the Lodz University of Technology (Fundacja Politechniki Łódzkiej) and presented during scientific conference Materials Engineering-Materials and Technologies “IMMT 2022”, Łódź-Słok, 20-23 November 2022.","Horn T.J., Harrysson O.L.A., Overview of Current Additive Manufacturing Technologies and Selected Applications, Science Progress, 95, 3, pp. 255-282, (2012); Dudek P., FDM 3D Printing Technology in Manufacturing Composite Elements, Archives of Metallurgy and Materials, 58, 4, pp. 1415-1418, (2013); Surange V.G., Gharat P.V., 3D Printing Process Using Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM), International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology, 3, 3, pp. 1403-1406, (2016); Patel R., Desai C., Kushwah S., Mangrola M.H., A Review Article on FDM Process Parameters in 3D Printing for Composite Materials, Materials Today: Proceedings, 60, 3, pp. 2162-2166, (2022); Tumer E.H., Erbil H.Y., Extrusion-Based 3D Printing Applications of PLA Composites: A Review, Coatings, 11, 4, (2021); Guo N., Leu M.C., Additive Manufacturing: Technology, Applications, and Research Needs, Frontiers of Mechanical Engineering, 8, 3, pp. 215-243, (2013); Vaezi M., Seitz H., Yang S., A Review on 3D Micro-Additive Manufacturing Technologies, The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 67, 5-8, pp. 1721-1754, (2013); Turner B.N., Strong R., Gold S.A., A Review of Melt Extrusion Additive Manufacturing Processes: I.

The optimal BN content was determined as 0.5 wt%, and a near-full density was achieved with optimized process parameters. The microstructure of the printed composite consisted of α-Ti matrix doped with N, as well as nano-sized TiN and TiB precipitates. The ultimate tensile strength of the printed composite sample was enhanced by ∼85% from ∼590 MPa to ∼1100 MPa as compared with the pure Ti counterpart, whereas the elongation was reduced to ∼3%. This research provides insights into the additive manufacturing of metal composites with near-full density and enhanced mechanical strength. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Laser powder bed fusion; Metal matrix composite; Titanium","","","","","","","","Tjong S.C., Ma Z.Y., Microstructural and mechanical characteristics of in situ metal matrix composites, Mater.

Although the traditional initialization for the prediction, i.e., through assimilating the satellite-derived sea level anomalies (SLA) into a model, has some improvement, it is yet unable to predict well the main characteristics of a mesoscale eddy, including its three-dimensional (3D) structure, moving track, size, and intensity. In this study, a vortex-implanted initialization scheme for the mesoscale eddy prediction (VISTMEP) is developed. With the VISTMEP, a bogus vortex is first constructed in terms of 3D SLA-derived currents, and then it is implanted into the model initial field to obtain a more accurate 3D current field of a mesoscale eddy for prediction. The results from idealized experiments show that the VISTMEP can significantly improve prediction of the mesoscale eddy with a longer valid prediction length up to 30 days compared to the experiment with the traditional initialization. Detailed analysis indicates that, as the model is integrated forward, a more “realistic” 3D structure of the eddy in terms of both current and temperature fields is formed when the VISTMEP is employed, leading to the improvement of the eddy prediction regarding to the moving track, size, and intensity of the eddy, which is largely influenced by the accuracy of the initial current field of the eddy obtained by the VISTMEP. This study provides an innovative method for the mesoscale eddy prediction, which could have great potential application in operational services of the marine environments.

However, conventional manufacturing processes pose many challenges for the fabrication and processing of Ti-6Al-4V alloy-based implants. The emerging additive manufacturing technologies, particularly selective laser melting, provide an ideal platform for manufacturing customized and complex-geometry implants with high-dimensional accuracy. This study evaluates the mechanical properties, and bio-corrosion resistance of selective laser melted Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The microstructural analysis showed the presence of a continuous networked structure of the β phase, which paved the way for an ample microhardness of 255 HV. A comprehensive analysis of the fracture mechanism and bio-corrosion mechanism of the selective laser melted Ti-6Al-4V alloy is presented. The fractography depicted a combination of ductile and brittle fracture mechanisms, resulting in a fair ultimate tensile strength value of 813 MPa. Meanwhile, the formation of calcium hydroxyapatite in the course of corrosion during the implantation period helps in bone growth and promotes implant–bone stability. The corrosion rate of the SLM Ti-6Al-4V alloy in simulated body fluid was 9 × 10–4 mm/year. The results provide a new avenue to fabricate selective laser melted Ti-6Al-4V alloy with desired mechanical properties and bio-corrosion resistance.

Structurally hierarchical micro-laminate of CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloy (HEA)-based HEA−TiNp/HEA MMC was built by the MM-SLM to overcome the strength-ductility trade-off and improve the anti-impact performance under high strain-rate compression deformation. The dynamic impacts were performed on the SLM-built HEA and MM-SLM-built HEA−TiNp/HEA using a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) system, with the strain rates of 1000 s−1, 2000 s−1, and 3000 s−1. The structurally hierarchical HEA−TiNp/HEA exhibited higher strength and deformability than the HEA. The strain-rate-dependent work hardening capacity and macroscopic plasticity of the HEA−TiNp/HEA indicated a better resistance to dynamic shocks. The promising results pave a road for achieving high-performance HEA-based MMCs of the MM-SLM-built hierarchical structures with a relatively low proportion of nano-ceramic reinforcements and bimodal-grained HEA matrix. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; High-entropy alloy; Metal matrix composite; Multi-material selective laser melting","","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai, (20ZR1414000); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52175140); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work is financially sponsored by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52175140 ), Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai , in China (Grant No. 20ZR1414000 ).

This study aims to provide a process flow detailing all the stages starting from the acquisition of radiological images from different imaging modalities; such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to the printing of the bone morphology and finite element analysis; including the validation process. Materials & Methods: First, the CT scan of a lower abdomen area of a patient was converted into a 3D image using interactive medical imaging control system software. The segmentation process was applied to isolate the femoral head from the soft tissue and the pelvic bone. After the roughness errors and the gaps in the segments were removed using the 3Matic software, the file was converted to stereolithography (STL) file format to transfer to the 3D printer. The printing process was carried out via commercial powder-based Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) printer. The subject-specific femoral head model was formed in 3D. The Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of the femoral head was performed using a commercial FE software package. Results: The results show that experimental analysis and the CT scan-based FEA were compatible both for the stress distributions and the strain values as predicted by the models (R2=0.99). The deviation was calculated as approximately 12% between the experimental results and the Finite Element (FE) results. In addition, it was observed that the SLS technique produced useful results for modeling biomedical tissues with about 24x faster prototyping time. Conclusion: The prescribed process flow could be utilized in clinical settings for the pre-planning of the surgeries (≈428 minutes for femoral head) and also as an educational tool in the biomedical engineering field. © 2022 AGBM","Educational tools;

However, the characterization of the effective mechanical properties of additively manufactured metamaterials is of great value prior their incorporation in any application. Nowadays, their mechanical characterization is focused, primarily, on elastic static loading scenarios. In this work, the viscoelasticity of novel metamaterials with various lattice topologies and their constituent material was evaluated by means of experimental measurements. The lattice metamaterials were designed using Bézier curves to form their constituent elements and fabricated using flexible resin via vat photopolymerization. The creep compliance of these Bézier lattices was compared to that of a square lattice, observing a reduction as the curvature of the constituent element increased. Overall, the results presented here demonstrate that the viscoelastic properties of a structured media can be altered not only by modifying the constituent material, but also by adjusting the material arrangement within the structure. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Creep; Lattice metamaterials; Viscoelasticity","3D printers; Additives; Creep; Fabrication; Metamaterials; Photopolymerization; Complex geometries; Constituent elements; Constituent materials; Effective mechanical properties; Lattice metamaterial; Lattice topology; Mechanical; Mechanical characterizations; Photo polymerization; Static loading; Viscoelasticity","","","","","","","Kumar N.S., Naidu K.C.B., Banerjee P., Babu T.A., Reddy B.V.S., A review on metamaterials for device applications, Crystals, 11, pp. 1-23, (2021); Kadic M., Milton G.W., van Hecke M., Wegener M., 3D metamaterials, Nat.

This work proposes an electrostatic driven self-assembly approach to prepare graphene platelets (GnPs)-coated polyamide (PA) nanocomposite powders for SLS process. Morphology and microstructure characterizations confirmed the synthesis of ∼3-nm-thick GnPs with high structural integrity which contributed to the mechanical properties, electrical and thermal conductivity of the nanocomposites. The study showed that unlike to traditional plastic processing methods, SLS process can develop strong and electrically conductive parts using only 0.2 wt% of GnPs; at this content, percolation threshold was observed (between 0.2 wt% and 1.0 wt%) and Young's modulus increased by 81%. This work indicates that introducing graphene platelets into SLS process is an effective approach in order to prepare polymer nanocomposites with high mechanical, electrical and thermal properties. Furthermore, a numerical model was developed to simulate the quasi-static mechanical behavior of the 3D printed neat PA and its GnP nanocomposites. The developed model is in accord with the experimental measurements; this would be a benchmark model to pre-design and predict the mechanical behavior of various profiles before 3D printing. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Electrical conductivity; FEM; Graphene; Mechanical properties; Polyamide","","","","","","SLS-printed; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51973123, 52173077); Department of Education of Liaoning Province, (LJK0187)","Funding text 1: Polyamide (PA) is one of the most widely used engineering polymer because of its high impact strength, high fracture resistance, good thermal stability and high processability. Therefore, PA is quite demanded in aerospace and automotive industry. However, these industries require two major features: (i) functional properties such as electrical and thermal conductivity; and (ii) intricate shapes that are not viable by conventional methods. First requirement can be attained by adding carbon nanomaterials into PA while the second feature is obtained by using AM. GnPs offer strong and highly conductive carbon nanomaterials, yet they can be produced through a scalable production process. Selective laser sintering (SLS) is a rapidly evolving AM process for polymer nanocomposites; it is a shear-free and flowing-free process which is entirely automated and does not need fixtures or supports [9,16,17]. Hypothetically, any thermoplastic polymer in a powder form can be processed by SLS. However, polyamide is the most widely used polymer in SLS. In general, carbon nanomaterials are mixed with PA powder past to SLS process. Mixing process and adhesion strength between carbon filler and PA powder are two critical factors to receive a strong and functional SLS-printed part. In some studies, authors used nanofiller and PA powder as received without any preprocessing [18,19]. In these studies, the interface between the phases is just physical attachment, hence, the bond between filler and matrix is weak and consequently provides low mechanical strength. In other studies [20,21], the adhesion strength and dispersion quality were promoted using chemical modification for filler surface and/or polymeric molecules before the 3D printing process. Despite of those attempts, there is still room for investigation to study other approaches which can be attractive to industry. Besides the experimental investigation, finite element modeling is an efficient tool to understand mechanical behavior of parts produced by AM processes. While developing a numerical model for a certain material, its parameters are defined. Thereby this model can accurately predict the behavior of produced parts, and hence optimizing the AM process.Material selection, process parameters, preparation and measurements are explained in detail in the Supporting Information (SI). Fig. 1 presents a schematic on the synthesis of GnP and SLS process.Fig. 2 represents the morphological characterization of the synthesized GnPs; this includes TEM, AFM and XPS measurements. Fig. 2a shows a micrograph of GnPs resting on a lacey carbon support; it evidently illustrates the plate-like structure of GnPs; the flake that has bright color with no dark color regions suggesting few-nanometer thickness. The most transparent and featureless region (red circle) likely possesses monolayer graphene. Fig. 2b displays the electron diffraction (ED) pattern of a randomly selected region in Fig. 2a. The ED pattern shows a turbostratic stacking with a random orientation between the layers; this was observed in previous reports [30]. The ED pattern in Fig. 2b shows a typical six-fold symmetry expected for GnPs with highly crystalline structure. This would benefit the functional properties of PA composite such as electrical conductivity.Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) was employed to investigate the effect of graphene platelets (GnPs) on the thermal stability of SLS-printed polyamide (PA) nanocomposite. It is known that Tonset and Tmax are defined as the temperature of 5 wt% mass loss and the temperature at the maximum rate of mass loss, respectively. Fig. 9 and Table S1 (Supporting Information) record the TGA and derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) behavior of 3D printed neat PA and PA/GnP nanocomposites. It is evident that PA/GnP nanocomposites exhibit a similar thermal degradation behavior of a single-phase degradation process which is mainly stemmed from the degradation of macromolecular chains during combustion. With the addition of GnPs, Tonset and Tmax of PA/GnP nanocomposites increased indicating high thermal stability; at 1 wt% GnPs, Tonset and Tmax increased by 7.2 °C and 21.1 °C, respectively. Meanwhile, the char residue of PA/GnP nanocomposites is increased from 0.7% to 2.1% at 1 wt% GnPs. This is due to that GnPs mixed with the viscous melt of PA in the char residue acts as a physical shield to inhibit the transmission of combustible gas from the atmosphere to PA; thus, the char restrains the release of flammable gases generated during the combustion process. This restores more material without combustion.The selective laser sintering (SLS) window is defined as the temperature range between the initial melting temperature (Tim) and the initial crystallization temperature (Tic). Fig. 10 (a&b) shows the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves of neat PA and PA/GnP nanocomposites. The Tim of PA/GnP nanocomposites slightly increased with the increase of GnP content as shown in Fig. 10a. This is primarily due to the relatively strong interaction between GnPs and PA matrix, which restricts the movement of PA molecular chains leading to high Tim. Additionally, neat PA and PA/GnP composites demonstrate similar melting peaks during the heating process. However, Tic of PA/GnP nanocomposites is much higher than that of neat PA; this is evident with the increase of peak width upon adding more GnP content. This is because GnPs act as a nucleating agent to promote the crystallization of the polymer during sintering. Table S2 (Supporting Information) lists the sintering window of neat PA and PA/GnP powders. When compared with neat PA, the SLS sintering window of the PA/GnP nanocomposites are slightly narrowed. In order to avoid distortion and curling during the sintering process, the PA/GnP powder was preheated to a temperature slightly higher than that of neat PA.QM and SH thank Asbury (Asbury, NJ, USA) for providing the GIC (1721).

Particularly, the mechanisms of keyhole pores associated with the keyhole fluctuation are not fully understood. To reveal the mechanisms of the keyhole pores formation, we adopt a multiphysics thermal-fluid flow model incorporating heat transfer, liquid flow, metal evaporation, Marangoni effect, and Darcy’s law to simulate the keyhole pore formation process, and the results are validated with the in situ X-ray images. The simulation results present the instant bubble formation due to the keyhole instability and motion of the instant bubble pinning on the solidification front. Furthermore, comparing the keyhole pore formation under different laser scanning speeds shows that the keyhole pore is sensitive to the manufacturing parameters. Additionally, the simulation under a low ambient pressure shows the feasibility of improving the keyhole stability to reduce and even avoid the formation of keyhole pores. © 2022, The Author(s).","","3D printers; Additives; Flow of fluids; Heat transfer; Metals; Fluid-flow models; Formation process; Heat transfer liquids; Liquid flow; Marangoni effects; Metal evaporation; Multi-physics; Pore formation; Thermal fluids; X-ray image; Pore size","","","","","Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR; Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, IMRE, (A20E5c0091); Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, IMRE","This research is supported by A*STAR under its AME IRG Grant (Project No. A20E5c0091).","Yang L., Harrysson O., West H., Cormier D., Compressive properties of Ti–6Al–4V auxetic mesh structures made by electron beam melting, Acta Mater., 60, (2012); Yan W., Et al., Multi-scale modeling of electron beam melting of functionally graded materials, Acta Mater., 115, pp. 403-412, (2016); Wei H., Et al., Mechanistic models for additive manufacturing of metallic components, Prog.

Methods: The specimens were additively manufactured using digital light processing (DLP). Specimen surfaces were coated with the same printed resin, and mechanical polishing was used for comparison. Surface topography, arithmetical mean height (Sa), and water contact angle values were measured. Furthermore, flexural strength (FS)/modulus and fractography were evaluated. Also, cytotoxicity was evaluated by an extract test. Finally, an adhesion test was used to investigate the adhesion of mixed oral bacteria to the specimens. Results: The Sa values in the polished (0.26 ± 0.08 µm) and coated (0.38 ± 0.14 µm) groups were significantly lower than in the untreated (2.21 ± 0.42 µm) and control (2.01 ± 0.37 µm) groups. The coating treatment resulted in a higher FS compared to the untreated surface (p = 0.0002). After the coating treatment, no significant differences were found in relative cell viability between the groups (p > 0.05). The quantitative results showed significantly higher bacterial adhesion in the untreated group than in the polished (p = 0.0047) and coated (p < 0.0001) groups. Significance: The surface characteristics and flexural properties were optimized by the protective coating. Also, the protective coating did not adversely affect cytocompatibility. Moreover, the coating treatment could effectively decrease oral bacteria adhering to the surfaces. Therefore, the protective coating treatment can be a less time-consuming alternative to mechanical polishing as a post-processing procedure for the digital denture. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Additive manufacturing; Cytotoxicity; Digital denture; Flexural strength; Microbial adhesion; Surface characteristics; Vat photopolymerization","Bacterial Adhesion; Denture Bases; Flexural Strength; Polymers; Water; Additives; Adhesion; Bacteria; Bending strength; Cell adhesion; Contact angle; Cytotoxicity; Photopolymerization; Polishing; Protective coatings; Topography; polymer; water; Base polymers; Coating treatment; Denture base; Digital denture; Digital light processing; Flexural properties; Microbial adhesion; Photo polymerization; Surface characteristics; Vat photopolymerization; bacterium adherence; denture base; 3D printers","","water, 7732-18-5; Polymers, ; Water, ","","","Österreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft, FFG, (884136); Österreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft, FFG; Southern Medical University, SMU, (PY2021003, PY2021011); Southern Medical University, SMU; Bundesministerium für Digitalisierung und Wirtschaftsstandort, BMDW; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2021B1515120059); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","The authors acknowledge the financial support given by the Science Research Cultivation Program of Stomatological Hospital, Southern Medical University ( PY2021011 and PY2021003 , respectively).

Both resin-based and powder-based processes have unique advantages ranging from strength and variety of materials for powder processes, to resolution and surface finish for resin printing. Previously, we proposed a novel powder-based printing process that directs a laser beam upwards to fuse powders through glass to a substrate. However, this setup can also be used to solidify resin as a secondary material in the same print. We demonstrate this hybrid process by fabricating samples containing both resins and powders. We also examine the potential for resin to be used to reduce powder bed fusion part porosity as well as adjust part surface finish. We discuss the impacts of these results and propose future uses. © 2022 The Authors","Multi-material; Powder; Resin; Selective laser sintering; SLA; SLS; Stereolithography","","","","","","","","Busachi A., Erkoyuncu J., Colegrove P., Martina F., Watts C., Drake R., A review of additive manufacturing technology and cost estimation techniques for the defence sector, CIRP J.

It was generally believed that brittle martensitic was detrimental to the toughness of titanium alloys. In order to obtain WAAMed titanium alloy with excellent combination of strength and toughness, Ti5111 alloy, which is a newly developed deformation twinning induced plasticity(TWIP) alloy with an excellent combination of impact toughness and strength, was prepared by arc additive manufacturing(WAAM) technology and then annealed at 900 °C + air cooling(AC) and 950 °C+ air cooling. Microstructure, tensile properties and impact toughness of WAAMed Ti5111 alloy were investigated. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) observation was adopted to identify the deformation twins activated in impact samples. Results showed that as-built WAAMed Ti5111 with excellent toughness was obtained, which was 42.8% higher than that of WAAMed Ti–6Al–4V alloy. After annealing, more deformation twins and secondary twins were activated during impact loading, which could effectively improve the toughness of WAAMed Ti5111. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Annealing; Charpy impact toughness; Deformation twin; Microstructure; Titanium alloy; Wire arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Annealing; Deformation; Fracture toughness; Plasticity; Titanium alloys; Wire; Air cooling; Annealing; Charpy impact toughness; Deformation twin; Martensitics; Strength and toughness; Titanium (alloys); Wire arc; Wire arc additive manufacturing; Wrought alloys; Microstructure","","","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFB1105803); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Project of the P.

However, due to the process variabilities which can exist between 3DP systems, manufacturer workflows, and digital conversions, there may be variabilities among 3DP parts or between design files and final manufactured products. The overall goal of this project is to determine the dimensional variability of commercially obtained 3DP titanium lattice-containing test coupons and compare it to the original design files. Methods: This manuscript outlines the procedure used to measure dimensional variability of 3D Printed lattice coupons and analyze the differences in external dimensions and pore area when using laser and electron beam fabricated samples. The key dimensions measured were the bulk length, width, and depth using calipers. Strut thickness and pore area were assessed for the lattice components using optical imaging and µCT. Results: Results show a difference in dimensional measurement between printed parts and the computer-designed files for all groups analyzed including the internal lattice dimensions. Measurements of laser manufactured coupons varied from the nominal by less than 0.2 mm and results show averages greater than the nominal value for length, width, and depth dimensions. Measurements of Electron Beam Melting coupons varied between 0.4 mm-0.7 mm from the nominal value and showed average lengths below the nominal dimension while the width and depths were greater than the nominal values. The length dimensions of Laser Powder Bed Fusion samples appeared to be impacted by hot isostatic press more than the width and depth dimension. When lattice relative density was varied, there appeared to be little impact on the external dimensional variability for the as-printed state. Conclusions: Based on these results, we can conclude that there are relevant variations between designed files and printed parts. However, we cannot currently state if these results are clinically relevant and further testing needs to be conducted to apply these results to real-world situations. © 2022, The Author(s).","Accuracy; Lattice; Powder bed fusion; Titanium","Additives; Electron beams; Optical lattices; Product design; titanium; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Accuracy; Design files; Lattice; Nominal values; Pore areas; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion; Titania; Article; electron beam melting; fluorescence imaging; human; length; micro-computed tomography; relative density; thickness; three dimensional printing; volume; 3D printers","","titanium, 7440-32-6","","","","","Di Prima M., Coburn J., Hwang D., Kelly J., Khairuzzaman A., Ricles L., Additively manufactured medical products–the FDA perspective, 3D print me, 2, 1, pp. 1-6, (2016); Technical Considerations for Additive Manufactured Medical Devices; Ricles L.M., Coburn J.C., Di Prima M., Oh S.S., Regulating 3D-printed medical products, Sci transl med, 10, 461, (2018); Makes A.A.M.S.C., Standardization Roadmap for Additive Manufacturing-Version 2.0, Am Makes ANSI Addit Manuf Stand Collab, 2, pp. 1-203, (2018); Lieneke T., Adam G., Leuders S., Knoop F., Josupeit S., Delfs P., Et al., Systematical determination of tolerances for additive manufacturing by measuring linear dimensions, (2015); Lieneke T., Denzer V., Adam G.A., Zimmer D., Dimensional tolerances for additive manufacturing: Experimental investigation for Fused Deposition Modeling, Procedia CIRP, 43, pp. 286-291, (2016); Rupal B.S., Anwer N., Secanell M., Qureshi A.J., Geometric tolerance and manufacturing assemblability estimation of metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes, Mater Des, 194, (2020); Dantan J.-Y., Huang Z., Goka E., Homri L., Etienne A., Bonnet N., Et al., Geometrical variations management for additive manufactured product, CIRP Ann, 66, 1, pp. 161-164, (2017); Zuowei Z., Keimasi S., Anwer N., Mathieu L., Lihong Q., Review of shape deviation modeling for additive manufacturing, pp. 241-250, (2017); Cheng L., Tsung F., Wang A., A statistical transfer learning perspective for modeling shape deviations in additive manufacturing, IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 2, 4, pp. 1988-1993, (2017); Brajlih T., Valentan B., Balic J., Drstvensek I., Speed and accuracy evaluation of additive manufacturing machines, Rapid Prototyping J, 17, 1, pp. 64-75, (2011); Minetola P., Calignano F., Galati M., Comparing geometric tolerance capabilities of additive manufacturing systems for polymers, Addit Manuf, 32, (2020); Fotovvati B., Asadi E., Size effects on geometrical accuracy for additive manufacturing of Ti-6Al-4V ELI parts, The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 104, 5, pp. 2951-2959, (2019); Moroni G., Syam W.P., Petro S., Towards early estimation of part accuracy in additive manufacturing, Procedia CIRP, 21, pp. 300-305, (2014); Toth T., Hudak R., Zivcak J., Dimensional verification and quality control of implants produced by additive manufacturing, Quality Innovation Prosperity, 19, 1, pp. 9-21, (2015); Jin S.J., Kim D.Y., Kim J.H., Kim W.C., Accuracy of Dental Replica Models Using Photopolymer Materials in Additive Manufacturing: In Vitro Three-Dimensional Evaluation, J Prosthodont., 28, 2, pp. e557-e562, (2019); Salmi M., Paloheimo K.-S., Tuomi J., Wolff J., Makitie A., Accuracy of medical models made by additive manufacturing (rapid manufacturing), Journal of Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery, 41, 7, pp. 603-609, (2013); Navarro J., Din M., Janes M.E., Swayambunathan J., Fisher J.P., Dreher M.L., Effect of print orientation on microstructural features and mechanical properties of 3D porous structures printed with continuous digital light processing, Rapid Prototyping J, 25, 6, pp. 1017-1029, (2019); Wang M.O., Piard C.M., Melchiorri A., Dreher M.L., Fisher J.P., Evaluating changes in structure and cytotoxicity during in vitro degradation of three-dimensional printed scaffolds, Tissue Eng Part A, 21, 9-10, pp. 1642-1653, (2015); Shipley H., McDonnell D., Culleton M., Coull R., Lupoi R., O'Donnell G., Et al., Optimisation of process parameters to address fundamental challenges during selective laser melting of Ti-6Al-4V: A review, Int J Mach Tools Manuf, 128, pp. 1-20, (2018); Du Plessis A., Yelamanchi B., Fischer C., Miller J., Beamer C., Rogers K., Et al., Productivity enhancement of laser powder bed fusion using compensated shelled geometries and hot isostatic pressing, Advances in Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, 2, (2021); Bhavar V., Kattire P., Patil V., Khot S., Gujar K., Singh R., A review on powder bed fusion technology of metal additive manufacturing.

The incorporation of ceramic-based inclusions within liquid resins enhances the thermal and mechanical properties of the final 3D printed component while improving the surface finishing of the final parts; in this way, it expands the range of process applications and reduces the post-processing steps. The proposed approach investigates the bulk modification of commercial SLA resins mixed with ceramic powders of Al2O3 (grain size 1–10 μm) and SiO2 (grain size 55–75 nm) aiming to improve 3D printed parts performance in terms of mechanical properties, dimensional stability and surface finishing compared with pure, unmodified resins. The produced materials were used for the development of inserts for injection moulding and were examined for their performance during the injection moulding process. The addition of particles in the nano- and micro-range is being employed to improve parts performance for rapid tooling applications whilst maintaining 3D printing accuracy, thermal and mechanical properties as well as achieving a smooth surface finishing compared with unmodified resins. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing; ceramic powders; ceramic resins; injection moulding; materials for additive manufacturing; photocurable resins; resin formulations; stereolithography","","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (101016262)","This research was funded by European research project imPURE, grant number 101016262.","He R., Liu W., Wu Z., An D., Huang M., Wu H., Jiang Q., Ji X., Wu S., Xie Z., Fabrication of complex-shaped zirconia ceramic parts via a DLP- stereolithography-based 3D printing method, Ceram.

The results indicated that the selective laser melting (SLM) W exhibited a finer grain sizes, a lower strength ductility, hardness and thermal conductivity compared to hot-rolled W. The main reason for this result was that the laser underwent rapid heating and cooling when it was used to melt W powder with high energy density, resulting in large internal stress in the sample after manufacturing. Subsequently, the internal stress was released, leading to the generation of micro-cracks at the grain boundaries, thereby affecting the performance of SLM W samples. In addition, the higher fraction of high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) of SLM W was found to be the key factor for intrinsic brittleness. Because the HAGBs are the preferred crack paths, which could promote crack propagation and decrease fracture energy. © 2022, The Author(s).","Hot rolling; Mechanical property; Microstructure; Selective laser melting (SLM); Thermal conductivity; Tungsten (W)","Cracks; Fracture mechanics; Grain boundaries; Hot rolling; Melting; Microstructure; Selective laser melting; Tungsten; Comparatives studies; High angle grain boundaries; Manufacturing methods; Mechanical behavior; Pure tungsten; Selective laser melting; Thermal and mechanical properties; Thermal behaviours; Tungsten (W); Thermal conductivity","","","","","Die & Mold Technology; Sixth China Association of Science and Technology Youth Talents Invitation Project; Wuhan Second Ship Design and Research Institute, (YT19201903); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (U1808216); Huazhong University of Science and Technology, HUST; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province, (2020CFB667); China University of Geosciences, CUG; Key Research and Development Program of Hunan Province of China, (2020BAB045)","Funding text 1: Chong Wang, born in 1995, is a master candidate at State Key Laboratory of Material Processing and Die & Mold Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China.

In this study, we used the FFF to 3D print a high-performance polymer known as Poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK) for a load-bearing application. Specifically, we 3D printed resilient PEEK interbody fusion cages, a critical implant in spinal fusion surgeries. However, the FFF of PEEK structures is challenging because PEEK requires high melting temperatures and is prone to warping and incomplete crystallization, negatively affecting the fusion cages' strength. Hence, for the first time, in this study, we vary critical FFF processing parameters such as nozzle, chamber, and bedplate temperature and analyze their influence on the cages' mechanical and thermal properties. Our results indicate that increasing thermal parameters helps better layer fusion and adhesion and augments the cages' crystallinity, thus enhancing their mechanical properties. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Fusion cages; Mechanical properties; PEEK; Thermal properties","3D printers; Crystallinity; Ethers; Fabrication; Ketones; Polyether ether ketones; 3-D printing; 3d prints; 3D-printing; Fusion cages; Manufacturing tools; Medical implants; Patient specific; Poly ether ether ketones; Poly(ether ether ketones); Spinal fusion; Thermodynamic properties","","","","","NSF I-Corps, (2118528)","This work is supported by NSF I-Corps grant no 2118528 and Dr. Sikder's Startup grant.

AM technologies can be used to manufacture injection mould inserts. Several polymeric additive technologies like Material Jetting (including PolyJet), Material Extrusion (including Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)) and Powder Bed Fusion (including Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)) can make mould inserts that are suitable for small series production. Metal inserts, made of steel or bronze can also be produced by Powder Bed Fusion (for example by Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS)). These are comparable to their traditional, machined counterparts, regarding longevity and dimensional accuracy. In our study, we made inserts by Material Jetting (PolyJet) from an epoxy acrylate resin and compared its in-mould behaviour to a reference mould insert machined from aluminium. We measured the operational strains, cavity pressure and temperature distribution of the inserts. Operational strains exceeded 2 % in the case of the epoxy-acrylate insert. However, strains of the aluminium insert remained below 0.03 % for the aluminium insert under the same operational conditions. We set up correlational diagrams to numerically specify the load-deformation curve of the mould inserts. We also applied 3D scanning to measure the deformation of the inserts and injection moulded products alike. We found that scanning the injection moulded products yields more information about operational deformation of the inserts than scanning the inserts themselves. © 2022 The Authors","3D printing; Injection moulding; Material Jetting; PolyJet technology; Rapid prototyping; Rapid tooling","Additives; Aluminum; Deformation; Epoxy resins; Injection molding; Laser heating; Molds; Powder metals; Scanning; Sintering; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Additive manufacturing technology; Injection molded products; Material jetting; Mold inserts; Polyjet technology; Powder bed; Rapid tooling; Rapid-prototyping; 3D printers","","","","","Ministry for Culture and Innovation; NRDI; TKP2020 NC; Nemzeti Kutatási Fejlesztési és Innovációs Hivatal, NKFIH, (2018-1.3.1-VKE-2018-00001, FK138501, OTKA FK134336, ÚNKP-22-3-II-BME-105); Nemzeti Kutatási, Fejlesztési és Innovaciós Alap, NKFIA; Innovációs és Technológiai Minisztérium","This work was supported by the National Research, Development and Innovation Office, Hungary ( 2018-1.3.1-VKE-2018-00001 , OTKA FK138501 , OTKA FK134336 ) and by the ÚNKP-22-3-II-BME-105 New National Excellence Program of the Ministry for Culture and Innovation from the source of the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund .

Explicit investigation of the energy efficiency for laser melting requires the direct characterization of melt pool dimension and vapor depression, which is very difficult due to the opaque nature of the molten metal. Here we report the direct observation and quantification of effects of the TiC nanoparticles on the vapor depression and melt pool formation during laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) of Al6061 by in-situ high-speed high-energy x-ray imaging. Based on the quantification results, we calculated the laser melting energy efficiency (defined here as the ratio of the energy needed to melt the material to the energy delivered by the laser beam) with and without TiC nanoparticles during LPBF of Al6061. The results show that adding TiC nanoparticles into Al6061 leads to a significant increase of laser melting energy efficiency (114% increase on average, 521% increase under 312 W laser power, 0.4 m/s scan speed). Systematic property measurement, simulation, and x-ray imaging studies enable us, for the first time, to identify that three mechanisms work together to enhance the laser melting energy efficiency: (1) adding TiC nanoparticles increases the absorptivity; (2) adding TiC nanoparticles decreases the thermal conductivity, and (3) adding TiC nanoparticles enables the initiation of vapor depression and multiple reflection at lower laser power (i.e., lowers the laser power threshold for keyholing). The method and mechanisms of using TiC nanoparticles to increase the laser melting energy efficiency during LPBF of Al6061 we reported here may guide the development of feedstock materials for more energy efficient laser metal AM. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Energy efficiency; Keyhole; Laser powder bed fusion; Melt pool; Metal matrix nanocomposites; X-ray imaging","Additives; Aluminum compounds; Energy efficiency; Lakes; Laser beams; Melting; Metal nanoparticles; Metallic matrix composites; Nanocomposites; Powder metals; Selective laser melting; Titanium carbide; Keyhole; Laser melting; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Melt pool; Melting energy; Metal matrix nanocomposites; Powder bed; TiC nanoparticles; X-ray imaging; Metals","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; Argonne National Laboratory, ANL, (DE-AC02-06CH11357); Argonne National Laboratory, ANL; University of Wisconsin-Madison, UW","This work is supported by US National Science Foundation and University of Wisconsin-Madison Startup Fund .

Taguchi multi-parameter optimization was used to optimize the input parameters (reagent volume, temperature, concentration, and time) in the vapour smoothening process. With the ideal input parameters, the roughness of the FDM printed parts was reduced by over 95%. The effectiveness of a vapour smoothening system is better when the system temperature is maintained at the boiling point of the reagent, the reagent is of its highest concentration, and when the specimens placed are placed directly over the ultrasonic mist-maker. The system discussed works best with FDM printed parts having minimum porosity and better quality. The hot chemical vapour smoothing approach reduced specimen flexural strength and increased top layer wear. The findings of this study will help develop a large-scale polishing system for FDM printed thermoplastics and enhance the use of FDM components in sectors that need highly polished parts. © 2022 Published by Faculty of Engineering.","Acyrlonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS);

However, additively produced surfaces do not meet the requirements for functional surfaces, which is why subsequent machining is mandatory for most of AM-workpieces. Further, the performance of many functional surfaces can be enhanced by microstructuring. The combination of both AM and subtractive processes is referred to as hybrid manufacturing. In this paper, the hybrid manufacturing of AISI 316L is investigated. The two AM technologies laser-based powder bed fusion (L-PBF) and high-speed laser directed energy deposition (HS L-DED) are used to produce workpieces which are subsequently machined by micro milling (tool diameter d = 100 µm). The machining results were evaluated based on tool wear, burr formation, process forces and the generated topography. Those indicated differences in the machinability of materials produced by L-PBF and HS L-DED which were attributed to different microstructural properties. © 2022, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; High-speed laser directed energy deposition; Hybrid manufacturing; Laser-based powder bed fusion; Micro milling","3D printers; Additives; Cutting tools; Deposition; Milling machines; Topography; 316L; Directed energy; Energy depositions; High speed laser; High-speed laser directed energy deposition; Hybrid manufacturing; Laser-based; Laser-based powder bed fusion; Micro milling; Powder bed; Milling (machining)","","","","","Ministry of Economics, Transport, Agriculture and Viticulture of the State of Rhineland-Palatinate; Technische Universität Kaiserslautern, TU KL; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

The NARXs predict extrusion rate of the extrudate and compression force acting on the filament with an average discrepancy of 0.12 % with respect to the original simulation, but at a fraction of the computational time (0.1 s of the NARX vs. 600 s needed by the original simulation to process the same one-minute time interval). In addition to illustrating how NARXs can be created to mimic an existing simulation, in this work we show how the NARXs can be physically connected to the sensors of a real FFF machine, thus creating an effective digital twin of the extrusion process, useful to support real-time decision making by an AI machine controller. Finally, we show how the implemented digital twin can be used for in-process monitoring, bringing as example the automated detection of an extrusion clogging event. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Additive manufacturing; Digital twin; Fused filament fabrication; In-process monitoring; Machine learning; Simulation of the extrusion process","3D printers; Decision making; E-learning; Extrusion; Process control; Process monitoring; Recurrent neural networks; Dynamic recurrent neural networks; Exogenous variables; Extrusion simulation; Fused filament fabrication; In-process monitoring; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Nonlinear autoregressive model; Simulation of the extrusion process; Fabrication","","","","","Farrell Family Foundation, FFF","This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

The fatigue samples were 3D printed in ABS and PLA using a fused filament fabrication printer. Various weld joints, including ABS/ABS, PLA/PLA, and PLA/ABS, were produced utilizing the rotary friction welding process. The fatigue behavior of these joints was evaluated using rotating-beam fatigue testing at various load levels. In addition, fatigue tests were performed on non-welded PLA and ABS samples. The findings revealed that PLA/PLA joints had superior fatigue resistance than non-welded PLA. Furthermore, in this sequence, PLA/PLA, ABS/ABS, and PLA/ABS had the highest fatigue resistance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing;

Meanwhile, selective laser melting (SLM) technology that fabricated metallic material using layer-by-layer melting strategy can meet this demand. However, SLM fabrication technology has not yet been applied in conjunction with FCNAT-HEA systems, and the optimal SLM processing parameters and the microstructural characteristics of the resulting components remain unknown. The present study addresses this issue by fabricating highly dense (>99.9 %) cubic (FeCoNi)85.84Al7.09Ti7.07 FCNAT-HEA samples. The results demonstrate that the as-fabricated FCNAT-HEA samples possess highly non-equilibrium microstructures that form under the rapid heating and cooling cycles of the SLM process, and include typical overlapping between semi-elliptical melt pools, widely varying grain morphologies with coarse columnar grains and typical equiaxed grains with 〈0 0 1〉 growth orientation, dislocation network structures with elemental Ti and Al segregation, high-density L21-phase precipitates with sizes on the order of 200–300 nm, and near-spherical nano-sized Al-oxide particles. This research confirms the feasibility of fabricating FCNAT-HEA components by SLM, and therefore provides guidance for fabricating such HEA components with complex geometries. © 2022 The Author(s)","Cellular structure; Dislocation network structure; High-entropy alloy; Process parameter optimization; Selective laser melting","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Complex networks; Entropy; Fabrication; High strength alloys; High-entropy alloys; Melting; Textures; Titanium alloys; Alloy components; Cellular structure; Complex geometries; Dislocation network structure; Dislocation networks; High entropy alloys; Laser melting process; Network structures; Process parameters optimizations; Selective laser melting; Selective laser melting","","","","","Space Utilization System of China Manned Space Engineering, (KJZ-YY-NCL08); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51925103, 51971123); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Shanghai Municipal Education Commission, (2020-JCIQ-ZD-186-01, 2021-01-07-00-09-E00114); Shanghai Municipal Education Commission; Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project, (D16002); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project; open research fund of Songshan Lake Materials Laboratory, (2021SLABFN06)","The authors would like to acknowledge the open research fund of Songshan Lake Materials Laboratory (2021SLABFN06), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51971123, 51925103), the Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission (2021-01-07-00-09-E00114), the financial support from Program 173 (2020-JCIQ-ZD-186-01), 111 project (D16002) and the Space Utilization System of China Manned Space Engineering (KJZ-YY-NCL08).","Fu Z.Q., Jiang L., Wardini J.L., MacDonald B.E., Wen H.M., Xiong W., Zhang D.L., Zhou Y.Z., Rupert T.J., Chen W.P., Lavernia E.J., A high-entropy alloy with hierarchical nanoprecipitates and ultrahigh strength, Sci.

Microstructural characterization, thermal desorption analyses, and slow-strain-rate tests were conducted to study the hydrogen trapping behavior and the effects of hydrogen on the deformation and fracture mechanism. The results showed that cell walls with high-density dislocations and Mn segregation provided hydrogen trapping and increased the high hydrogen capacity. This caused hydrogen embrittlement, accompanied by hydrogen-assisted intergranular cracking in as-built CoCrFeMnNi HEA. A heat treatment at 900 ℃ reduced dislocation density of the walls and eliminated the Mn segregation. Interestingly, hydrogen-induced ductilization was enabled in the heat-treated-SLM HEA. This is attributed to an appropriate twinability and twinning strain which greatly suppressed intergranular cracking in the surface layer. Therefore, tuning twinability through the control of microstructure is critical for a transition from hydrogen embrittlement to ductilization for SLM-built HEA. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Cell wall; High-entropy alloy; Hydrogen embrittlement; Hydrogen-induced ductilization; Selective laser melting; Thermal desorption analysis","Additives; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Cracks; Entropy; Grain boundaries; Heat treatment; Hydrogen; Hydrogen embrittlement; Iron alloys; Manganese alloys; Melting; Selective laser melting; Strain rate; Textures; Walls (structural partitions); Cell walls; High entropy alloys; Hydrogen trapping; Hydrogen-induced ductilization; Intergranular cracking; Mechanical response; Micro-structural; Mn segregations; Selective laser melting; Thermal desorption analysis; High-entropy alloys","","","","","Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE; University of Sydney, Usyd; Ministry of Education, MOE; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (MOST-109–2224-E-002–002, NSTC-111-2634-F-007-008, NSTC-111–2224-E-007–003, NSTC-111–3116-F-002–005); Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST; National Science and Technology Council, NSTC","Y.T.L. and H.W.Y. appreciate National Science and Technology Council ( NSTC ), named Ministry of Science and Technology previously, in Taiwan for providing financial support under Grant Nos.

However, the 3DP technological progressions in the biomedical sector have majorly taken place in the last decade after the evolution of novel 3DP systems, generally categorised as bioprinters and biomaterials to provide a replacement, transplantation or regeneration of the damaged organs and tissue constructs of the human body. There is now substantial scientific literature accessible to support the benefits of digital healthcare procedures with the help of bioprinters. It is of the highest significance to know the fundamental principles of the available printers and the compatibility of biomaterials as their feedstock, notwithstanding the huge potential of bioprinting systems to manufacture organs and other human body components. This paper provides a precise and helpful reading of the different categories of bioprinters, suitable biomaterials, numerical simulations and modelling and examples of much acknowledged clinical practices. The paper will also cite the prominent issues that still have not received desired solutions. Overall, the article will be of great use for all the professionals, scholars and engineers concerned with the 3DP, bioprinting and biomaterials. © IMechE 2022.","3D printing; bioactivity; biomaterials;

They are traditionally produced by soft lithography: starting from a mold fabricated by optical photolithography, a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) device is obtained by casting and baking. While this technique offers the possibility to produce features with high resolution, it is not flexible enough to respond to the necessity of customization and prototyping. In this study, we propose as alternative the production of devices by digital light processing (DLP), a vat photopolymerization technology, in combination with a commercially available, biocompatible resin. Studying the process factors by a statistical methodology called Design of Experiment (DoE), we were able to achieve small features with high aspect ratio (60). DoE method allowed us to have a deep understanding of the process without the need of any physical inspection of the involved phenomena, and to generate empirical models, correlating the process factors to the dimensions of the final printed object. We proved that this optimization was beneficial also in terms of transparency (evaluated by UV-Vis spectrophotometry), and mechanical strength (evaluated by a compression test) of the printed resin. Finally, a proof-of-concept microfluidic device was fabricated, sealed to a PDMS membrane through an oxygen plasma treatment, and tested against leakage on a microfluidic circuit for one week. As result, we proved that DLP printing is not only a suitable method to develop microfluidic devices, but if correctly optimized it can also reproduce small features in the order of tens of micrometers rapidly. © 2022 The Authors","3D printing; Design of experiment; Digital light processing; Lab on Chips; Organ on Chips; Response surface method; Statistical optimization","Aspect ratio; Biocompatibility; Compression testing; Design of experiments; Fluidic devices; Lab-on-a-chip; Medical applications; Microchannels; Microfluidics; Plasma applications; Polydimethylsiloxane; Resins; Silicones; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Digital light processing; Lab-on-chips; Microfluidics devices; On chips; Organ on chip; Photo polymerization; Response surfaces methods; Statistical optimization; 3D printers","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Horizon 2020, (953121)","Funding text 1: The authors are grateful to the “Tecnopolo per la medicina di precisione” (TecnoMED Puglia) - Regione Puglia: DGR n. 2117 del 21/11/2018, CUP: B84I18000540002 and “Tecnopolo di Nanotecnologia e Fotonica per la medicina di precisione” (TecnoMED) - FISR/MIUR-CNR: delibera CIPE n.3449 del 7-08-2017, CUP: B83B17000010001.

The as-printed materials were subjected to annealing at a temperature of 1000 °C for 2 h. Microstructural observations revealed that after annealing the cellular network inside the grains disappeared, and a slight increase in grain size and the proportion of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) occurred. The most significant microstructural changes occurred with the nano-inclusions, as the annealing resulted in change in their chemical composition, a decrease in their density (number per unit volume), while simultaneously their size increased. All these changes caused a decline in the mechanical properties of the steel and an increase in its susceptibility to localized corrosion. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","316L stainless Steel; Corrosion resistance; Laser powder bed fusion; Mechanical properties","Annealing; Austenitic stainless steel; Corrosive effects; Grain boundaries; Localized corrosion; Steel corrosion; 316 L stainless steel; Cellular network; Effect of annealing; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Mechanical; Mechanical and corrosion properties; Micro-structural observations; Powder bed; Printed materials; Corrosion resistance","","","","","Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering; Warsaw University of Technology, Poland","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from the statutory funds of the Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering, Warsaw University of Technology, Poland .","Zhang B., Li Y., Bai Q., Defect formation mechanisms in selective laser melting: a review, Chinese J.

Several studies have investigated the process parameters that affect surface quality. However, most researchers have ignored the importance of the scanning strategy. In this study, the Taguchi method was used to investigate the relation between warpage and fundamental parameters (laser power, scanning speed, overlap, and scanning angle) to fabricate stable and undistorted specimens. Moreover, several scanning strategies (offset scanning, line scanning, meander scanning, meander scanning with hatch vector, and lightning scanning) were applied to explore the influences on surface quality. The results revealed that meander scanning and lightning scanning generated consistent specimens without large deformation. The process parameters, such as an increased 45° scanning direction and 30% overlap, optimized the surface quality. A lower scanning speed (500 mm/s) could generate lower Ra of specimens, with the exception of lightning scanning with an increased 45° scanning direction. This study may contribute to the growing understanding of the scanning strategy in SLM. © IMechE 2020.","scanning strategy; Selective laser melting; surface roughness; Taguchi method","Lightning; Melting;

Classical approaches based on locally refined finite elements combined with time-stepping schemes can only address the spatial multi-scale nature and provide only limited scaling potential for massively parallel computations. We address these shortcomings in a space-time Galerkin framework where the finite element interpolation also includes the temporal dimension. In this setting, we construct four-dimensional meshes that are locally refined towards the laser spot and allow for varying temporal accuracy depending on the position in space. By splitting the mesh into conforming time-slabs, we recover a stepwise solution to solve the space-time problem locally in time at this slab; additionally, we can choose time-slab sizes significantly larger than classical time-stepping schemes. As a result, we believe this setting to be well suited for large-scale parallelization. In our work, we use a continuous Galerkin–Petrov formulation of the nonlinear heat equation with an apparent heat capacity model to account for the phase change. We validate our approach by computing the AMB2018-02 benchmark, where we obtain an excellent agreement with the measured melt pool shape. Using the same setup, we demonstrate the performance potential of our approach by hatching a square area with a laser path length of about one meter. © 2022, The Author(s).","Laser powder bed fusion; Local hp-refinement; Metal additive manufacturing; Parallel in time; Space-time finite elements","Additives; Finite element method; Galerkin methods; Nonlinear equations; Powder metals; Specific heat; Hp-refinement; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Local hp-refinement; Metal additive manufacturing; Metal additives; Parallel in time; Powder bed; Space time finite element; Spacetime; 3D printers","","","","","Curtin Corrosion Centre; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (777778); Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (KO 4570/2-1)","Funding text 1: We gratefully acknowledge the support of Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through the grant KO 4570/2-1.

However, the poor process reproducibility and unstable product reliability has hindered its wide adoption in practice. Hence, there is a pressing demand for in-situ quality monitoring and real-time process control. In this paper, a feature-level multi-sensor fusion approach is proposed to combine acoustic emission signals with photodiode signals to realize in-situ quality monitoring for intelligence-driven production of SLM. An off-axial in-situ monitoring system featuring a microphone and a photodiode is developed to capture the process signatures during the building process. According to the 2D porosity and 3D density measurements, the collected acoustic and optical signals are grouped into three categories to indicate the quality of the produced parts. In consideration of the laser scanning information, an approach to transform the 1D signal to 2D image is developed. The converted images are then used to train a convolutional neural network so as to extract and fuse the features derived from the two individual sensors. In comparison with several baseline models, the proposed multi-sensor fusion approach achieves the best performance in quality monitoring. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Additive manufacturing; AI-driven production control; In-situ quality monitoring; Multi-sensor fusion; Product quality; Selective laser melting","Acoustic emission testing; Additives; Photodiodes; Process control; Process monitoring; Selective laser melting; AI-driven production control; Complex geometries; Feature level; Geometry precision; In-situ quality monitoring; Metal components; Multi-sensor fusion; Products quality; Quality monitoring; Selective laser melting; Production control","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52105254, 52105446, 52175231)","The first author (J.C., Li) and third author (Q., Zhou) acknowledge the support by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant Nos. 52175231 , 52105254 , and 52105446 .

This study aimed to minimize this inhomogeneity in equiatomic CoCrFeMnNi high entropy alloy (HEA) produced by selective laser melting (SLM) from a mixture of elemental powder. A detailed study was undertaken regarding the effects of remelting scan strategy on microstructural and mechanical properties, melt pool geometry, and elemental distribution of CoCrFeMnNi HEA manufactured using the SLM process. The SLM sample with remelting scan strategy showed a homogeneous elemental distribution. The remelted SLM sample showed a homogeneous hardness distribution. The X-ray diffraction of the as-built and remelted SLM showed a single-phase FCC structure, typical for a HEA. Prediction and observation of melt pool depth exhibited a lower depth in the remelted SLM samples. The microstructure of the melt pools of both as-built and remelted SLM showed a fine grain morphology, typical of rapid solidification. The boundary of melt pools in the as-built SLM and the inter-space of melt pools in the remelted SLM consisted of both coarse and equiaxed/columnar dendritic grains. The present results confirmed the possibility of fabricating a homogenized CoCrFeMnNi HEA from mixed elemental powders using SLM with remelting scan strategy. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","CoCrFeMnNi; High entropy alloy; In-situ alloying; Laser remelting; Melt pool; Selective laser melting","Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Entropy; High-entropy alloys; Iron alloys; Lakes; Laser heating; Manganese alloys; Morphology; Rapid solidification; Remelting; Selective laser melting; Textures; Additive layer manufacturing; Alloy effect; Elemental distribution; Elemental powders; High entropy alloys; In-situ alloying; Laser re-melting; Melt pool; Multi-component alloying; Selective laser melting; Alloying","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2020A1515011242, G2021163004L); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; International Science and Technology Cooperation Programme, ISTCP, (2021A0505050002); International Science and Technology Cooperation Programme, ISTCP","The authors would like to thank Mrs. Laivi Valjaots, Messrs.

The microstructure of L-PBFed Ti-41Nb alloy consists of columnar grains of a high aspect ratio with a strong< 001 > preferred orientation along the building direction (BD). To evaluate the mechanical anisotropy of L-PBFed Ti-41 Nb alloy, the external loading was compressed either perpendicular or parallel to BD (i.e., horizontal and vertical samples, respectively). Compression results show that the compressive yield strength (CYS) of horizontal samples is significantly higher than that of vertical samples. At the early stage of deformation, obvious {332}< 113 > mechanical twins are preferentially detected in the nearly< 001 > orientated grains along the compression axis. The dominant reasons for the lower CYS of vertical samples can be attributed to the easier activation of {332}〈113〉 mechanical twins in the typical columnar grains with strong< 001 > crystallographic orientation. It is suggested that the anisotropy of the L-PBFed alloy can be utilized through simple position control such as adjustment of the BD and reasonable structural design. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Anisotropy; Columnar grain; Crystallographic orientation; Laser powder bed fusion; Ti-41Nb alloy","Aspect ratio; Binary alloys; Morphology; Niobium alloys; Position control; Structural design; Titanium alloys; Columnar grain; Crystallographic orientations; Grain morphologies; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Mechanical anisotropy; Mechanical twins; Nb alloys; Powder bed; Ti-41nb alloy; Anisotropy","","","","","TRUMPF; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51821001, 51831011, 51871152, 52071205); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work is supported financially by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51871152 , 51831011 , 52071205 and 51821001 ).

The effect of laser shock on the microstructure of HEAs under the same additive manufacturing parameters was discussed assisted by finite element method (FEM). Results of electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) show that grain refinement occurs in LSMMPed HEAs under optimal parameters. The strengthened plane texture is observed in the LSMMPed HEAs from three crystallographic orientations of [100], [110], and [111]. The Vickers hardness of HEAs is enhanced by grain refinement and there is no elemental segregation in the LSMMP process. The validation of LSMMP by tensile tests also indicates that the LSMMPed HEAs have better ductility. The present results demonstrate the fast real-time interference capability of LSMMP in metal additive manufacturing. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; High-entropy alloys; Laser shock; Melt pool","Additives; Chromium alloys; Entropy; Grain size and shape; High-entropy alloys; Iron alloys; Melting; Selective laser melting; Tensile testing; Textures; Vickers hardness; Columnar crystals; Crystallographic orientations; Electron back-scattered diffraction; Grains refinement; High entropy alloys; Laser shocks; Manufacturing parameters; Melt pool; Optimal parameter; Vicker hardness; Cobalt alloys","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51901162); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51901162 ).

However, the design and optimization method of the grayscale distribution remains elusive. In this paper, we propose an optimization method for grayscale DLP printed rectangular blocks based on a machine learning and evolutionary algorithm. We use an automated finite element model-based evaluation to predict the deformation shapes with arbitrary grayscale distribution, considering the nonlinear mechanical performances. A machine learning model based on recurrent neural networks is trained using the database formed by the finite element method model to enable fast and precise prediction of the deformed shapes. Optimal designs of the deformed shapes are efficiently realized via integrating the machine learning model and evolution algorithm method. Grayscale distributions are optimized to form desired deformations and validated by experiments. This work paves the way for designing and optimizing grayscale digital light processing 3D printed structures. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51905336, 52275025); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; State Key Laboratory of Mechanical System and Vibration, (MSVZD202212); State Key Laboratory of Mechanical System and Vibration","D.W. acknowledges support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 52275025 , 51905336 ) and the State Key Laboratory of Mechanical System and Vibration (Grant No. MSVZD202212 ).","Yin H., Ding Y., Zhai Y., Tan W., Yin X., Orthogonal programming of heterogeneous micro-mechano-environments and geometries in three-dimensional bio-stereolithography, Nat.

However, a major drawback of additively manufactured (AMed) metallic components is their poor and anisotropic mechanical properties, which primarily originate from the presence of metallurgical defects and coarse columnar grains. This study herein aims to (i) manipulate directed energy deposition (DED) AM parameters towards densification and (ii) suppress the formation of coarse columnar grains in DED AMed CoCrFeMnNi HEA. First, the effects of laser powers and laser scan speeds on the formation of various metallurgical defects in the DED AMed CoCrFeMnNi samples were investigated. Contrary to the laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) AMed CoCrFeMnNi HEAs which were reported to form lack-of-fusion defects in the regime of low laser powers and high laser scan speeds, the lack-of-fusion defects in DED AMed CoCrFeMnNi HEAs tend to form in the regime of high laser powers and low laser scan speeds. This abnormal observation was rationalized by recourse to the resultant large layer thickness and hence insufficient melting. Cracking was observed in the regime of high laser scan speeds, and these cracks were classified into solidification cracks based on the observation of the intruding cellular/dendritic features on the cracked surface. High angle grain boundaries were found to be more sensitive to solidification cracking and the inherent mechanisms were discussed. Through such a high throughput library of samples, a printability map and near-full density were achieved for DED AMed CoCrFeMnNi HEAs. Second, for the grain structure control, contrary to the previous works that tried to manipulate the solidification conditions or introduce the secondary heterogenous particles, the current paper employed ultrasonic-assisted DED AM processing of CoCrFeMnNi HEA. Despite the measured lowered cooling rate, the coarse columnar grains were replaced by finer equiaxed grains in the presence of ultrasound, i.e., the average grain size decreases from 140 to 44 μm. The formation of fine equiaxed grains were rationalized by the combined effects of the ultrasonic-facilitated dendrite fragmentation as heterogenous nucleation sites and the enhanced liquid supercooling in the columnar front. As a direct result, the tensile yield strength of the ultrasonic-assisted DED AMed CoCrFeMnNi HEA increases by ∼ 17%, with no obvious tensile ductility drop. The strength increase was well explained by the grain refinement effect based on the classic Hall-Petch relationship. These findings provide opportunities to additively manufacture high-performance and complex-geometry HEAs components for critical applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; CoCrFeMnNi; Densification; Directed energy deposition; Grain structure control; High-entropy alloy; Tensile properties","3D printers; Additives; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Cracks; Densification; Deposition; Entropy; Grain boundaries; High-entropy alloys; Iron alloys; Manganese alloys; Solidification; Textures; Columnar grain; Densifications; Directed energy; Directed energy deposition; Energy depositions; Grain structure control; High entropy alloys; Laser scan speed; Metallurgical defects; Structure control; Grain size and shape","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51805265); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (BK20180472); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","The authors are grateful for the financial support provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51805265 ) and Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (Grant No. BK20180472 ).","Lu Y., Dong Y., Guo S., Jiang L., Kang H., Wang T., Wen B., Wang Z., Jie J., Cao Z., Ruan H., Li T., A promising new class of high-temperature alloys: eutectic high-entropy alloys, Sci.

In this study, a modified GTN (Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman) model was used to characterize void growth, nucleation, and shear mechanism to predict the ductile fracture behavior of SLM-fabricated Ti6Al4V alloys under uniaxial stress states. An intelligence approach obtained by an artificial neural network (ANN) in conjunction with particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms which optimized modified GTN model parameters and found relations between input and output data. In order to assess the accuracy of the results, the PSO suggested parameters were applied to finite element simulation and checked by experimental results in each step; then, the machine was trained by the last data to find desired optimum parameters. The final results showed that the damage and fracture behavior of SLM-fabricated Ti6Al4V alloys under uniaxial stress states are correctly predicted by GTN-modified model and hybrid ANN-PSO optimized parameters. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Additive manufacturing;

The aim of the study was to establish the possibility of combining the technologies of MPS and additive manufacturing (AM) for the possible production of custom-designed implants with increased surface biocompatibility, as well as to establish the MPS parameters that ensure chemical purity of the HA coating and satisfactory adhesion of the coatings to the substrate. The structural-phase compositions of the initial HA powder and the plasma-sprayed HA coating were studied by X-ray diffraction analysis and transmission electron microscopy, and the adhesion strength of the coating was tested according to the F1147 standard of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). The main results of the study are the following: the application of the MPS technology for HA coating with an average thickness of 150±50 μm on trabecular substrates obtained by the SLM method has been shown. The parameters of MPS of HA coatings onto titanium implants with a trabecular surface have been established. It is also proved that using the appropriate MPS parameters, it is possible to obtain a HA coating with a 95% level of HA phases, 93% level of crystallinity, and the adhesion strength to the trabecular substrate of 24.7±5.7 MPa, which complies with the requirements of the international medical standard (International Organization for Standardization [ISO] 13779-2:2018). These results are of significance for a wide range of researchers developing plasma spray technologies for the manufacture of biocompatible coatings.  © 2023 Albina Kadyroldina et al., published by Sciendo.","additive manufacturing (AM);

Titanium alloy specimens were fabricated by electron beam melting (EBM) and laser metal deposition (LMD). The same titanium alloy manufactured by traditional technology (TT) was used as a control. The correlations between corrosion resistance, microstructure and phase composition of titanium alloys fabricated by different technologies were investigated, through the use of electrochemical corrosion testing, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and hardness testing. In this study, it was shown that the corrosion resistance of AM samples is lower than TT samples. The corrosion resistance of AM samples was attributed to the presence of more α′ martensite and less β-Ti phases in the microstructure of titanium alloy than for TT samples. The electrochemical results suggest that titanium alloy fabricated by EBM has better corrosion resistance in 20% HCl solution at room temperature compared to titanium alloy fabricated by LMD. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","additive manufacturing; corrosion resistance; electrochemical behavior; electron beam melting; laser metal deposition; titanium","3D printers; Additives; Chlorine compounds; Corrosion resistant alloys; Corrosive effects; Electrochemical corrosion; Electron beam melting; Electron beams; Fabrication; Microstructure; Scanning electron microscopy; Titanium alloys; Alpha titanium alloy; Corrosion behaviour; Corrosion testing; Electrochemical behaviors; Electrochemicals; Electron-beam melting; Laser metal deposition; Titania; Titanium (alloys); X- ray diffractions; Corrosion resistance","","","","","","","Boyer R.R., JOM, 62, (2010); Li X., Wang L., Fan L., Zhong M., Cheng L., Cui Z., Corros.

Many problems exist due to the very complex nature of the production process. Some focus on the production planning phase, including the nesting problem under many constraints. However, it is not possible to solve the main function without a clear understanding of the nature of the constraints. The purpose of this research is to present a method to automate the surface roughness estimation process in the production planning phase. The significance of this study is to implement a data-driven model for one of the most critical decision constraints in the nesting process. Solving this problem will automate a key decision constraint, and it might be implemented as an automated constraint module in solving the nesting problem. The proposed model focused on selective laser sintering (SLS) technology based on polyamide 12 powder applications. A comprehensive dataset is designed to simulate the behaviour of an industrial SLS manufacturing process based on a 3D positioning strategy. A set of samples with random positions are also created to test present the model’s robustness. The proposed classification model is based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) with hyper-parameters designed for the problem. The dataset and the model provide a new user interface to estimate the surface roughness depending on the coordinates of a given product surface in an SLS production chamber and the production parameters employed in the production planning phase. The results show that the model can classify sample surfaces as “rough” or “smooth” with a very high percentage (95.8%) for the training set and with 100% for the test set. Benchmark results also show that the model outperforms other machine learning methods in classifying the surface roughness successfully on the test set. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Additive manufacturing; Advanced manufacturing; Artificial Intelligence; Deep Neural Networks; Selective laser sintering; Surface roughness","3D printers; Additives; Classification (of information); Laser heating; Learning systems; Planning; Production control; Sintering; Surface roughness; User interfaces; Advanced manufacturing; Classification models; Complex nature; Computational modelling; Decision constraints; Model-based OPC; Planning phasis; Production Planning; Production process; Test sets; Deep neural networks","","","","","ISTKA; T.

Therefore, in the current work, new designs are proposed for lightweight 3D scaffolds based on Voronoi tessellation with high porosity. The proposed designs are inspired by nature, which has undoubtedly proven to be the best designer. Thus, the Rhinoceros 7/Grasshopper software was used to design three geometric models for both normal and elongated Voronoi structures: homogeneous, gradient I, and gradient II. Then, stereolithography (SLA) additive manufacturing was utilized to fabricate biopolymeric materials. Finally, a compression test was carried out to study and compare the mechanical properties of the designed samples. The gradient I cylinder show the highest Young’s modulus. For the Homogeneous and gradient II cylinders, elongated Voronoi structures show superior mechanical properties and energy absorption compared to normal Voronoi designs. Hence, these designs are promising topologies for future applications. © 2022 by the authors.","3D Voronoi tessellation; additive manufacturing; bio-inspired; mechanical properties","article; Caelifera; compression; controlled study; energy absorption; geometry; nonhuman; porosity; software; stereolithography; three dimensional printing","","","","","","","Cima L.G., Vacanti J.P., Vacanti C., Ingber D., Mooney D., Langer R., Tissue engineering by cell transplantation using degradable polymer substrates, J.

For composite applications, the balance of material properties, including rigidity and toughness, needs to be considered. To overcome the drawbacks induced by single continuous fiber reinforcement, this study focused on the design and characterization of hybrid continuous fiber (continuous carbon and Kevlar fibers)-reinforced polyamide (PA)-based composites, prepared by 3D printing, to achieve comprehensive performance improvements and designable mechanical properties. The deformation and failure behaviors with the effects of hybrid conception, stacking sequences, and raster orientations of composites were investigated. A hybrid effect model was introduced to evaluate the hybrid effect of 3D printed continuous fiber-filled composites. Besides, compared to composites fabricated via conventional methods, a major difference in 3D printed hybrid composites is the performance of interfacial bonding. A roller peeling test was therefore conducted to investigate the interfacial strength of different materials. An analytical approach was developed to predict the tensile modulus of the printed hybrid composites by introducing an interfacial strengthening coefficient into the volume average stiffness model. The combined experimental and predicted results showed that hybrid composite specimens with separated distribution sequence showed a higher tensile modulus compared to hybrid composites with concentrated distribution. The higher tensile properties of the printed hybrid composites with separated continuous fiber-reinforced layers were attributed to the strong interfacial bonding, which delayed crack initiation and propagation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Fused deposition modeling; Hybrid continuous fiber; Hybrid effect model; Interfacial properties; Prediction model; Raster orientation; Stacking sequence","Deposition; Elastic moduli; Fibers; Fused Deposition Modeling; Layered manufacturing; Reinforced plastics; Continuous fibers; Effect model; Filled composites; Hybrid composites; Hybrid continuous fiber; Hybrid effect model; Interfacial property; Prediction modelling; Raster orientation; Stacking sequence; Hybrid composites","","","","","Hu-Xiang Youth Talent Program, (2020RC3009); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, NNSF, NSF, NSFC, (51905555); Central South University, CSU; Innovation-Driven Project of Central South University, (2019CX017); Huxiang Youth Talent Support Program","Author Kui Wang would like to acknowledge the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51905555), the Hu-Xiang Youth Talent Program (2020RC3009), and the Innovation-Driven Project of Central South University (No. 2019CX017) for supporting the experimental research in this work.

Compared with traditional manufacturing technologies, AM methods are highly automated to reduce waste, assembly costs, and processing errors. By combining different AM deposition methods, we can fabricate composite materials with desired spatial arrangements and anisotropies to meet unique design requirements and to produce integrated multi-material components that are not easily manufactured by traditional strategies. To address a wide variety of mechanical performance requirements, developing hybrid AM technologies into a low-cost, fully-automated manufacturing process can realize a number of new types of elastomer composite architectures. In this work, FFF and DIW methods have been combined to fabricate thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) reinforced silicone composite materials. Several specimens with different silicone and TPU infill patterns have been designed to characterize the mechanical compression responses of these structures. With 40–80% infill percentages of silicone and 20–60% infill percentages of TPU, composites specimens can be designed to get any specified compression response between 600 N and 9000 N. This TPU-reinforced silicone printing technique can be applied for silicone composite architecture design in a wide range of applications that require tunable elastic responses. © The Author(s) 2022.","additive manufacturing; compression; elastomeric architectures; silicone rubber-based composites","3D printers; Additives; Infill drilling; Silicone rubber; Composite architectures; Composites material; Compression; Elastomeric architecture; Elastomeric composite; Manufacturing methods; Silicone composites; Silicone rubber; Silicone rubber-based composite; Thermoplastic polyurethanes; Reinforced plastics","","","","","Tweed & Co.","We would like to acknowledge funding from Greene, Tweed & Co. for this work.

A closed-form thermal model is developed to consider the complex mechanisms of laser powder absorption in keyhole melting mode, which consists of two heat sources. A moving circular heat source solution is employed to calculate the temperature increase caused by the laser powder absorbed in the keyhole mouth due to the thermal effects of plasma. A moving cylindrical heat source solution with finite length is employed to calculate the temperature rise due to the laser powder absorbed by the keyhole walls. The radius of the circular and cylindrical heat sources is equal to the laser spot radius. The total temperature distribution in the keyhole mode is the superposition of the results of two heat source solutions. The geometries of molten pool and vapor depression are then determined by comparing the calculated temperature profile with the melting point and boiling point of the material, respectively. The proposed analytical thermal model has been experimentally validated. The predictions of molten pool size and vapor depression depth show good agreement with experimental results of Ti6Al4V in LPBF. The analytical modeling method has high computational efficiency because no finite element-based numerical calculations are incorporated in this method. Thus, the proposed analytical model will become a low-cost tool to help the researchers conduct rapid simulation of the melting process in LPBF and avoid the expensive trial-and-errors in experimental investigations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Analytical thermal model;

The single layer thickness increased from 1.7 mm to 3.0 mm when the rotation speed was reduced from 800 r/min to 400 r/min for a given layer thickness of 4 mm. The grain size at the interface was refined to 3.8–5.0 μm at 800 r/min because less recrystallization occurred, resulting in a higher geometrically necessary dislocations density. The grains formed at the interface at 800 r/min were mainly determined by recrystallization textures Cube, CubeRD, and CubeND and deformation texture S. However, a stronger coupling effect between heat and plastic deformation at 600 r/min leads to the dominance of shear textures B/B‾ and RtCu and deformation textures S. The final deposits superior to the wrought Al alloy 5083-H112 in terms of tensile properties were obtained at 600 r/min due to the largest contribution of grain refinement strengthening. Grain refinement increases strength at the interface and interlayer by 113.1 MPa and 92.1 MPa, respectively. The tensile strength, yield strength, and elongation at break in the Z direction reach 290.2 MPa, 163.3 MPa, and 12.6%, respectively. Due to the existence of kissing bonding at 800 rpm, the value of the elongation at break in the Z direction is only 19% of the value in the X direction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Al–Mg alloy; Microstructure; Solid-state additive manufacturing; Strength mechanism; Tensile anisotropy","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Anisotropy; Deposition; Extrusion; Fabrication; Friction stir welding; Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; Magnesium alloys; Recrystallization (metallurgy); Shear flow; Tensile strength; Textures; AlMg alloy; Deformation texture; Effects of rotation; Elongation-at-break; Layer thickness; Rotation speed; Solid-state additive manufacturing; Strength mechanism; Tensile anisotropy; Z-directions; Friction","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51775371, 521753563); Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City, (19JCZDJC39200); Seed Foundation of Tianjin University, (2205006); Tianjin Research Innovation Project for Postgraduate Students, (2021YJSO2B03)","The authors acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51775371 and 521753563 ), the Tianjin Natural Science Foundation , China (No. 19JCZDJC39200 ), the Seed Foundation of Tianjin University , China ( 2205006 ), and the Tianjin Research Innovation Project for Postgraduate Students, China (No. 2021YJSO2B03 ).","Kendig K.L., Miracle D.B., Strengthening mechanisms of an Al-Mg-Sc-Zr alloy, Acta Mater., 50, pp. 4165-4175, (2002); Yi G., Sun B., Poplawsky J.D., Zhu Y., Free M.L., Investigation of pre-existing particles in Al 5083 alloys, J.

In this paper, fly ash (FA), silica fume (SF) and mineral powder (SL) admixtures were incorporated into RAC for improving the pore structure of RAC. The effects of admixtures on the pore structure parameters and pore size distribution of RAC were detailly analyzed by means of back scattering electron imaging (BSE), mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and fractal dimension theory (FDT). And the micro characteristics of porosity and pore structure in ITZ were quantitatively described. The results clearly show that the appropriate amount of admixture can reduce the porosity, average pore diameter and the maximum aperture of RAC. Furthermore, the macropores and capillary pores were significantly decreased and gradually changed into transition pores and gel pores. The refinement of pores increases the compactness of RAC, particularly the pozzolanic effect of SF. The newly generated C–S–H gel and the filling effect of SF greatly decrease the porosity of ITZ. In addition, the fractal dimension (FD) of pore volume exhibits a good positive linear relationship to the compressive strength and chloride ion permeability resistance of RAC. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Fractal dimension theory; Interface transition zone; Mechanical properties and chloride ion permeability; Mineral admixtures; Pore structure; Recycled aggregate concrete","Backscattering; Chlorine compounds; Concrete additives; Concrete aggregates; Concrete mixtures; Fly ash; Ions; Mechanical permeability; Minerals; Mixtures; Pore size; Pore structure; Recycling; Silica fume; Structure (composition); Admixture; Chloride ions; Dimensions theory; Fractal dimension theory; Interface transition zones; Ion permeability; Mechanical property and chloride ion permeability; Mineral admixtures; Pores structure; Recycled aggregate concrete; Fractal dimension","","","","","NSFC Key Fund, (U2006223); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51978353); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, (ZR2021QD009)","The authors would like to acknowledge for the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51978353 ), NSFC Key Fund Joint Project (U2006223) and the Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation (ZR2021QD009).

Common SLS processes are incompatible with component embedding because generating voids in the parts developed using this production method is logistically challenging. Here, we use an inverted laser sintering (ILS) process that sidesteps the need for a powder bed, and can therefore trivially generate voids in printed components. We demonstrate this method by embedding an LED inside an SLS part cavity, and then resuming the printing process. The LED is then externally activated, confirming its functionality after several layers are added. This ability could help transform SLS from fabricating passive parts to active systems. © 2022 The Author(s)","","","","","","","","","Yuen P.K., Embedding objects during 3D printing to add new functionalities, Biomicrofluidics, 10, 4, (2016); Espalin D., Muse D.W., MacDonald E., Wicker R.B., 3D printing Multifunctionality: structures with electronics, Int.

However, additive manufacturing induces geometric defects in as-printed structures which may result in deviation from the parent material's properties. The defects and impaired material properties greatly influence the performance of the fabricated structure. In this paper, the effect of build angle is investigated. The angle-dependency for the geometric defect distribution characteristics is verified through X-ray tomography. The mathematical relationship between the parent material's properties and the build angle is established. A numerical model is developed for predicting the mechanical performance of laser powder bed fusion fabricated lattice structures proposed by using the experimental results. The positioning geometric defects are introduced into this model to achieve higher predicting accuracy. This work proposes a reliable and low-cost numerical analysis method based on the angle dependence and helps in predicting the mechanical performance of additive-manufactured complex three-dimensional lattice structures. © 2022 The Authors","Geometric defects; Laser powder bed fusion; Lattice structures; Mechanical performance; Positioning geometric defect","3D printers; Additives; Defects; Forecasting; Geometry; Numerical methods; Experimental investigations; Geometric defects; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Lattice structures; Mechanical performance; Parent materials; Positioning geometric defect; Powder bed; Numerical models","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12002031, 12122202); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2021M700428, BX2021038); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Beijing Institute of Technology, BIT; State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, SKLEST","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (12002031; 12122202), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (BX2021038; 2021M700428) and the Project of State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology.

Herein, the creep response of this alloy produced by additive manufacturing and subsequently annealed at 1050 °C is investigated at temperatures ranging from 500 to 650 °C. The heat treatment produces the typical Widmanstätten microstructure with thin β-lamellae interposed between coarse α-lamellae. The minimum creep rate dependence on the applied stress and temperature is compared with literature data of tests of alloys with Widmanstätten microstructures produced by traditional technologies. A modified form of an equation, successfully used to describe the creep responses of the Ti–6Al–4V alloy with different initial microstructures, was here proposed. The suggested modification introduces a threshold stress, which is related to the presence of finely spaced α–β interfaces and α2-Ti3Al particles. This threshold stress is considered to be negligible when the distance between the α–β interfaces is long and the α2-Ti3Al particles are absent or excessively spaced. In contrast, in the materials with Widmanstätten microstructures, even minor differences in the heat treatment conditions and/or the processing history cause considerable variations in the distance between the α–β interfaces. This coupled with the occasional precipitation of α2-Ti3Al particles results in different threshold stress values. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Creep; Microstructure; Phase transitions; Titanium alloys","3D printers; Additives; Annealing; Creep; Precipitation (chemical); Titanium alloys; Applied stress; Creep response; Effect of annealing; Literature data; Lows-temperatures; Minimum creep rates; Rate-dependence; Threshold stress; Titanium (alloys); Widmanstatten; Microstructure","","","","","Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR, (COMMI 314–337 LEGGE 232/2016); Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR","This research was partially funded by the Grant of Excellence Departments, MIUR-Italy ( ARTICOLO 1 , COMMI 314–337 LEGGE 232/2016 ).

On the other hand, Commercial FFF machines have limits on process dependability and product quality. Numerous parameters can impact the printing process's accuracy and stability. This study created a real-time monitoring system based on acoustic emission (AE) and laser scanning technology to monitor the warpage defect in fabricated parts throughout the printing process. The AE signal generated during the printing process indicates variations in vibration caused by changes in the part's internal tension. It is capable of precisely displaying real-time part characteristics. After amplifying and filtering the AE signal, the frequency and time domain characteristics are retrieved and trained in the machine learning model. Laser scanning depth image data could be utilized to quantify the dimensional changes of the part. After noise reduction and processing, the point cloud data collected by the laser scanner can represent the specific percentage of warpage. The experimental results demonstrate that the machine learning models trained by AE sensory data can accurately identify if warpage of various sizes is formed with great accuracy in real time.

To achieve this goal, two experiments were conducted on a desktop FFF machine. For the first experiment, three normal samples with different raster widths were fabricated, and thermal images of the newly deposited rasters were collected during the process. To process the low-resolution images, a segmentation-based image processing method was proposed. The temperature distributions along the horizontal direction of the raster section and along the raster length were obtained. The temperature features that could indicate the raster widths were extracted and then fed to recognition models for training and testing. The classification performance of the models were evaluated based on the F-score. The models with high F1-scores could be used to recognise width anomalies online. For the second experiment, an abnormal sample with raster width anomalies was fabricated. The temperature features were extracted from the collected experimental data. The obtained features were then fed to the built and evaluated models to recognise the width anomalies online. The effectiveness of the monitoring method was validated by comparing the recognition results with the actual optical images. The support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbour (KNN) were adopted to build the recognition models. The F1-score and online recognition results of the models were compared. The comparison study shows that SVM is more suitable for our situation than KNN. A method for monitoring the temperature distribution and width anomalies of the FFF raster is provided in this paper. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to explore the actual temperature distribution along the horizontal direction of the raster section, and the first study to monitor the width anomalies of the raster in the FFF process. © 2022, Shanghai University and Periodicals Agency of Shanghai University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Fused filament fabrication (FFF);

The ability to directly use a computer-aided design (CAD) model has allowed for fabricating and realizing complicated components, monolithic design, reducing the number of components in an assembly, decreasing time to market, and adding performance or comfort-enhancing functionalities. One of the features that can be introduced for boosting a component functionality using AM is the inclusion of surface texture on a given component. This inclusion is usually a difficult task as creating a CAD model resolving fine details of a given texture is difficult even using commercial software packages. This paper develops a methodology to include texture directly on the CAD model of a target surface using a patch-based sampling texture synthesis algorithm, which can be manufactured using AM. Input for the texture generation algorithm can be either a physical sample or an image with heightmap information. The heightmap information from a physical sample can be obtained by 3D scanning the sample and using the information from the acquired point cloud. After obtaining the required inputs, the patches are sampled for texture generation according to non-parametric estimation of the local conditional Markov random field (MRF) density function, which helps avoid mismatched features across the patch boundaries. While generating the texture, a design constraint to ensure AM producibility is considered, which is essential when manufacturing a component using, e.g., Fused Deposition Melting (FDM) or Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF). The generated texture is then mapped onto the surface using the developed distance and angle preserving mapping algorithms. The implemented algorithms can be used to map the generated texture onto a mathematically defined surface. This paper maps the textures onto flat, curved, and sinusoidal surfaces for illustration. After the texture mapping, a stereolithography (STL) model is generated with the desired texture on the target surface. The generated STL model is printed using FDM technology as a final step. © 2022, The Author(s).","Design for additive manufacturing; Image processing; Texture mapping; Texture synthesis; Textured surface generation","3D printers;

Such cycling leads to different thermal signatures and associated heterogeneities in solidification, solid-state transformation, microstructure, and properties of the printed part. There is, therefore, a need to develop methods to compare thermal signatures in a part with reference to part qualification criteria. In this work, we have developed and demonstrated a similarity analysis procedure to meet this need. Thermal signatures are extracted from in-situ infrared (IR) thermography during a part built using a laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) machine. Layer-wise variations in thermal signature as a function of part geometry were revealed. Ex-situ microstructure characterization was used to validate the results from similarity analysis. Results and analysis confirmed that our similarity analysis is indeed a useful tool for rapid comparison of thermal signatures, i.e., heterogeneity within the part. Similarity analysis was also useful in identification of anomalous thermal signatures. The analysis method paves the way for deploying in-situ monitoring of AM parts for qualification of AM components. © 2022 The Authors","Additive Manufacturing; In-situ monitoring; Infrared thermography; Similarity analysis; Thermal signature","Additives; Metal analysis; Microstructure; Thermography (imaging); Heating and cooling cycles; In-situ monitoring; Manufacturing process; Metal additives; Microstructure and properties; Similarity analysis; Solid state transformations; Solid-state properties; Thermal signatures; Traditional manufacturing; 3D printers","","","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Advanced Manufacturing Office, AMO, (DEAC05-00OR22725); Advanced Manufacturing Office, AMO; Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE; Office of Nuclear Energy, NE, (DE-NE0000544); Office of Nuclear Energy, NE; Electric Power Research Institute, EPRI","Funding text 1: This manuscript has been authored in part by UT-Battelle, LLC, under contract DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the US Department of Energy (DOE).

Despite various options of commercially available bones with generic geometries, these are either biomechanically not very realistic or rather expensive. Methods: In this work, additive manufacturing was used for the fabrication of artificial femoral bones. These were based on CT images of four different commercially available femoral bone surrogates and three human bones with varying bone density. The models were 3D printed using a low-budget fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer and PLA filament. The infill density was mechanically calibrated and varying cortical thickness was used. Compression tests of proximal femora simulating stance were performed and the biomechanical behavior concerning ultimate force, spring stiffness, and fracture pattern were evaluated as well as compared to the results of commercial and cadaveric bones. Results: Regarding the ultimate forces and spring stiffness, the 3D printed analogs showed mechanical behavior closer to their real counterparts than the commercially available polyurethan-based surrogates. Furthermore, the increase in ultimate force with increasing bone density observed in human femoral bones could be reproduced well. Also, the fracture patterns observed match well with fracture patterns observed in human hip injuries. Conclusion: Consequently, the methods presented here show to be a promising alternative for artificial generic surrogates concerning femoral strength testing. The manufacturing is straightforward, cheap, and patient-specific geometries are possible. © 2022, The Author(s).","3D printing; Biomechanical testing; Femur; Fused-deposition modeling (FDM)","Behavioral research;

However, effective ways to mitigate keyhole pore formation beyond tuning laser processing conditions during keyhole mode laser melting are still lacking. Here we report a novel approach to mitigate keyhole pore formation during laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process by using stable nanoparticles. The critical keyhole depth for keyhole pore generation (i.e., the largest keyhole depth without keyhole pore formation) during LPBF of Al6061 increases from 246 µm to 454 µm (85% increase) after adding TiC nanoparticles. In-depth x-ray imaging studies and thermo-fluid dynamics simulation enable us to identify that two mechanisms work together to mitigate keyhole pore generation: (1) adding nanoparticles prevents the keyhole from collapsing by increasing the liquid viscosity to impede the protrusion development; (2) adding nanoparticles slows down the keyhole pore movement by increasing the liquid viscosity, resulting in the recapturing of the pore by the keyhole. We further demonstrate that adding TiC nanoparticles can also eliminate the keyhole fluctuation induced keyhole pore during LPBF of Al6061. Our research provides a potential way to mitigate keyhole pore formation for defect lean metal additive manufacturing. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Keyhole pore; Laser powder bed fusion; Nanoparticle; Synchrotron x-ray imaging","","","","","","","","DebRoy T., Mukherjee T., Milewski J.O., Elmer J.W., Ribic B., Blecher J.J., Zhang W., Scientific, technological and economic issues in metal printing and their solutions, Nat.

Therefore, research about the modeling of this type of microstructure is of great interest to the MAM community. In this work, the prediction of the lamellar spacing of an AlSi10Mg sample manufactured by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), is presented. A multiscale approach is used, combining a CALPHAD (Computer Coupling of Phase Diagrams and Thermochemistry) model to predict the material properties, with a macroscale model of the sample manufacturing and with a microscale model to predict the microstructure. The manufacturing and metallographic characterization of the sample is also included. The results prove that the multiscale strategy followed is a valid approximation to simulate this type of manufacturing process. In addition, it is shown that the use of a generic simulation software focused on metal casting processes can be useful in predicting the lamellar spacing of the microstructure manufactured by LPBF. Finally, the relationship between the cooling rate and the resulting lamellar spacing has been established for this AlSi10Mg under the specific manufacturing conditions considered. © 2022 by the authors.","LPBF; microstructure; simulation","","","","","","ICME; Eusko Jaurlaritza, (KK-2021/00022)","This work was supported by the ICME project, which has received funding from the Basque Government under the ELKARTEK Program (KK-2021/00022).","Dilberoglu U.M., Gharehpapagh B., Yaman U., Dolen M., The Role of Additive Manufacturing in the Era of Industry 4.0, Procedia Manuf, 11, pp. 545-554, (2017); AMPOWER REPORT 2022, (2022); Yap C.Y., Chua C.K., Dong Z.L., Liu Z.H., Zhang D.Q., Loh L.E., Sing S.L., Review of Selective Laser Melting: Materials and Applications, Appl.

However, its industrial application is limited because SS440C cannot be fabricated into different shapes due to its high hardness and low workability. Selective laser melting (SLM) is the most suitable method to increase the workability of SS440C because the SLM process has few restrictions on manufacturing geometry. In order to observe changes in internal porosity according to process conditions, specimens under 36 different process conditions were fabricated by SLM. The changes in microstructure and defect generation mechanism in specimens fabricated under high-density process conditions were analyzed.

The interfacial ferromagnetism in (LaMnO3)m/(SrMnO3)n (LMO)m/(SMO)n superlattices (SLs) with antiferromagnetic bulk LMO and SMO layers is believed to be a result of the interfacial charge transfer (CT). By using in situ optical ellipsometry, it is demonstrated directly that CT and emergent magnetism in (LMO)m/(SMO)n SLs are controlled by the LMO/SMO thickness ratio, chosen as m/n = 1 and 2. The enhanced CT in SLs with m/n = 2 favors the high-TC emergent ferromagnetism with TC = 350–360 K, whereas the reduced CT in m/n = 1 SLs suppresses it yielding TC = 300 K. A complex dependence of the saturation magnetization as a function of interface density Λ = (m + n)−1 with minima at Λ = 0.11 (m/n = 2) and Λ = 0.25 (m/n = 1) was observed and rationalized by the competition of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic contributions, originating from the volume of LMO and SMO layers as well as from the LMO/SMO interfaces. The role of epitaxy stress and MnO6 octahedral tilts in the emergent magnetic behavior is discussed. © 2022 The Authors.

Here we propose a new approach, a novel real-time laser shock modulation of melt pool (LSMMP) to obtain melt pool modifications for yielding HEAs with desired characteristics. LSMMP utilizes a pulsed laser shocking a liquid melt pool caused by a continuous wave laser, enabling non-destructive and real-time modulations for high-performance HEAs. The numerical simulation reveals the convection mechanism of the melt pool in the LSMMP process, and the intervention of the pulsed laser promotes melt pool flow type to convert the Marangoni effect into a multi-convective ring, which accelerates melt pool flow and inhibits columnar crystal growth. Experimental results show the evolution law of the microstructure in the LSMMP process. The microstructure of CrFeCoNi HEAs undergoes a Columnar-Equiaxed Transition (CET), and higher hardness is obtained. Laser shock is demonstrated to be an effective in-situ modulative tool for controlled additive manufacturing. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","High-entropy alloys; Laser additive manufacturing; Laser shock; Melt pool","Additives; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Continuous wave lasers; Entropy; High-entropy alloys; Iron alloys; Lakes; Modulation; Pulsed lasers; Selective laser melting; Design strategies; Element design; High entropy alloys; Laser additive manufacturing; Laser shocking; Laser shocks; Melt pool; New approaches; Process strategies; Real- time; Textures","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51901162); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51901162 ).

This technique can be utilised to generate cellular structures with controllable pore size, pore shape, and porosity. Cellular structures are fundamental in orthopaedics scaffolds because of its low elastic modulus, high compressive strength, and adequate cell accommodation spaces. This paper aims at investigating and optimising the FDM additive manufacturing process parameters of polylactic Acid (PLA) for two lattice structures namely Schoen Gyroid and Schwarz Primitive. The effect of additive manufacturing critical process parameters including layer height, flow rate, and print speed on the geometrical accuracy and compressive strength of the specimens were analysed. In addition, other parameters that have minimal effect on the geometrical accuracy of the printed parts were discussed. A Full Factorial Analysis (FFA) using Minitab software was undertaken to identify the perfect combination of printing parameters to provide the most geometrically accurate structure. In this study, samples of the Schoen Gyroid and the Schwarz Primitive lattices and a solid control cylinder were 3D printed using the ideal printing combination to assess the manufacturability, the geometrical accuracy, and the mechanical behaviour of both designs. It was found that the optimised FDM process parameters for the studied cellular structures were a layer height of 0.16 mm, a printing speed of 50 mm/s and a flow rate of 90%. As a result of using these parameters, the solid, Schoen Gyroid and Schwarz Primitive specimens demonstrated elastic moduli values of 951 MPa, 264 MPa, and 221 MPa, respectively. In addition, the Schoen Gyroid and the Schwarz Primitive have reached their stress limits at around 8.68 MPa and 7.06 MPa, respectively. It was noticed that the Schoen Gyroid structure exhibited ∼ 18% higher compressive strength and ∼ 16% higher elastic modulus compared to the Schwarz Primitive structure for the same volume fraction of porosity, overall dimensions, and the manufacturing process parameters. Although both structures revealed mechanical properties that fall within the range of the human trabecular bone, but Schoen Gyroid exhibited improved structural integrity performance that is evident by its post-yield behaviour. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing (AM); Biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA); Cellular structures; Fused deposition modelling (FDM); Orthopaedics scaffolds; Schoen gyroid; Schwarz primitive","Cancellous Bone; Humans; Polyesters; Porosity; Tissue Scaffolds; Additives; Biomechanics; Bone; Cellular automata; Cellular manufacturing; Deposition; Elastic moduli; Fused Deposition Modeling; Geometry; Medical applications; Orthopedics; Polyesters; Pore size; Scaffolds (biology); polylactic acid; polyester; polylactide; Additive manufacturing; Biodegradable polylactic acid; Cellular structure; Fused deposition modeling; Geometrical accuracy; Gyroids; Manufacturing process parameters; Orthopedic scaffold; Schoen gyroid; Schwarz primitive; Article; biomedicine; cell structure; compressive strength; controlled study; factor analysis; flow rate; fused deposition modeling; geometry; height; human; human tissue; manufacturing; porosity; proof of concept; three dimensional printing; trabecular bone; velocity; Young modulus; chemistry; Compressive strength","","polylactic acid, 26100-51-6; polylactide, 26680-10-4; poly(lactide), ; Polyesters, ","","","","","Ahn S., Montero M., Odell D., Roundy S., Wright P.K., Anisotropic material properties of fused deposition modeling ABS, Rapid Prototyp.

However, AM produced parts can be subject to undesirable porosity, negatively influencing the properties of printed components. Thus, controlling porosity is integral for creating effective parts. A precise understanding of the porosity distribution is crucial for accurately simulating potential fatigue and failure zones. Previous research on generating synthetic porous microstructures have succeeded in generating parts with high density, isotropic porosity distributions but are often inapplicable to cases with sparser, boundary-dependent pore distributions. Our work bridges this gap by providing a method that considers these constraints by deconstructing the generation problem into its constitutive parts. A framework is introduced that combines Generative Adversarial Networks with Mallat Scattering Transform-based autocorrelation methods to construct novel realizations of the individual pore geometries and surface roughness, then stochastically reconstruct them to form realizations of a porous printed part. The generated parts are compared to the existing experimental porosity distributions based on statistical and dimensional metrics, such as nearest neighbor distances, pore volumes, pore anisotropies and scattering transform based auto-correlations. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive Manufacturing; Deep learning; Generative Adversarial Networks; Microstructural analysis; Porosity","Additives; Deep learning; Generative adversarial networks; Porosity; Surface roughness; Complex parts; Deep learning; Laser powders; Local control; Metal additives; Microstructural analysis; Porosity distributions; Powder bed; Property; Scattering transforms; 3D printers","","","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA, (DE-NA0003525); National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA","Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.

The manufacture of personalized maxillofacial prosthesis is particularly important. In this article, the specific method of fabricating Al2O3 ceramic prosthesis for mandibular reconstruction is reported based on digital light processing (DLP) additive manufacturing to address the maxillofacial defect and its mechanical properties were evaluated. Based on Voronoi-Tessellation principle a maxillofacial prosthesis structure was designed to ensure uniform stress distribution. The stress distribution caused by the transmission of occlusal force from implant to maxillofacial prosthesis was investigated. The results of finite element analysis simulation showed that the maxillofacial prosthesis designed according to Voronoi-Tessellation principle effectively reduced the stress generated by dental implants and the prosthesis itself during tooth engagement. The corresponding repair structure shows more uniform stress distribution. The maximum stress of the structure itself was reduced by about 46% compared with other structures. According to the simulated stress distribution, the method of mesh density division was introduced. The maxillofacial prosthesis with gradient pore structure was designed by increasing density in high stress area and decreasing density in low stress area. The fabrication of ceramic maxillofacial prosthesis was verified by DLP. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> porous structure; Compression test; Digital light processing; Maxillofacial repair; Voronoi-Tessellation principle","3D printers; Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Compression testing; Pore structure; Repair; Stress concentration; Al2O3 porous structure; Compression test; Digital light processing; Gradient pore; Maxillofacial repair; Porous structures; Uniform stress distributions; Voronoi tessellations; Voronoi-tessellation principle; Maxillofacial prostheses","","","","","Jiangsu Provincial Key Research and Development Program, (BE2019002); Jiangsu Provincial Key Research and Development Program","This work was supported by Jiangsu Provincial Key Research and Development Program (No. BE2019002 ).

These lattice structures can be fabricated by various additive manufacturing techniques, such as selective laser melting (SLM). However, the sub-millimeter-scale shell thickness and lattice strut diameter of the fabricated structure often deviate from the designed dimensions and lead to noteworthy discrepancies between the resonance frequencies of the fabricated structure and those of the initial design model. In this work, a bracket structure for a satellite is designed via topology optimization-based lattice infill approach and fabricated using SLM. A resonance frequency prediction approach based on X-ray micro-computed tomography and the stiffness equivalence is then proposed. Vibration tests are conducted to obtain the resonance frequencies of the fabricated structure. The prediction errors of resonance frequencies for the first three modes are less than 1%, whereas that of the traditional approach based on finite element analysis is as large as 14%. © 2022, Chinese Society of Astronautics.","Additive manufacturing; Geometric reconstruction; Lattice structure; Prediction approach; Resonance frequency","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12172041); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2020YFB1709400, 2021YFF0500300)","The authors are grateful for the support by National Key Research and Development Program of China (2020YFB1709400, 2021YFF0500300) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (12172041).

In this contribution, a temperature-responsive polymer Poly (N-vinyl caprolactam) (PNVCL), which is normally prepared via radical free polymerization, was used to justify the 4D printing concept. As a result, by using a Stereolithography (SLA) 3D printer, 4D prints were successfully prepared. These prints were able to demonstrate intelligent and reversible expansion/shrinkage behaviour as the temperature increases and decreases. Additionally, in order to examine the differences in chemical structure, thermal properties, mechanical properties, and swelling behaviours of the photopolymerised and printed parts, a series of characterisation tests, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), goniometry, tensile test, gel fraction measurement and pulsatile swelling study were performed on this study. In conclusion, the differences between polymerisation methods are significant; despite their chemical structures and thermal properties being similar, there were significant differences with regard to tensile properties, swellability and wettability of samples. The implications of conducting this study are remarkable, not only in providing a new way of preparing NVCL, but also in demonstrating the possibility of using 4D printed NVCL for practical applications. © 2022 by the authors.","4D printing; material properties; NVCL","hydrogel; poly(n vinyl caprolactam); polymer; unclassified drug; Article; chemical structure; differential scanning calorimetry; four dimensional printing; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; goniometry; hydrophobicity; polymerization; printing; stereolithography; tensile strength; wettability","","","","","Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation, and Science; Presidents Seed Fund; Higher Education Authority, HEA; KLE Technological University","Funding text 1: The authors are grateful to the President of Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest, Higher Education Authority and The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation, and Science for their support of my research and purchasing of materials in this study. ; Funding text 2: This research was funded by Technological University of the Shannon, Midlands Midwest, Presidents Seed Fund (PSF).","Bak D., Rapid prototyping or rapid production? 3D printing processes move industry towards the latter, Assem.

BHTS specimens were fabricated by additive manufacturing selective laser melting (AM-SLM) using AlSi10Mg Al-Si alloy. In order to understand the effect of section angle number on BHTS during loading, quasi-static uniaxial compression tests were carried out and verified by numerical simulation. The experimental results showed that in the quasi-static uniaxial compression tests, the number of section angles greatly improved the energy absorption (EA) index of each BHTS: the average value of initial peak crushing force (PCF) of hexagonal BHTS increased by 108.82% and 43.44%, respectively, compared to triangular and rectangular BHTS. The average value of the mean crushing force (MCF) increased by 74.87% and 45.48%, respectively. The average value of EA increased by 89.02% and 46.64%, respectively. The results indicate that the number of section angles can be used as an effective way to enhance the EA of BHTS. This work can provide a reference for the design of high-efficiency energy absorbers and will be widely used in EA scenarios such as construction, transportation, etc. © 2022 by the authors.","computer simulations; energy absorption; honeycomb structure; metals and alloy; structural impact","","","","","","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2572019AB16); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This research was funded by [Fundamental Research Funds for the Central universities] grant number [2572019AB16] and the APC was funded by [H.X.].","Baroutaji A., Sajjia M., Olabi A.G., On the crashworthiness performance of thin-walled energy absorbers: Recent advances and future developments, Thin-Walled Struct, 118, pp. 137-163, (2017); Cwi A., Ce B., A review of the crashworthiness performance of energy absorbing composite structure within the context of materials, manufacturing and maintenance for sustainability, Compos.

Four-dimensional (4D) printing is a novel technology that emerged with the addition of time dimension to three-dimensional (3D) printing of smart materials. In this technology, the structure that 3D printed transforms over time, leading to deformation. The primary purpose of the 4D printing process is to control deformation type and amount during the process, but little research has been done on the controllability of the 4D printing process. This study presents a model to control the amount of deformation by examining the effect of FDM printing method parameters on polylactic acid (PLA) material using response surface methodology (RSM) for the first time. These parameters include layer height, print speed, nozzle temperature, and bed temperature. The results showed that the effect of the parameters on the height of the recovered conical shape were printing speed, layer height, bed temperature, and nozzle temperature, respectively. In the following, using the central composite design (CCD), high-order models were predicted to calculate the process control conditions, i.e., control the type and amount of deformation with a minor error compared to the experimental results. The maximum amount of conical deformation with a height of 17.63 mm was obtained by achieving optimal printing conditions. With the help of controllability obtained from the effective parameters, two shapes, such as a bowl and a straw hat, were created. © 2022","4D Printing; Additive manufacturing; Circular disks; Deformation; Polylactic acid","Additives; Fused Deposition Modeling; Nozzles; Polyesters; Printing presses; Process control; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; 4d printing; Bed temperature; Circular discs; Experimental parameters; Nozzle temperature; Polylactic acid; Printing process; Shape-memory properties; Deformation","","","","","","","Khoo Z.X., Liu Y., An J., Chua C.K., Shen Y.F., Kuo C.N., A review of selective laser melted NiTi shape memory alloy, Materials, 11, 4, (2018); Shahrubudin N., Lee T.C., Ramlan R., An overview on 3D printing technology: technological, materials, and applications, Procedia Manuf., 35, pp. 1286-1296, (2019); Bodaghi M., Noroozi R., Zolfagharian A., Fotouhi M., Norouzi S., 4D printing self-morphing structures, Materials, 12, 8, (2019); Raviv D., Zhao W., McKnelly C., Papadopoulou A., Kadambi A., Shi B., Hirsch S., Dikovsky D., Zyracki M., Olguin C., Raskar R., Tibbits S., Active printed materials for complex self-evolving deformations, Sci.

Based on satellite altimeter observations and outputs from the eddy-resolving ocean general circulation model (OGCM) for the Earth Simulator (OFES), the seasonal variability of EKE and its associated dynamic mechanism in the EAC region are studied. High EKE is mainly concentrated in the shear-region between the poleward EAC southern extension and the equatorward EAC recirculation along Australia's east coast, which is confined within the upper ocean (0-300 m). EKE in this area exhibits obvious seasonal variation, strong in austral summer with maximum (465±89 cm² s-²) in February and weak in winter with minimum (334±48 cm² s-²) in August. Energetics analysis from OFES suggests that the seasonal variability of EKE is modulated by the mixed instabilities composed of barotropic and baroclinic instabilities confined within the upper ocean, and barotropic instability (baroclinic instability) is the main energy source of EKE in austral summer (winter). The barotropic process is mainly controlled by the zonal shear of meridional velocities of the EAC southern extension and the EAC recirculation. The poleward EAC southern extension and the equatorward EAC recirculation are synchronously strengthened (weakened) due to the local positive (negative) sea level anomalies (SLA) under geostrophic equilibrium, and the barotropic instability dominated by zonal shear is enhanced (slackened), which results in a high (low) level of EKE in the EAC region.

It is of great significance to understand the effect of heat input on the microstructure and nanomechanical properties, as well as the underlying mechanisms. Wire-arc additive manufactured (WAAM-ed) Al 4047 alloys under different heat inputs were produced and studied in this work. The as-manufactured Al alloys showed hypoeutectic microstructure that consisted of primary Al (α-Al) dendrite and ultrafine Al–Si eutectic. The effect of heat input on hardness and strain rate sensitivity (SRS) were investigated through nanoindentation. The nanohardness decreased with the increasing heat input, in accordance with the trend of yield strength and microhardness in the previous studies, in which the mechanism was usually explained by the grain growth model and Hall-Petch relationship. This work suggests a distinct mechanism regarding the effect of heat input on nanohardness, which is the enhanced solid solution strengthening produced by lower heat input. In addition, the heat input had little effect on the SRS and activation volume. It is hoped that this study leads to new insights into the understanding of the relation between heat input and nanomechanical properties, and further benefits to improve the targeted mechanical properties and engineering applications of the AM-ed materials. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; Al–Si alloy; Heat input; Nanoindentation; WAAM","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Grain growth; Microstructure; Nanoindentation; Silicon alloys; Strain rate; Al-alloy; Al-Si alloy; Heat input; Microstructures properties; Nano indentation; Nanomechanical property; Process parameters; Strain-rate sensitivity; WAAM; Wire arc; 3D printers","","","","","China Scholarship Council, CSC; Norges Forskningsråd, (197405, 237900, 251068, 295864)","The Research Council of Norway is acknowledged for the support to the projects (Grant No. 251068 ; 295864 ; 237900 ; 197405 ).

Kaliskiego Street, 49, Warsaw, 00-908, Poland","This paper aims to study and compare the static tensile properties and Low Cycle Fatigue (LCF) deformation behavior of Additively Manufactured (AM) samples made of two commonly used polymers: Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PET-G) and Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS). Such materials are commonly in use in the Material Extrusion (ME) AM technologies – especially in Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) or Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF). That kind of approach would be useful to understand the fracture phenomena of AM parts obtained by means of FDM/FFF technologies which are entirely different than in the conventionally made material, because of the characteristic layered structure of AM parts. The study has been supplemented by additional fracture analysis of AM samples subjected to LCF tests. The conducted research exposed an increased LCF of PET-G samples (36050 cycles at constant strain equal to ε = 0.40%) in comparison to ABS (24586 cycles at the same strain level). At the same time, PET-G samples indicated a significant material softening during LCF testing. Such a phenomenon was better described by additional analysis with the use of the Morrow equation which indicated quasi-brittle cracking with visible brittle fracture phenomena in PET-G samples. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; Fatigue cracking; Fused filament fabrication; Low cycle fatigue; Polymers","ABS resins; Additives; Brittle fracture; Butadiene; Cracks; Fabrication; Low-cycle fatigue; Plastic bottles; Polyethylene terephthalates; Styrene; Tensile strength; Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene; Deformation behavior; Fatigue and fractures; Fatigue cracking; Fatigue deformation; Fused filament fabrication; Low cycle fatigues; Polyethylene terephthalate glycols; Static tensile; Styrene polymers; 3D printers","","","","","Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna, WAT, (22-757/2022)","This research was funded by the Military University of Technology, grant number: 22-757/2022.

The design procedure of canonical filtering functions is detailed. Six design examples of bandpass filters are presented to validate the design methodology. Three of the designed filters were metal 3-D printed using selective laser melting (SLM) in AlSi10Mg and commercially pure copper for experimental verification. Copper filter prototypes were printed in one piece and electro-polished to improve the surface finish. Aluminum filters were printed in three different orientations to the wiper to investigate the influence on radio frequency (RF) performance. All measured results have a good agreement with simulations.

It allows to expand and accelerate human space exploration possibilities. Extrusion-based AM was demonstrated in zero gravity, while the realization of such a process in orbit-like vacuum conditions is currently under exploration. Still, a solution for protection of the UV and IR radiation sensitive polymers is needed in order to prevent their early mechanical failure under space conditions. Vacuum arc plasma based process is widely applied on earth for thin protective coating deposition. Its major advantage is its scalability—from tiny size used in electric propulsion to large scale coating devices. The usability of the vacuum arc process in space conditions was shown in electric propulsion applications in nano-satellites. In this work we discuss and demonstrate the integration of vacuum arc process as a post processing step after Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) for additive manufacturing and functionalization of long polymer structures. Here we address the concept for technical realization, which integrates the vacuum arc into additive manufacturing process chain. More over we present a laboratory prototype, which implements this concept together with a use case, where a previously printed PEEK structure is coated with aluminum based coating suitable for UV radiation protection. © 2022 by the authors.","FFF; high temperature polymers; in orbit manufacturing; PEEK; thin protective coating; vacuum; vacuum arc","","","","","","European Space Agency, ESA, (4000137515/22/NL/GLC/ov); European Space Agency, ESA","This research was funded by European Space Agency (Discovery program, ESA Contract No. 4000137515/22/NL/GLC/ov).","SOLARIS: Preparing for Space-Based Solar Power, (2022); Samwel S.W., Low Earth Orbital Atomic Oxygen Erosion Effect on Spacecraft Materials, Space Res.

However, quality issues of the printed parts, including part distortion and cracks caused by high temperature and fast cooling, result in high residual stress. The theoretical calculation equation shows elastic behavior which is the linear behavior between strain and stress. However, in practice with the additive manufacturing process, strain and stress have nonlinear behavior. So, the prediction of the deformation of a printed part is inaccurate. The contribution of this research is the creation of an Inherent Strain (IS)-based part deformation prediction method during the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process. To have the deformation in the design stage, we developed software for calculating the IS value and predicting the deformation. The difference between the calculated results and the experimental results is still there, so, we proposed an algorithm and developed an optimization module for the system to minimize this difference. In the final optimal printing process, the parameters are derived in order for the real printing process to have the required quality of the SLM printed part. © 2022, Dr D. Pylarinos.

The raster angle and infill pattern are two key process parameters and their effects on flexural properties need further research. Therefore, the present study aimed to print test specimens with varying raster angles and infill patterns to learn their influence on the in-plane and edgewise flexural properties of acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS) material. The results revealed that the highest in-plane and edgewise flexural moduli were obtained when printing was performed at 0° raster angle. In comparison, the lowest values were obtained when the printing was executed with a 90° raster angle. Regarding the infill pattern, the tri-hexagon pattern showed the largest in-plane modulus, and the quarter-cubic pattern exhibited the greatest edgewise flexural modulus. However, considering both the modulus and load carrying capacity, the quarter-cubic pattern showed satisfactory performance in both planes. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy was used to investigate the failure modes, i.e., raster rupture, delamination of successive layers and void formation. The failure occurred either due to one or a combination of these modes. © 2022 by the authors.","flexural properties; fused filament fabrication; infill pattern; raster angle","","","","","","","","Vafadar A., Guzzomi F., Rassau A., Hayward K., Advances in Metal Additive Manufacturing: A Review of Common Processes, Industrial Applications, and Current Challenges, Appl.

Specifically, it is challenging to 3D print robust Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) small implants due to PEEK's high melting temperature and melt viscosity. However, in this study, we efficiently utilize high-temperature FFF to develop the first-of-its-kind patient-specific robust PEEK dental implants with high print resolution. Specifically, we explore the effects of critical FFF processing conditions on the mechanical properties of the implants and subsequently determine an optimized set of processing conditions that are essential in developing durable dental implant systems. Our results indicate that the 3D printed dental implants exhibit good fatigue properties and suffice the clinical and industrial requirements for dental implants.

Sequential layer deposition can lead to the creation of complex parts with minimized material waste, high manufacturing throughput, and increased prototyping ability, while also meeting the demand for mid- and low-volume production. The AM of polymer nanocomposites is a growing area of research because nanomaterial additives can enhance the mechanical, electrical, and other properties for end-use applications. However, the use of nanomaterial inclusions can also enhance the AM processes themselves. Here, we discuss works where nanomaterials are employed as local heaters for fused deposition modeling, as viscosifiers for direct ink writing, and as photothermal sensitizers for selective laser sintering and vat polymerization. We also note the disconnect between the researched AM capabilities and current industrial manufacturing; nanomaterials can bridge the technological gap and lead to new common practices in industrial manufacturing spaces. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.","3D printing; additive manufacturing; nanomaterials","Additives; Deposition; Laser heating; Nanocomposites; Sintering; Throughput; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Additive manufacturing technology; Complex parts; Industrial manufacturing; Layer deposition; Manufacturing techniques; Materials processing; Polymeric resin; Traditional manufacturing; 3D printers","","","","","Ethan Harkin; Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR","We acknowledge colleagues at Texas A&M for their valuable advice on this article, including Ju Hyun Oh, Anubhav Sarmah, Suchi Desai, and Ethan Harkin.

Whereas in-situ synchrotron X-ray imaging and diffraction have proven invaluable tools in understanding of laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), the characterization of the EBM process lagged what has been accomplished in laser-based AM. This is principally due to the lack of an open architecture system. Here we report an open architecture EBM system for in-situ synchrotron X-ray monitoring with complementary high-speed visible light imaging and high-speed infrared (IR) imaging. We demonstrate that the developed system enables the characterization of sub-surface transient phenomena. The open architecture system reported here provides a powerful tool for studying the dynamics and mechanisms of EBM AM process. The promising results reported here may ignite more future research activities on using in-situ synchrotron x-ray techniques to study EBM AM processes. © 2022","Electron beam powder bed fusion; In-situ monitoring; X-ray diffraction; X-ray imaging","","","","","","","","Fu Z., Korner C., Actual state-of-the-art of electron beam powder bed fusion, Eur.

The database was established by collecting published reports on HIP treatment of LPBF Ti6Al4V from 2010 to 2019, employing the following online resources: Google Scholar, Science Direct, Research Gate, and Springer. Using the established model, it is possible to prescribe HIP parameters and predict properties after HIP for LPBF Ti6Al4V parts with high confidence. The model shows great accuracy in the prediction of Yield Strength (YS) and Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS). Of the predictions, 87.5% were within a 5% error range for YS in all datasets, and this value was 100% for UTS. It was found that the YS and UTS are sensitive to the HIP parameters, including temperature and holding time. The initial YS and UTS of as-printed parts are weaker influencing factors for YS and UTS of final parts, as compared with the HIP parameters. The model suggests that a HIP process with a holding temperature lower than 970 °C and a holding time of approximately 2 h is sufficient for LPBFed Ti6Al4V parts to achieve mechanical properties that comply with the ASTM standard of Ti6Al4V for surgical implant applications (Standard Specification for Wrought Titanium-6Aluminum-4Vanadium ELI (Extra Low Interstitial) Alloy for Surgical Implant Applications -UNS R56401-). However, the prediction of strain to failure showed lower accuracy. Only 62.1% of predicted strain results were within a 10% error range. The differences among the printing processes by multiple research groups may have resulted in large variations of structural defects and thus led to significant scattering of the elongation data. The model also shows that elongation after HIP has a higher dependence on the as-printed samples. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Hot isostatic pressing; Laser powder bed fusion; Machine-learning model; Ti6Al4V","Aluminum alloys; Forecasting; Metal implants; Sintering; Surgery; Tensile strength; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Error range; Holding time; Hot-isostatic pressings; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Machine learning models; Post treatment; Powder bed; Selective laser melting; Ultimate tensile strength; Hot isostatic pressing","","","","","","","Herzog D., Et al., Additive manufacturing of metals, Acta Mater., 117, pp. 371-392, (2016); Frazier W.E., Metal additive manufacturing: a review, J.

In the present work, polystyrene (PS) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) polymer have been processed via: (i) fused filament fabrication (FFF), separately accounting for the prior single screw extrusion (SSE) filament production; and (ii) pellet-based additive manufacturing (PBAM), which are two important AM techniques. The influence of printing temperature, layer thickness, printing velocity, and printing technique on the degradation of both polymeric materials is studied by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), size exclusion chromatography (SEC), small amplitude oscillatory shearing tests (SAOS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and yellowness index (YI) measurements. For ABS, SSE-FF leads to more fission (higher mechanical loading) whereas PBAM results in more cross-linking (more thermal loading). For PS, fission is always dominant and this more evident under FFF conditions. ABS also exhibits yellowing upon processing, indicating thermo-oxidative degradation although below the FTIR sensitivity limit. The selected PBAM conditions with PS are already delivering printed specimens with good mechanical properties and lower degradation. For ABS, a further PBAM optimization is still desired compared to the FFF countercase, taking into account layer-by-layer adhesion. © 2022 by the authors.","rheological analysis; stability; sustainable 3D printing; thermal degradation; thermo-mechanical degradation; thermo-oxidative degradation","additive; amplitude; degradation; manufacturing; molecular analysis; oxidation; polymer; stability analysis; three-dimensional modeling","","","","","Universiteit Gent, (BOF.GOA.2018.0002.03)","This research was funded by the Special Research Fund (Bijzonder Onderzoeksfonds—BOF) of Ghent University, under a Concerted Research Actions Project (Geconcerteerde onderzoeksacties—GOA) under the number BOF.GOA.2018.0002.03.","Turner B.N., Strong R., Gold S.A., A review of melt extrusion additive manufacturing processes: I.

Although processing of Ni–Ti bulk materials is challenging, well-established processing routes (i.e. casting, forging, wire drawing, laser cutting) enabled application in several niche applications, e.g. in the medical sector. Additive manufacturing, also referred to as 4D-printing in this case, is known to be highly interesting for the fabrication of SMAs in order to produce near-net-shaped actuators and dampers. The present study investigated the impact of electron beam powder bed fusion (PBF-EB/M) on the functional properties of C-rich Ni50.9Ti49.1 alloy. The results revealed a significant loss of Ni during PBF-EB/M processing. Process microstructure property relationships are discussed in view of the applied master alloy and powder processing route, i.e. vacuum induction-melting inert gas atomization (VIGA). Relatively high amounts of TiC, being already present in the master alloy and powder feedstock, are finely dispersed in the matrix upon PBF-EB/M. This leads to a local change in the chemical composition (depletion of Ti) and a pronounced shift of the transformation temperatures. Despite the high TiC content, superelastic testing revealed a good shape recovery and, thus, a negligible degradation in both, the as-built and the heat-treated state. © 2022, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; Microstructure; Shape memory alloy; Superelasticity","3D printers; Additives; Casting; Inert gases; Microstructure; Titanium alloys; Vacuum applications; Alloy carbides; Alloys modification; Bulk materials; Carbide formation; Electron-beam; Master alloys; NiTi shape memory alloys; Powder bed; Processing Route; Superelasticity; Titanium carbide","","","","","Fraunhofer Cluster of Excellence Programmable Materials; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (398899207)","Financial support by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under Project Number 398899207 is gratefully acknowledged.

Flexible strain gauges are useful sensors that can be used in human health care devices. In this study, we propose a crack-based strain gauge fabricated by fused deposition modeling (FDM)-based three-dimensional (3D)-printing. The strain gauge combined a 3D-printed thermoplastic polyurethane layer and a platinum layer as the flexible substrate and conductive layer, respectively. Through a layer-by-layer deposition process, self-aligned crack arrays were easily formed along the groove patterns resulting from stress concentration during stretching motions. Strain gauges with a 200-µm printing thickness exhibited the most sensitive performance (~442% increase in gauge factor compared with that of a flat sensor) and the fastest recovery time (~99% decrease in recovery time compared with that of a flat sensor). In addition, 500 cycling tests were conducted to demonstrate the reliability of the sensor. Finally, various applications of the strain gauge as wearable devices used to monitor human health and motion were demonstrated. These results support the facile fabrication of sensitive strain gauges for the development of smart devices by additive manufacturing. © 2022, The Author(s).","","3D printers; Deposition; Health care; Physiological models; Wearable sensors; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Gage factors; Human health; Measurements of; Physiological parameters; Printing resolution; Recovery time; Strain-gages; Structural effect; Strain gages","","","","","Ministry of Science and ICT of the Republic of Korea, (NRF-2020R1A4A1019074); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (2020R1A4A1019074); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT of the Republic of Korea (No. NRF-2020R1A4A1019074).","Zhou Y., Et al., Significant Stretchability Enhancement of a Crack-Based Strain Sensor Combined with High Sensitivity and Superior Durability for Motion Monitoring, ACS Appl.

In both cases, process stability and resulting part quality depend on dynamic interactions between powder particles and a fluid phase, i.e., molten metal or liquid binder. The present work proposes a versatile computational modeling framework for simulating such coupled microfluid-powder dynamics problems involving thermo-capillary flow and reversible phase transitions. In particular, a liquid and a gas phase are interacting with a solid phase that consists of a substrate and mobile powder particles while simultaneously considering temperature-dependent surface tension and wetting effects. In case of laser–metal interactions, the effect of rapid evaporation is incorporated through additional mechanical and thermal interface fluxes. All phase domains are spatially discretized using smoothed particle hydrodynamics. The method’s Lagrangian nature is beneficial in the context of dynamically changing interface topologies due to phase transitions and coupled microfluid-powder dynamics. Special care is taken in the formulation of phase transitions, which is crucial for the robustness of the computational scheme. While the underlying model equations are of a very general nature, the proposed framework is especially suitable for the mesoscale modeling of various AM processes. To this end, the generality and robustness of the computational modeling framework is demonstrated by several application-motivated examples representing the specific AM processes binder jetting, material jetting, directed energy deposition, and powder bed fusion. Among others, it is shown how the dynamic impact of droplets in binder jetting or the evaporation-induced recoil pressure in powder bed fusion leads to powder motion, distortion of the powder packing structure, and powder particle ejection. © 2022, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing process simulation; Coupled microfluid-powder dynamics; Phase transitions; Smoothed particle hydrodynamics; Thermal conduction; Thermo-capillary two-phase flow","3D printers; Additives; Computation theory; Deposition; Evaporation; Hydrodynamics; Liquid metals; Powder metals; Two phase flow; Wetting; Additive manufacturing process; Additive manufacturing process simulation; Coupled microfluid-powder dynamic; Manufacturing process simulations; Micro-fluid; Modelling framework; Smoothed particle hydrodynamics; Thermal conduction; Thermo-capillary two-phase flow; Two phases flow; Sintering","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (414180263, 437616465)","This work was supported by funding of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) within project 437616465 and project 414180263.

This combination creates a superior assemblage with strength and toughness. When combining two different materials with large stiffness variations, an interfacial stress concentration is created, decreasing the structural integrity and making the structure more prone to failure. However, nature frequently combines two dissimilar materials with different properties. Additive manufacturing (AM) and 3D printing have revolutionized our engineering capabilities concerning the combination of stiff and compliant materials. The emergence of multi-material 3D-printing technologies has allowed the design of complex interfaces with combined strength and toughness, which is often challenging to achieve in homogeneous materials. Herein, we combined commercial 3D-printed stiff (PETG) and compliant (TPU) polymers using simple and bioinspired interfaces using a fused deposition modeling (FDM) printer and characterized the mechanical behaviors of the interfaces. Furthermore, we examined how the different structural parameters, such as the printing resolution (RES) and horizontal overlap distance (HOD), affect the mechanical properties. We found that the bioinspired interfaces significantly increased the strain, toughness, and tensile modulus compared with the simple interface. Furthermore, the more refined printing resolution elevated the yield stress, while the increased overlap distance mostly elevated the strain and toughness. Additionally, 3D printing allows the fabrication of other complex designs in the stiff and compliant material interface, allowing various tailor-designed and bioinspired interfaces. The importance of these bioinspired interfaces can be manifested in the biomedical and robotic fields and through interface combinations. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing; bioinspired materials; biomimetics; interface; mechanical testing; stiff-to-compliant; stiffness; strength","","","","","","","","Lopes L.R., Silva A.F., Carneiro O.S., Multi-Material 3D Printing: The Relevance of Materials Affinity on the Boundary Interface Performance, Addit.

The super-transus heat treatment results in the removal of columnar prior β grains and formation of equiaxed grains that consist of α colonies. The WQ triggers the formation of a bimodal microstructure of α and α´ phases, and the volume fraction of α´ phase increases with increasing the WQ temperature. The STA process leads to a high yield strength (σy: ~658 MPa) and an elongation to fracture (εf: ~14.8%) when tested at 500 °C. The super-transus heat treatment results in a lower yield strength at both room and elevated temperatures due to coarsening of the α laths. The WQ process allows for the tailoring of the tensile property in a broad window, and the yield strength increased with increasing WQ temperatures. Particularly, the 885 and 925-WQ samples showed a remarkably enhanced strain hardening behavior during tensile tests. The 925-WQ samples exhibited a high σy of ~706 MPa and an εf of ~11.0% at elevated temperature. The samples that underwent STA processing and 925-WQ showed a higher σy while maintaining a decent ductility relative to the conventionally fabricated counterparts at 500 °C, indicating the potential elevated temperature applications for the Ti6242S alloy fabricated via laser powder bed fusion coupled with heat treatment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Heat treatment; Laser powder bed fusion; Microstructure, Elevated temperature tensile property; Ti–6Al–2Sn–4Zr–2Mo-0.1Si","Aluminum alloys; Coarsening; Fabrication; Heat treatment; Ostwald ripening; Silicon alloys; Strain hardening; Tensile testing; Tin alloys; Titanium alloys; Yield stress; Zircaloy; Elevated temperature; Elevated temperature tensile properties; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Microstructure, elevated temperature tensile property; Powder bed; Quenching temperatures; Ti-6Al-2Sn-4Zr-2Mo; Ti–6al–2sn–4zr–2mo-0.1si; Water quenching; Textures","","","","","Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR","The financial support from the A*STAR Structural and Metal Alloys Programme (SMAP): Work Package II with project No. A18B1b0061 is acknowledged.

Nowadays, rapid prototyping (RP) is widely used by the designers. Achieving good manufacturing performances needs to handle various process parameters. Most works deal with single objective process parameters. The reality is quite different and the processes involve conflicting objectives. This paper addresses the multi-objective factors optimization of the fused deposition modelling (FDM) technology. The problem is converted into a single one using the weighted-sum method and then solved by resorting to two nature-inspired computing techniques, namely particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution (DE). The results obtained are compared. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Differential evolution; Fused deposition modelling; Multi-objective optimization; Particle swarm optimization; Rapid prototyping; Weighted-sum method","Biomimetics; Deposition; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Rapid prototyping; Differential Evolution; Factor optimization; Multi objective; Multi-objectives optimization; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Process parameters; Rapid-prototyping; Swarm optimization; Weighted sum method; Multiobjective optimization","","","","","","","Mellal M.A., Williams E.J., Total production time minimization of a multi-pass milling process via cuckoo optimization algorithm, Int.

A major limitation of multi-material laser powder bed fusion (MM-LPBF) approaches is the risk of powder contamination. In the present study, the implementation of a concept for manufacturing of multi material parts is demonstrated. A new type of device is contructed, and the new process is tested fundamentally and gradually by experimental means. Aspects investigated include machine and process feasibility, bonding issues, and dilution. Microstructural analysis reveals the successful build of multimaterial basic geometries out of steel powder (316L stainless steel) and both nickel-based alloy and copper foil. This provides a new process whose further research offers high potential for numerous multi-material applications. © 2022, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; Composites; LFPF; Multi-material","Additives; Nickel alloys; Functional integration; Geometric flexibility; Laser powders; LFPF; Manufacturing IS; Microstructural analysis; Multi materials; Multi-material part; Powder bed; Steel powder; 3D printers","","","","","MWIDE NRW, (PO 005–2006-0026_0085); Ministerium für Wirtschaft, Innovation, Digitalisierung und Energie des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen, MWIDE","Funding text 1: Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

In this study, the inter-layer hammering hybrid WAAM process was applied, and a periodic microstructure composed of alternate coarse and fine grain regions was obtained. These regions were defined as the work hardening region (W region) and recrystallization region (R region) according to the respective formation mechanism. The grain size, texture intensity, grain boundary misorientation angle, phase structure, and dislocation density in these two regions were systematically investigated, and their contributions to the mechanical properties were analyzed. The results show that hammering, especially with increase of hammering times, maintains the depth of recrystallization of each layer at 1.0 mm and increases the ratio of the R region. The grain size in the R region was significantly refined, and the dislocation density in the R region was lower than that in the W region due to the dislocation release by recrystallization caused by subsequent deposition heat, and sub-grains were formed in the W region. The best tensile properties were achieved in the horizontal direction when the inter-layer region was hammered 3 times. The ultimate tensile stress (UTS) exceeded 400 MPa and the elongation exceeded 13%. However, the change in pore morphology caused anisotropy in hammered samples. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Hammering; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Recrystallization; WAAM; Work hardening","Additives; Density (specific gravity); Grain boundaries; Grain size and shape; Magnesium alloys; Morphology; Selective laser melting; Strain hardening; Textures; AlMg alloy; Dislocations densities; Formation mechanism; Grainsize; Hammering; Inter-layers; Periodic microstructure; Recrystallisation; Wire arc; Wire arc additive manufacturing; Recrystallization (metallurgy)","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52005351); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province, (2019-BS-186); Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52005351 ), Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province of China (NO. 2019-BS-186 ).","Antonysamy A.A., Microstructure, Texture and Mechanical Property Evolution during Additive Manufacturing of Ti6Al4V Alloy for Aerospace Applications, (2012); Paolini A., Kollmannsberger S., Rank E., Additive manufacturing in construction: a review on processes, applications, and digital planning methods, Addit.

The compression process of the lattice structure of body-centered cubic element was studied by numerical simulation method, and then the numerical simulation results were verified by experiments. The porosity of the lattice structure was characterized by dry weight method, and the compressive and compressive fatigue properties of the lattice structure were tested. The results showed that the actual porosity of all lattice structures with different pillar sizes was less than the designed porosity due to the thermal adsorption of the surrounding powder on the pillar. The numerical simulation was in good agreement with the experimental results, which can be used to predict the displacement changes in the elastic region of the lattice structure. With the increase of the pillar size, the difference between the actual porosity and the designed porosity of the lattice structure increased first and then decreased. The compression resistance of the unit cell topology was better. Meanwhile, the compression and yield strength of the lattice structure were increased. The larger the pillar size of lattice structure, the better the plasticity. It can withstand higher cyclic load and have better fatigue performance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Lattice structure; Pillar size; Selective laser melting; Ti6Al4V","Aluminum alloys; Crystal structure; Fabrication; Fatigue of materials; Melting; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Porosity; Selective laser melting; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Body-centred cubic; Comprehensive properties; Compression process; Dry weight; Lattice structures; Melting technology; Numerical simulation method; Pillar size; Selective laser melting; Weight methods; Ternary alloys","","","","","Fundamental Research Funds of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, (22242297-Y); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2018M642482); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LQ18E050010); Scientific Research Foundation of Zhejiang A and F University, (17022073-Y)","This work is supported by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded project, Grant No. 2018M642482 , Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant No. LQ18E050010 , the Scientific Research Foundation of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University , Grant No. 17022073-Y , and the Fundamental Research Funds of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University , Grant No. 22242297-Y .","Zhang L., Song B., Zhang J., Yao Y., Lu J., Shi Y., Decoupling microlattice metamaterial properties through a structural design strategy inspired by the Hall-Petch relation, Acta Mater., 234, (2022); Cai C., Guo S., Li B., Tian Y., Qiu J.C.D., Sun C., Yan C., Qi H., Zhou K., 3D printing and chemical dealloying of a hierarchically micro- and nanoporous catalyst for wastewater purification, ACS Appl.

In this work, topology optimization method was used to design cellular structures with different relative densities (RD = 0.10–0.30). Subsequently, a series of Uniform Lattice Structures (ULSs) and Functionally Graded Lattice Structures (FGLSs) with different RD gradient directions (two types: G1 type specimens with a RD gradient perpendicular to the compressing direction, while G2 type specimens with a RD gradient along the compressing direction) were fabricated via selective laser melting (SLM) technology with Ti6Al4V alloy powder. Here, ULSs as a reference were applied to investigate the mechanical properties, failure mechanism, energy absorption abilities and properties prediction of ULSs. The designed lattice structures owned comparable mechanical properties with natural bone. The mechanical properties (E = 3.13–4.73 GPa, σy = 96.90–180.05 MPa, σpl = 75.12–98.97 MPa) of G1 type specimens were sightly higher values comparing with those of ULSs, whereas mechanical properties (E = 1.42–3.75 GPa, σy = 15.93–66.21 MPa, σpl = 60.26–92.02 MPa) of G2 type specimens were a notablely lower value than those of ULSs. G2 type specimens exhibited a similar failure mechanism of layer-by-layer with ULSs, while G1 type specimens presented a mixed failure mechanism including shear-dominated and bending-dominated mode. Additionally, mechanical properties prediction methods were systematically analyzed and corresponding mathematical models were established successfully for tailoring properties of FGLSs. This work provides a comprehensive understanding that how to design and manufacture well-performance FGLSs and is significant for porous orthopedic implants applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Compressive properties; Functionally graded lattice structures; Properties prediction models; Selective laser melting; Topology optimization","Aluminum alloys; Bone; Cell proliferation; Fabrication; Failure (mechanical); Forecasting; Melting; Shape optimization; Structural design; Structural properties; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Compressive properties; Failure mechanism; Functionally graded; Functionally graded lattice structure; Lattice structures; Prediction modelling; Property prediction model; Property predictions; Selective laser melting; Topology optimisation; Selective laser melting","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52105445); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (8091B032109); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFB3701800); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (ZQN-1021); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","The work is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Project No. 2021YFB3701800 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 52105445 ), the Equipment Pre-research Joint Fund of the Ministry of Education (Project No. 8091B032109 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Project No. ZQN-1021 ).","Wang Z., Wang C., Li C., Qin Y., Zhong L., Chen B., Li Z., Liu H., Chang F., Wang J., Analysis of factors influencing bone ingrowth into three-dimensional printed porous metal scaffolds: a review, J.

However, these geometries are often unfeasible using traditional processes. Focusing on selective laser sintering (SLS), an additive manufacturing process, this study investigates the mechanical properties of a 3D Greek Cross fractal. The mechanical behaviour of the structure is numerically investigated under quasi-static and dynamic compressive loads in the case of shock-absorbing head protection equipment applications. The material model is tailored and validated by experimental results. The energy absorption results higher up to 77% than traditional foam. However, for features smaller than 1 mm, the induced process defects drastically reduce the mechanical performance of the structure. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3D Greek cross fractal; 3D printing; PA12; Personal protective equipment; Selective laser sintering","Additives; Laser heating; Protective clothing; Selective laser sintering; Shock absorbers; Sintering; 3-D printing; 3d greek cross fractal; 3D-printing; Additive manufacturing process; Fractal geometry; Fractal structures; Mechanical performance; Pa12; Personal protective equipment; Shock absorption; Fractals","","","","","","","Peitgen H.-O., Jurgens H., Saupe D., Chaos and Fractals: New Frontiers of Science, (2006); Mandelbrot B.B., Les objets fractals: forme, hasard et dimension, (1975); Barnsley M.F., Fractals Everywhere, (2014); Oloriz F., Palmqvist P., Perez-claros J.A., Shell features, main colonized environments, and fractal analysis of sutures in late jurassic ammonites, Lethaia, 30, pp. 191-204, (1997); Losa G.A., Fractals in biology and medicine, Rev.

This is an additive technology that eliminated several fabrication steps and at the same time reduces material waste during the manufacturing process. However, in all additive manufacturing technologies, the final properties of the parts are determined by the operational process parameters. In this study, several machine learning algorithms were examined to characterize the effects of the printing process parameters on relative density, hardness, yield strength, and tensile strength in manufactured parts. It was possible by using “Big Data” collected from a large number of previously published articles on the application of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) for the 3D printing of 316L stainless steel samples. Among different process parameters, laser power, laser energy density, and scanning speed were proven to have the largest effects directly on the physical and mechanical properties of LPBF-processed parts. Six different classification models and five support vector machine regression-based models were tested to find the most accurate prediction algorithm. To validate the obtained results from the applied machine learning models, a set of 316L specimens were produced using LPBF technology using a random set of process parameters. The physical and mechanical properties of 3D printed samples were tested and compared to the ones predicted from the optimum models from machine learning analysis. The results were in great agreement, which shows the high accuracy of the developed machine learning algorithms in this study. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Laser powder bed fusion; Machine learning algorithm; Mechanical properties; Microstructural characterization; Process parameter optimization","3D printers; Additives; Density (specific gravity); Learning algorithms; Parameter estimation; Powder metals; Support vector machines; Tensile strength; 316 L stainless steel; 3D-printing; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Microstructural characterizations; Powder bed; Process parameters; Process parameters optimizations; Austenitic stainless steel","","","","","","","Hamza H.M., Deen K.M., Khaliq A., Asselin E., Haider W., Microstructural, corrosion and mechanical properties of additively manufactured alloys: A review, Crit Rev Solid State Mater Sci, pp. 1-53, (2021); Fayazfar H., Salarian M., Rogalsky A., Sarker D., Russo P., Paserin V., Toyserkani E., A critical review of powder-based additive manufacturing of ferrous alloys: process parameters, microstructure and mechanical properties, Mater Des, 144, pp. 98-128, (2018); Kok Y., Tan X.P., Wang P., Nai M.L.S., Loh N.H., Liu E., Tor S.B., Anisotropy and heterogeneity of microstructure and mechanical properties in metal additive manufacturing: a critical review, Mater Des, 139, pp. 565-586, (2018); Gao W., Zhang Y., Ramanujan D., Ramani K., Chen Y., Williams C.B., Wang C.C.L., Shin Y.C., Zhang S., Zavattieri P.D., The status, challenges, and future of additive manufacturing in engineering, Comput Aided Des, 69, pp. 65-89, (2015); Gu D., Chen H., Selective laser melting of high strength and toughness stainless steel parts: the roles of laser hatch style and part placement strategy, Mater Sci Eng: A, 725, pp. 419-427, (2018); Kruth J., Mercelis P., van Vaerenbergh J., Froyen L., Rombouts M., Binding mechanisms in selective laser sintering and selective laser melting, Rapid Prototyp J, 11, pp. 26-36, (2005); Chua C.K., Wong C.H., Yeong W.Y., Standards, quality control, and measurement sciences in 3D printing and additive manufacturing, (2017); Gong H., Snelling D., Kardel K., Carrano A., Comparison of stainless steel 316L parts made by FDM- and SLM-based additive manufacturing processes, JOM, 71, pp. 880-885, (2019); Chao Q., Thomas S., Birbilis N., Cizek P., Hodgson P.D., Fabijanic D., The effect of post-processing heat treatment on the microstructure, residual stress and mechanical properties of selective laser melted 316L stainless steel, Mater Sci Eng: A, 821, (2021); Kong D., Dong C., Ni X., Zhang L., Yao J., Man C., Cheng X., Xiao K., Li X., Mechanical properties and corrosion behavior of selective laser melted 316L stainless steel after different heat treatment processes, J Mater Sci Technol, 35, pp. 1499-1507, (2019); Afkhami S., Dabiri M., Piili H., Bjork T., Effects of manufacturing parameters and mechanical post-processing on stainless steel 316L processed by laser powder bed fusion, Mater Sci Eng: A.

However, little is known so far about the thermal properties of the tool steels fabricated by AM, as well as how to balance between the thermal and mechanical properties. In this work, an H13 tool steel was processed by selective laser melting (SLM) followed by heat treatments and the thermal and mechanical properties in relation to microstructure were investigated. The as-built H13 showed lower thermal conductivities compared with conventional counterparts and exhibited anisotropy with a lower thermal conductivity along the building direction. Heat treatments generally increased the values of thermal conductivities and largely reduced anisotropy, but the final thermal conductivity differed when using different heat-treating schedules. It was found that porosity, retained austenite, the melt-pool structure and the ultra-fine cellular-columnar microstructure, which were functions of SLM and heat-treating parameters, were factors determining the thermal conductivity of H13. Based on the present study of SLMed H13, it is proposed that a trade-off is necessary between thermal and mechanical properties when designing the processing route. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; H13 tool steel; Selective laser melting; Thermal conductivity","Additives; Economic and social effects; Heat treatment; Melting; Microstructure; Selective laser melting; Thermal conductivity; Tool steel; Tools; Additive manufacturing technology; Cooling efficiency; H13 tool steel; Heat treating; Hot-work tool steel; Low thermal conductivity; Molds and dies; Retained austenite; Selective laser melting; Thermal and mechanical properties; Anisotropy","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52076041); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (BK20200371, JSSCBS20210110); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Southeast University, SEU, (AMM2021A02); Southeast University, SEU; Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Advanced Metallic Materials","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52076041), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (Grant No. BK20200371), the Jiangsu Shuangchuang (Mass Innovation and Entrepreneurship) Program (Grant No. JSSCBS20210110), and the research fund of Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Advanced Metallic Materials, Southeast University (Grant No. AMM2021A02).

In this paper, the tribological characteristic of the SLM Co-Cr alloy underwent various HT temperature and was investigated by in-situ nano-scratch with progressive loading, normal loading, and cyclic loading test methods. As results, the scratch mechanism of all the samples is adhesion mechanism regardless of the loading method. Moreover, as the HT temperature increased, the wear resistance initially increased and then dropped, and the critical load, nano-hardness, and H3/E2 value obtain their maximum value at 950 °C, as well as the lowest scratch and residual depths, indicating the highest scratch resistance. The presented work could facilitate a comprehensive understanding of nano-tribological behaviors of the SLM fabricated Co-Cr alloy. © 2022, ASM International.","heat treatment; nano-scratch; nano-tribological behaviour; selective laser manufacturing","Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Cyclic loads; Dental alloys; Fabrication; Heat treatment; Melting; Selective laser melting; Testing; Tribology; Wear of materials; Wear resistance; Case investigations; Clinical use; Heat treatment temperature; Heat-treatment effects; Laser manufacturing; Nano-scratch; Nano-tribological behavior; Selective laser manufacturing; Selective laser melting; Tribological behaviour; Binary alloys","","","","","School of Aeronautics and Astronautics of Sichuan University","This work was adequately sponsored by the School of Aeronautics and Astronautics of Sichuan University.
