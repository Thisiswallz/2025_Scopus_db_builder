This fundamental knowledge is essential to further develop additive manufacturing routes such as production of low cost parts and in-situ reduction of the ore during processing. Design/methodology/approach: Blown powder directed energy deposition was used as the processing method. The process was observed through high-speed imaging, and computed tomography was used to analyse the specimens. Findings: The experimental trials give preliminary results showing potential for the processability of iron ore for additive manufacturing. A large and stable melt pool is formed in spite of the inhomogeneous material used. Single and multilayer tracks could be deposited. Although smooth and even on the surface, the single layer tracks displayed porosity. In case of multilayered tracks, delamination from the substrate material and deformation can be seen. High-speed videos of the process reveal various process phenomena such as melting of ore powder during feeding, cloud formation, melt pool size, melt flow and spatter formation. Originality/value: Very little literature is available that studies the possible use of ore in additive manufacturing. Although the process studied here is not industrially useable as is, it is a step towards processing cheap unprocessed material with a laser beam. © 2021, Himani Naesstroem, Frank Brückner and Alexander F.H.

Zinc (Zn) is widely applied to strengthen the biological properties of polymers due to its excellent osteogenic activity. In the present study, Zn-doped mesoporous silica (Zn-MS) particles were synthesized by one-pot hydrothermal method. Then, the particles were induced into PLLA scaffolds prepared by selective laser sintering technique, aiming to improve their osteogenic activity. Our results showed that the synthesized particles possessed rosette-like morphology and uniform mesoporous structure, and the composite scaffold displayed the sustained release of Zn ion in a low concentration range, which was attributed to the shield effect of the PLLA matrix and the strong bonding interaction of Si-O-Zn. The scaffold could evidently promote osteogenesis differentiation of mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells by upregulating their osteogenesis-related gene expression. Besides, Zn-MS particles could significantly increase the compressive strength of the PLLA scaffold because of their rosettelike morphology and mesoporous structure, which can form micromechanical interlocking with the PLLA matrix. The Zn-MS particles possess great potential to improve various polymer scaffold properties due to their advantageous morphology and physicochemical properties. © 2021 Qian, et al.

The first stage in SFF methods is to compute the focus value of every pixel by converting the colored images into gray scale and then apply the focus measure operator. Converting colored values in the images into gray scale values may lead to imprecise mapping of pixels with different colored values onto the same gray scale value, this affects the overall accuracy of the system. In a colored image, the focused pixels maintain a considerable color difference from their neighboring pixels as compared to the defocused ones, which are blended into their neighborhood. This article presents an alternative method to measure the degree of focus by directly processing colored images. The color differences of the neighbor pixels with respect to the central pixel are obtained and summed together, this is followed by calculating their spread. The sum and the spread are combined to measure the degree of focus of the pixel in consideration. The proposed focus measure is then used for shape recovery of various simulated and real objects and is compared with previous techniques. The comparison results show the proposed method has the highest correlation and smallest RMSE values confirming the effectiveness of using color images for shape recovery.  © 2013 IEEE.","3D shape recovery; Color focus measure; focus measure operators; shape from focus","Color; Colorimetry; Recovery; Shape optimization; Color difference; Colored images; Comparison result; Focus measure operator; Focus measurement; Gray scale values; Overall accuracies; Shape from focus; Pixels","","","","","","","Anand A., Moon I., Javidi B., Automated disease identification with 3-D optical imaging: A medical diagnostic tool, Proc.

Design/methodology/approach: Pure M50 (MA) and MS are prepared by selective laser melting and vacuum-pressure infiltration technology. The tribological and friction noise properties of MA and MS are tested through dry sliding friction and then the influential mechanism of surface wear sate on friction noise is investigated by analyzing the variation law of noise signals and the worn surface characteristics of MS. Findings: Experimental results show that the friction noise sound pressure level of MS is only 75.6 dB, and it mainly consists of low-frequency noise. The Sn-Ag-Cu improves the surface wear state, which reduces self-excited vibration of the interface caused by fluctuation of friction force, leading to the decrease of friction noise. Originality/value: This investigation is meaningful to improve the tribological property and suppress the friction noise of M50 bearing steel. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Anti-wear and friction-reducing; Dry sliding tests; Microstructure; Roughness; SEM","Copper alloys; Excited states; Interface states; Microporosity; Selective laser melting; Silver alloys; Solid lubricants; Ternary alloys; Tin alloys; Tribology; Wear of materials; Design/methodology/approach; Dry sliding friction; Friction force; Low-Frequency Noise; Self-excited vibrations; Sound pressure level; Tribological properties; Vacuum pressure; Friction","","","","","Wuhan University of Technology, WUT; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2020-YB-23)","This work was supported by the Cultivation project for High-value Intellectual Property of Hubei Intellectual Property Bureau (No. 2019–45) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2020-YB-23).

Appropriate solvents for precipitation have been identified by a screening approach based on solubility parameters. Feasible system compositions and solution and cloud point temperatures were determined. For the most promising solvent, cyclopentanone, a parameter study on the influence of stirring conditions during precipitation was performed. The obtained products were characterized with respect to their particle size distribution, particle shape, phase morphology, thermal properties and melt viscosity. Under optimized process conditions, PBT particles of high degree of crystallinity with narrow size distribution and a mean diameter of 36 μm were obtained; flowability was improved by dry coating. The initial PBF-LB/P processability was assessed by building single layers in a parameter study using a Formiga P110 machine. Dense single layers were obtained at laser power PL = 11.5 W, scanning speed vS = 4000 mm/s, hatch distance hS = 0.24 mm and layer thickness dS = 0.1 mm. Best to the authors' knowledge, this is the first study in the open literature reporting on a PBT feedstock material obtained by liquid-liquid phase separation and crystallization. © 2020 The Authors","Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS); Polybutylene terephthalate (PBT); Powder bed fusion (PBF); Powder characterization; Processability; Spreadability","Crystallinity; Feedstocks; Laser beams; Liquids; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Polymers; Size distribution; Cloud point temperature; Degree of crystallinity; Liquid-liquid phase separation; Material development; Narrow size distributions; Polybutylene terephthalates; Screening approaches; Solubility parameters; Phase separation","","","","","Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, FAU; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (LA4328/1-1, SCHM3230/1-1, project-ID 409621284, project-ID 409808524); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG","We thank Ina Baumeister for supporting the ring shear experiments and Serkan Büber for supporting the precipitation experiments and initial powder characterization.

We use a numerical wideband steady-state model and numerical algorithm, to study the (I-P) curves, gain bandwidth, noise figure, outpout noise power and outpout OSNR in a range between-20 °C and 100 °C. InP/InGaAsP SLA exhibited a thershold curent as low as 55mA at 100 °C and the characteristic temperature (T0) of the SLA was found to be 142.80C, which confirms the high temperature operation of the device. Moreover, the results show that InP/InGaAsP SLA can cover 3dB operating at signal wavelengths between 1.54µm and 1.58µm with gains of up to 25dB at-200C. This peak slightly decreases with temperature. Furthermore, a high out power saturation of 7 dB was exhabited at-20 °C and a low noise figure of around 2.8 dB was achieved in the deviece. Finally, our model shows the elegant performance of InGaAsP/InP SLA in the range between-20 °C and 100 °C, which makes it a promising candidate for integrated photonics. © 2021, S.C.

Extrusion printing is a versatile 3D bioprinting technique, but its low accuracy currently limits the solution. This lack of precision is attributed largely to the complex thermal and dynamic properties of bioinks and makes it difficult to provide accurate estimations of the printed results. It is necessary to understand the relationship between printing temperature and materials' printability to address this issue. This paper proposes a quantitative thermal model incorporating a system's printing temperatures (syringe, ambient, and bioink) to facilitate accurate estimations of the printing outcomes. A physical model was established to reveal the relationship between temperature, pressure, and velocity in guiding the printing of sodium alginate-gelatin composite hydrogel (a popular bioink) to optimize its extrusion-based printability. The model considered the phenomenon of bioink die swells after extrusion. A series of extrusion experiments confirmed that the proposed model offers enhanced printing outcome estimations compared with conventional models. Two types of nozzles (32- and 23-gauge) were used to print several sets of lines with a linewidth step of 50 µm by regulating the extrudate's temperature, pressure, and velocity separately. The study confirmed the potential for establishing a reasonable, accurate open-loop linewidth control based on the proposed optimization method to expand the application of extrusion-based bioprinting further. © 2021 Li, et al.

In this regard, usage of latest technologies such as Additive Manufacturing (AM) will have a positive benefit towards sustainability. AM processes are becoming sustainable from viewpoint of less material consumption, lesser operational cost, minimum handling and so on. So, it is important to analyse the potential drivers of sustainable AM process for its smooth adoption. In this regard, the purpose of the article is to present a study on prioritising drivers of Sustainable Additive Manufacturing (SAM) using Best Worst Method (BWM). Forty drivers are being analysed from eight perspectives. Data have been collected from experts and BWM has been used for analysing the drivers. The drivers are analysed in respective categories and then global score for each driver has been computed to find the overall weightage and rating of each driver. Key drivers are identified as eco design, green innovation and energy conservation. The practical and managerial implications are being highlighted. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Additive manufacturing; best worst method; drivers; multi criteria decision making;

However, they possess weak mechanical properties and are often unstable in load-bearing applications in vivo. A novel class of flexible Ti–6Al–4V titanium alloy lattices manufactured using laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) serves as a tunable reinforcement for hydrogels, providing them with additional mechanical stability and flexibility, while ensuring biocompatibility. A study on the design parameters of the structural elements of the lattices is performed to evaluate their influence on the mechanical properties of the structure. Mechanical testing of Ti–6Al–4V lattices shows a compressive modulus ranging from 38.9 to 895.5 kPa in the flexible direction. In the other two directions, the lattices are designed to have minimal flexibility. Lattices embedded in a 1% agarose hydrogel show a strain-rate-dependent, viscoelastic behavior given by the hydrogel component with the additional stiffness of the titanium lattice. Stress distribution upon loading is simulated using finite element analysis (FEA) and compared to experimental data using multiple regression statistical analysis. As a proof of concept, an intervertebral spinal disc implant is designed with mechanical properties matching the compressive moduli of the nucleus pulposus and anulus fibrosus reported in the literature. © 2020 The Authors.

High spectrum access and clampdown of spectrum outflow are unique characteristics of hybrid NOMA-FBMC. We compare the spectral efficiency of Orthogonal Frequency DivisionMultiplexing (OFDM), FBMC, NOMA, andNOMA-FBMC. It is seen that the hybrid waveformoutperforms the existing waveforms. Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) is regarded as a significant issue in multicarrier waveforms. The combination of Selective Mapping-Partial Transmit Sequence (SLM-PTS) is an effective way to minimize large peak power inclination. The SLM, PTS, and SLM-PTS procedures are applied to the NOMA-FBMC waveform. This hybrid structure is applied to the existing waveforms. Further, the correlated factors like Bit Error Rate (BER) and Computational Overhead (CO) are studied and computed for these waveforms. The outcome of the work reveals that the NOMA-FBMC waveform coupled with the SLM-PTS algorithm offers superior performance as compared to the prevailing systems. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

The addition of ceramic reinforcement further enhances these superalloys’ mechanical performance and high-temperature properties. For this reason, this paper investigates the microstructure and mechanical property of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additively manufactured HX–1 wt% WC (tungsten carbide) composite specimens. The results demonstrate that the LPBF-fabricated composite was observed to have several pores and microcracks, whilst only pores were detected in the as-fabricated pure HX. Compared to the fabricated pure HX, the tensile yield strength of such HX composite parts was increased by 13% without undue sacrifices to ductility, suggesting that the very limited number of microcracks were not sufficient to degrade the mechanical performance. The significantly increased dislocations were considered to be the primary contributor for the mechanical performance enhancement in the LPBF-fabricated composite material. The findings offer a promising pathway to employ LPBF process to fabricate advanced microcrack-free composites with high-strength through a careful selection of ceramic reinforcement materials. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","","Fabrication; Mechanical properties; Microcracks; Microstructure; Nickel alloys; Oxidation resistance; Superalloys; Tungsten carbide; Ceramic reinforcements; Composite parts; Composite specimens; High temperature strength; Mechanical performance; Microstructure and mechanical properties; Nickel- based superalloys; Tensile yield strength; Reinforcement","","","","","HE Institutions; Welsh European Funding Office; Shandong University, SDU; Llywodraeth Cymru","The lead author gratefully appreciates the financial support of the Qilu Young Scholar Programme (Grant No. 31360082063010), Shandong University, China.

Due to the few manufacturing constrains, Additive Manufacturing (AM) is suitable for automated load carrier production. An automated process call for an automated carrier shape generation taking into account application and manufacturing restrictions. The presented algorithm is based on a dexel structure, whereby undercuts are excluded from the beginning. Large product sizes involve big area additive manufacturing (BAAM), including high machine costs and material dosing problems. To reduce costs, a novel BAAM design with a heated hose is proposed and a prototype is generated and manufactured.

Two separate DED systems, one with high powder flow rates to represent industrial-scale DED processing and the other with low powder flow rates for individual particle tracking, were synchronized with the high-speed imaging setup at the Advanced Photon Source in Argonne National Laboratory. In-situ x-ray imaging of the DED process using both systems highlighted the influence of powder flow rates. Increased powder flow rates resulted in less laser absorption into the melt pool, leading to a transition from a keyhole mode to a melt pool without a keyhole but with surface fluctuations due to powder flow. Increased velocities of particles during powder flow resulted in a decrease in particle melting times and a greater propensity for porosity formation. Overall, better understanding of the interactions that occur during various scales of the DED process will enable flexibility, control, and new materials development in DED-based additive manufacturing. © 2020, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.","","Additives; Deposition; Flow rate; Image processing; Lakes; Laser beams; Advanced photon source; Argonne National Laboratory; High speed imaging; In-situ observations; Individual particles; Materials development; Porosity formation; Surface fluctuations; 3D printers","","","","","Northwestern University, NU; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; US Department of Commence National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Center for Hierarchical Materials Design; Laboratory Directed Research and Development, LDRD; Office of Science, SC; Northwestern Initiative for Manufacturing Science and Innovation; National Science Foundation, NSF, (DGE-1842165, DGE-1842165); Center for Hierarchical Materials Design, CHiMaD, (70NANB14H012); Argonne National Laboratory, ANL, (DE-AC02-06CH11357)","The authors acknowledge the following: Yi Shi, Nicolas Martinez, Suman Bhandari, and Jennifer Bennett for experiment execution and Kamel Fezzaa and Alex Deriy at the beamline.

The efficiency of AM products mainly dependent on the initial powder, therefore, characterisation of pre-alloyed powders become important. In this study, we explored the fabrication of Al0.5CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) powders by gas atomisation process and investigated their powder characteristics according to particle size distribution. X-ray diffraction results revealed the formation of major face-centred cubic and minor body-centred cubic phase by the addition of Al content. The detailed characterisations such as scanning electron microscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy and XPS analysis was carried out to examine the chemical composition of HEA powders. The relationship between secondary dendrite arm spacing and cooling rate was evaluated. The results demonstrated that produced alloy powders are spherical in shape with smooth surfaces, compositional homogeneity, indicating the gas-atomised powders are widely acceptable for additive manufacturing applications. © 2021 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining Published by Taylor & Francis on behalf of the Institute.","cooling rate; gas atomisation; High-entropy alloys; microstructure; powder characteristics","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Atomization; Auger electron spectroscopy; Chemical analysis; Chromium alloys; Chromium metallography; Cobalt alloys; Cobalt metallography; Entropy; Fabrication; High-entropy alloys; Iron alloys; Iron metallography; Manganese alloys; Manganese metallography; Nickel metallography; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Powders; Scanning electron microscopy; Chemical compositions; Compositional homogeneity; Face-centred cubic; Gas atomisation process; Manufacturing applications; Powder characteristics; Pre-alloyed powder; Secondary dendrite arm spacing; Aluminum metallography","","","","","Ministry of Education, MOE; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2018M3D1A1025730, 2019R1A4A1026125); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work was supported by the Basic Research Laboratory Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (MOE) (No: 2019R1A4A1026125).

One of the investigated approaches is a new way of producing structural stalleite elements to save weight, volume and, therefore, costs. This publication presents a functional integrated satellite structure that combines the potentials of additive manufacturing of thermoplastics and miniaturized automotive electronics. The structures’ base is a sandwich with a printed core in which both, the wire harness and automotive micro-electromechanical systems sensors for position and thermal control are integrated. The partial aspects of additive manufacturing and the use of modern automotive electronics were investigated and assesed. In addition, an in-orbit experiment will be presented to evaluate the structure under real conditions. © 2020, The Author(s).","3D-printing; Additive manufacturing; Automotive electronics; Cost reduction; IRAS; Small satellite","3D printers; Additives; Automotive industry; Cost engineering; Electronics industry; Industrial research; MEMS; Satellites; German aerospace centers; Integrated research; Manufacturing engineering; Micro electro mechanical system; Partial aspects; Satellite structure; Thermal control; Wire harness; Orbits","","","","","Ministerium für Wirtschaft, Arbeit und Wohnungsbau Baden-Württemberg, WM BW, (3-4332.62-DLR/56)","Open Access funding provided by Projekt DEAL.

Porous titanium specimens with truncated octahedron unit cells are designed by 3D-Voronoi division. Cubic specimens with the porosities of 85 and 92% are manufactured from commercially pure titanium powder using an electron beam melting process. Compression tests are carried out at different temperatures of 300, 473 and 673 K for three different compression directions of [001], [011] and [111]. In all specimens, the flow stress of [001] direction is highest and the flow stress of [111] direction is lowest. Anisotropic compressive strength can be explained by comparing the bending moment of cell struts. Activation energy obtained by Arrhenius plot is the same as that of base titanium and is independent of the compression direction. ©2021 The Japan Institute of Metals and Materials.","activation energy; additive manufacturing; anisotropy; compression test; porous titanium; truncated octahedron","Activation energy; Additives; Anisotropy; Cells; Compression testing; Compressive strength; Cytology; Plastic flow; Tissue; Anisotropic compression; Cell structure; Cell/B.E; Compression behaviours; Compression directions; Compression test; Open-cell; Porous titania; Truncated octahedron; Unit cells; 3D printing","","","","","Light Metal Educational Foundation","This study was supported in part by The Light Metal Educational Foundation, Japan.","Lefebvre L.-P., Banhart J., Dunand D.C., Adv.

AlSi10Mg powder, used as a master alloy, has been mixed with pure Cu powder through a fluidized bed and the obtained powder mix was used as feedstock material for the printing process. To investigate the feasibility of the process and to discuss the effect of the process parameters, a two-step experimental campaign has been carried out: in the first batch of experiments the energy density has been varied to frame the processing window while in the second batch the energy density has been kept constant and the main process parameters have been varied to highlight their influence on the process. Density, porosity, and microhardness have been chosen as output to evaluate the success of the process. The microstructure and composition phase were studied through scanning electron microscopy and X-ray elemental mapping, respectively. A maximum relative density of 97% has been obtained while a predominant role of the laser beam power has been observed. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.","         <sup>✚</sup>         <sup>-</sup>slm; alsi10mg; cu; density; energy; laser; melting; mixture; parameters; power; process; Selective","Aluminum alloys; Fluidized bed process; Fluidized beds; Laser beams; Magnesium alloys; Melting; Scanning electron microscopy; Selective laser melting; Silicon alloys; Al-Cu-Mg-Si alloy; Elemental mapping; Experimental campaign; Feedstock materials; Laser beam power; Maximum relative density; Process parameters; Processing windows; Copper alloys","","","","","Spanish Government, (DPI2015-71448-R); Universidad de Cádiz, UCA, (UCA/R20REC2017, UCA/REC01VI/2016)","This work has received financial support from the University of Cadiz (University training plan UCA/REC01VI/2016 and Research plan UCA/R20REC2017) and the Spanish Government (Project DPI2015-71448-R).

To respond to shipping market needs, this new process is being developed. FAM technology is a conventional three-dimensional (3D) printing process whereby layers are deposited onto a high-pressure head mounted on a six-axis robotic arm. Traditionally, molds and masters are made with computer numerical control (CNC) machining or finished by hand. Handcrafting the molds is obviously time-consuming and labor-intensive, but even CNC machining can be challenging for parts with complex geometries and tight deadlines. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed FAM technology focuses on the masters and molds, that are directly produced by 3D printing. This paper describes an additive manufacturing technology through which the operator can create a large part and its tools using the capacities of this new FAM technology. Findings: The study shows a comparison carried out between the traditional manufacturing process and the additive manufacturing process, which is illustrated through an industrial case of application in the manufacturing industry. This work details the application of FAM technology to fabricate a 2.5 m boat hull mold and the results show the time and cost savings of FAM in the fabrication of large molds. Originality/value: Finally, the advantages and drawbacks of the FAM technology are then discussed and novel features such as monitoring system and control to improve the accuracy of partly printed are highlighted. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Foam 3D printing; Foam technology; Large-scale fabrication; New additive manufacturing process","Additives; Boats; Computer control systems; Hulls (ship); Molds; Additive manufacturing process; Additive manufacturing technology; Computer numerical control machining; Design/methodology/approach; Manufacturing industries; Mold manufacturing; Three-dimensional (3D) printing; Traditional manufacturing; 3D printers","","","","","Université de Nantes","This work was carried out in the LS2N laboratory at the University of Nantes.

However, scaffold-based bone tissue constructs have had limited clinical translation due to constrains in supporting scaffolds, minimal flexibility in tuning scaffold degradation, and low achievable cell seeding density as compared with native bone tissue. Here, we demonstrate a pragmatic and scalable bottom-up method, inspired from embryonic developmental biology, to build three-dimensional (3D) scaffold-free constructs using spheroids as building blocks. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were introduced to human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) (hMSC/HUVEC) and spheroids were fabricated by an aggregate culture system. Bone tissue was generated by induction of osteogenic differentiation in hMSC/HUVEC spheroids for 10 d, with enhanced osteogenic differentiation and cell viability in the core of the spheroids compared to hMSC-only spheroids. Aspiration-assisted bioprinting (AAB) is a new bioprinting technique which allows precise positioning of spheroids (11% with respect to the spheroid diameter) by employing aspiration to lift individual spheroids and bioprint them onto a hydrogel. AAB facilitated bioprinting of scaffold-free bone tissue constructs using the pre-differentiated hMSC/HUVEC spheroids. These constructs demonstrated negligible changes in their shape for two days after bioprinting owing to the reduced proliferative potential of differentiated stem cells. Bioprinted bone tissues showed interconnectivity with actin-filament formation and high expression of osteogenic and endothelial-specific gene factors. This study thus presents a viable approach for 3D bioprinting of complex-shaped geometries using spheroids as building blocks, which can be used for various applications including but not limited to, tissue engineering, organ-on-a-chip and microfluidic devices, drug screening and, disease modeling.  © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.","3D bioprinting; aspiration-assisted bioprinting; biofabrication; bone tissue regeneration; osteogenic spheroids","Bioprinting; Bone and Bones; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Osteogenesis; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Spheroids, Cellular; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; Bone; Cell culture; Cell engineering; Diagnosis; Endothelial cells; Proteins; Stem cells; Three dimensional computer graphics; Tissue; Bone tissue engineering; Clinical translation; Developmental biology; Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs); Human umbilical vein endothelial cells; Micro-fluidic devices; Osteogenic differentiation; Three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds; bioprinting; bone; bone development; human; multicellular spheroid; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; umbilical vein endothelial cell; Scaffolds (biology)","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1914885); National Science Foundation, NSF","","Amini A R, Laurencin C T, Nukavarapu S P, Bone tissue engineering: recent advances and challenges, Crit.

Given that co-contractions of antagonistic muscles are counterproductive in the net joints moments, SLS might underestimate the co-contractions. Muscle co-contractions play crucial roles in stability of the glenohumeral (GH) joint. The aim of this study was to improve estimations of muscle co-contractions by incorporating electromyography (EMG) data into an upper limb musculoskeletal model. To this end, the model SLS was modified to develop an EMG-assisted load-sharing scheme (EALS). EMG of fifteen muscles were measured during arm flexion and abduction on a healthy subject and fed into the model. EALS was compared to SLS in terms of muscle forces, GH joint reaction force, and a stability ratio defined to quantify the GH joint stability. The results confirmed that EALS estimated higher muscle co-contractions compared to the SLS (e.g., above 50 N higher forces for both triceps long and biceps long during arm flexion). © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","antagonistic muscle co-contractions; Hill-type models; inverse dynamics; muscle force estimations; Muscle over-actuations","Adult; Biomechanical Phenomena; Electromyography; Humans; Male; Models, Biological; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Range of Motion, Articular; Shoulder Joint; Upper Extremity; Weight-Bearing; Joints (anatomy); Antagonistic muscles; Joint reaction forces; Joint stabilities; Load-sharing scheme; Muscle co-contraction; Musculoskeletal model; Net joint moments; Optimal distributions; abduction; article; biceps brachii muscle; controlled study; electromyography; human; joint stability; muscle strength; shoulder; triceps brachii muscle; adult; biological model; biomechanics; comparative study; electromyography; joint characteristics and functions; male; muscle contraction; physiology; skeletal muscle; upper limb; weight bearing; Muscle","","","","","Institute of Sports Sciences/Department; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (143704); Université de Lausanne, UNIL","This project was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation [143704].

To ensure the quality of service (QoS) for the leased resources, both sides (i.e., the user and the provider) create a Service Level Agreement (SLA). Higher SLA violations result in high SLA contractual penalties and increase the possibility of losing the tenant. In addition, the unusual workload patterns of each tenant transactions require seamless adjustments due to the sudden burden changes and variability. As a result, to satisfy simultaneously availability and performance tenant requirements, it is necessary to perform reliable tenant migration and replication to distribute the workload to a flexible set of sites and avoid SLA violations. In this research, a cluster-based multi-tenant database management system (CB-MT DBMS) is proposed, which takes the migration and replication decisions in advance by monitoring and acting before the violation of the SLA occurs. In addition, a dynamic proactive multi-tenant database migration and replication MTDB-MR algorithm is proposed to reduce collisions and inconsistencies between migration and replication decisions for a group of violated tenants. Experimental results show that the proposed MTDB-MR algorithm is the ideal candidate for migration and replication of the violated multi-tenant databases, as it minimizes the total number of SLA violations, the number of multi-tenant clients SLA violations, client sites average response time and total execution time of each multi-tenant client site as compared to the previous algorithms. © 2013 IEEE.","Cloud computing; data migration; data replication; service level agreements SLA; TPC benchmarks","Quality of service; Cloud-computing; Data replication; Data-migration; Database migrations; Database replication; Multi-tenant database; Service level agreement service level agreement; Servicelevel agreement (SLA); TPC benchmark; Database systems","","","","","","","Abdel Raouf A.E., Badr N.L., Tolba M.F., Dynamic data reallocation and replication over a cloud environment, Concurrency Comput., Pract.

The microstructure and mechanical behavior under monotonic and particularly cyclic loading at ambient temperature were investigated. Results reveal a bimodal microstructure containing columnar and equiaxed grains with an average grain size of 75 μm and pronounced texture 〈001〉 || BD. The selective laser melted Invar is characterized by a homogeneous hardness distribution revealing no gradient with respect to the height of the fabricated parts. The mechanical response under monotonic tensile loading is characterized by a fairly ductile behavior. Total strain controlled low-cycle fatigue tests with varying strain amplitudes were performed. The cyclic deformation response is characterized by highly reproducible behavior in terms of stress amplitudes and number of cycles to failure. The corresponding half-life hysteresis loops reveal perfect Masing behavior. Post-mortem fractography revealed crack initiation in direct vicinity of the surfaces. The damage tolerance of Invar is found to be promoted by its high ductility. Finally, a low coefficient of thermal expansion, very similar to conventionally processed Invar, was shown by dilatometer tests in the temperature range of 0 °C–180 °C. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Invar 36; Low-cycle fatigue; Microstructure; Selective laser melting","Binary alloys; Computerized tomography; Fatigue testing; Fracture mechanics; Iron alloys; Melting; Nickel alloys; Stress relief; Textures; Thermal expansion; Bi-modal microstructures; Hardness distribution; Low coefficient of thermal expansions; Low-cycle fatigue tests; Mechanical behavior; Mechanical response; Number of cycles to failure; Reproducible behavior; Selective laser melting","","","","","","","Guillaume C.E., Invar and its applications, Nature, 71, pp. 134-139, (1904); Yokoyama T., Eguchi K., Anharmonicity and quantum effects in thermal expansion of an Invar alloy, Phys.

To provide a habitat for bone cells such as osteoblasts and osteoclasts and increase bone strength at the bone-implant interface, several investigators have created cavities or textures on Ti–6Al–4V alloys to increase the surface roughness of the alloys and enhance cell adhesion and osseointegration. In this study, titanium alloy blocks were fabricated using selective laser melting. Additively manufactured solid blocks measuring 10 mm × 10 mm × 8 mm served as the study samples, and they were not subjected to any post-processing; however, they were subjected to laser surface modification. Experimental results revealed that the laser power and modification speed had a considerable effect on the surface roughness of the Ti–6Al–4V samples. Furthermore, the electrical resistivity of the samples was investigated after the laser surface modification process. ©2021,JLMN-Journal of Laser Micro/Nanoengineering.All rights reserved.","additive manufacturing; electrical resistivity.; laser surface modification; selective laser melting; surface roughness; Ti–6Al–4V alloys","Biocompatibility; Biomechanics; Bone; Cell adhesion; Metal implants; Selective laser melting; Surface roughness; Textures; Tissue regeneration; Titanium alloys; Ultraviolet lasers; Bone strength; Bone-implant interfaces; Laser surface modification; Osseointegration; Post processing; Solid blocks; Study samples; Ultraviolet pulsed lasers; Pulsed lasers","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (MOST108-2221-E-492-020); Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST","The authors thank the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan for financially supporting this research under contract nos.

To effectively reconstruct the multiscale structure and multi-material gradient of natural tissues and organs, 3D bioprinting has been increasingly developed into multi-process composite mode. The current 3D composite bioprinting is a combination of two or more printing processes, and oftentimes, physical field regulation that can regulate filaments or cells during or after printing may be involved. Correspondingly, both path planning strategy and process control all become more complex. Hence, the computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) system that is traditionally used in 3D printing system is now facing challenges. Thus, the scale information that cannot be modeled in the CAD process should be considered in the design of CAM by adding a process management module in the traditional CAD/CAM system and add more information reflecting component gradient in the path planning strategy. © This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), permitting all non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.","3D composite bioprinting; Biofabrication; Computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing; Multiscale structure; Physical field control","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61703265, 61803250, 61933008, 61973206); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM, (19QA1403700)","This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61973206, 61703265, 61803250, 61933008) and Shanghai Science and Technology Committee Rising-Star Program (No. 19QA1403700).","Groll J, Burdick JA, Cho DW, Et al., A Definition of Bioinks and their Distinction from Biomaterial Inks [J], Biofabrication, 11, 1, (2018); Gungor-Ozkerim PS, Inci I, Zhang YS, Et al., Bioinks for 3D Bioprinting: An Overview [J], Biomater Sci, 6, 5, pp. 915-946, (2018); Ng WL, Chua CK, Shen YF, Print Me An Organ!

Here, a frame structure aims to bind PM blocks and iron structure. Non-intuitive design of segmented PMs and back-iron are obtained using multi-material topology optimization formulation. Subsequently, a non-magnetic frame structure is designed through a post-processing procedure, which is proposed using the smoothed fields of optimized PM and back-iron densities. Final design results are converted into computer-aided design (CAD) models and fabricated using conventional or additive manufacturing techniques. Segmented PM blocks, and back-iron structures are processed using water-jet cutting and wire electrical discharge machining, respectively. A frame structure is fabricated by additive manufacturing using a multi-jet printing machine. Using the proposed schemes, two magnetic systems are successfully designed and fabricated, respectively, for maximizing the magnetic field inside a rectangular cavity, and maximizing the magnetic force generated with a C-core electromagnet.  © 2013 IEEE.","Design optimization; finite element methods; iron; magnetic devices; magnetic forces; permanent magnets","3D printers; Additives; Computer aided design; Electric discharge machining; Electric discharges; Fabrication; Iron; Magnetic fields; Permanent magnets; Structural frames; Topology; C-core electromagnet; Computer aided design models; Manufacturing techniques; Optimization formulations; Permanent magnets (pm); Post-processing procedure; Rectangular cavity; Wire electrical discharge machining; Structural design","","","","","Development of Hybrid Electric Vehicle Conversion Kit for Diesel Delivery Trucks; Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, MOLIT","This research was supported by a grant (20TLRP-C135448-04, Development of Hybrid Electric Vehicle Conversion Kit for Diesel Delivery Trucks and its Commercialization for Parcel Services) from Transportation & Logistics Research Program (TLRP) funded by Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of Korean government.","Bendsoe M.P., Kikuchi N., Generating optimal topologies in structural design using a homogenization method, Comput.

With SL, the self-sensing capacity of NCB-cementitious composite exhibits higher and more stable piezoresistivity before or after self-healing. The NCB enclosing SL particles not only achieve excellent piezoresistivity, but also preserve SL from initial hydration. Furthermore, the remained SL can be released for further reactions in the cracks.

In this work, we propose a method of creating geometrically reconfigurable and mechanically tunable multi-stable metamaterials to realize a kind of tunable elastic metamaterial with a stable state during the active regulation without continuous-consuming energy based on 4D printing technology. The underlying mechanical mechanism of dynamic and stable adjustment is investigated through theoretical model, finite element analysis and experiment. The tunable elastic metamaterial can adjust the starting/ending frequencies and broaden the frequency ranges of bandgaps and control the elastic wave propagation. The method of intelligent and active manipulation of elastic wave can be used in vibration-isolated steady-state adjustable equipment and smart wave device. Inspired by electronic technology, we implement a bi-stable logic-gate elastic metamaterial to correctly execute simple wave logic operations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","4D printing; Bandgap; Elastic wave; Metamaterials; Shape memory behavior","Dynamics; Elastic waves; Energy gap; Logic gates; Metamaterials; Wave propagation; Elastic metamaterial; Electronic technologies; Frequency ranges; Logic operations; Mechanical mechanisms; Natural materials; Theoretical modeling; Working frequency; Computer circuits","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11902032); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China: Grant No. 11902032 .

However, although the epidermis may be efficiently repaired by CEA, the dermal layer, which is not spared in deep burns, requires additional treatment strategies. Our aim is to develop an innovative method of skin regeneration based on in situ 3D bioprinting of freshly isolated autologous skin cells. We describe herein bioink formulation and cell preparation steps together with experimental data validating a straightforward enzyme-free protocol of skin cell extraction. This procedure complies with both the specific needs of 3D bioprinting process and the stringent rules of good manufacturing practices. This mechanical extraction protocol, starting from human skin biopsies, allows harvesting a sufficient amount of both viable and growing keratinocytes and fibroblasts. We demonstrated that a dermis may be reconstituted in vitro starting from a medical grade bioink and mechanically extracted skin cells. In these experiments, proliferation of the extracted cells can be observed over the first 21 days period after 3D bioprinting and the analysis of type I collagen exhibited a de novo production of extracellular matrix proteins. Finally, in vivo experiments in a murine model of severe burn provided evidences that a topical application of our medical grade bioink was feasible and well-tolerated.

We develop a comprehensive relief logistics network considering the strategic and tactical planning issues of facility location, procurement, and resource allocation, and including multi-objective mixed-integer stochastic programing model which minimizes total costs of the humanitarian relief supply chain (the costs of the preparedness and response phases), maximizes the social welfare (through maximizing the minimum satisfaction rates among the disaster areas), and minimizes the environmental impacts (ecological impacts of the packaging of relief goods, and CO2 emissions in transportation routes of the proposed network in pre- and postdisaster phases), simultaneously. The proposed multi-objective sustainable humanitarian relief logistics problem (SHRLP) is solved using the Compromise Programing (CP) technique and Lexicographic Optimization Method (LOM). Two numerical examples with different scales are provided based on surveying data of possible Tehran earthquakes. The results of solving numerical examples via CP and LOM methods are presented and compared. The efficient Pareto optimal solutions are also provided to examine different preferences of the objectives. LOM produces better solutions than the CP technique in terms of the satisfaction rates and fair distribution of relief items. Also, the results indicate that the novel model is able to survey and model both the sustainability approach and the uncertainty of a disaster relief condition in support of more efficient and effective plans for sustainable facility locations, and procurement and delivery of reliefs. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Compromise programing technique;

A 250 mm × 250 mm sample, with a total thickness of 6.3 mm (0.26λ0), is fabricated exploiting the fused deposition modeling technique with commercial filaments. To achieve a wideband absorption, a hyperbolic metamaterial with a pyramidal shape is designed by vertically stacking multiple resonant cavities. Lossy filaments are used to increase the dissipative losses and cavities with tailored dimensions are designed to absorb equidistant frequencies to obtain a unitary and flat absorption. The measurements are performed for different azimuth and incident angles, for both vertical and horizontal polarizations in anechoic and nonanechoic chambers. For normal incidence, thanks to the symmetry of the structure, quasi-unitary absorption is obtained over a wide frequency range from 8.2 to 17.2 GHz for azimuthal rotations of 90°. For oblique incidence, the absorption behavior in vertical polarization is better than the one in horizontal polarization. Two cases at azimuth angles of 0° and 30°, corresponding to the best and the worst performances of the presented absorber, are demonstrated in this letter.  © 2002-2011 IEEE.","Fused deposition modeling; hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM); radar absorbing material (RAM); wideband absorber","Fused Deposition Modeling; Metamaterials; Polarization; Absorption behaviors; Deposition modeling; Fractional bandwidths; Horizontal polarization; Metamaterial absorbers; Vertical polarization; Wide frequency range; Wideband microwaves; Bandwidth","","","","","French MOD","This work was supported by the French MOD.","Salisbury W.W., Absorbent body for electromagneticwaves, U.S. Patent 2 599 944, (1952); Barbuto M., Monti A., Ramaccia D., Bilotti F., Toscano A., Design and realization ofMTM-inspired absorbers using graphite resistive sheets, Aip Conf.

Exploring the combination of plasma and catalysts in one system is of considerable significance to improve energy efficiency and decrease harmful by-products. The current geometrical design of monolithic catalysts is not optimal due to the limitations of traditional manufacturing processes. Here, the use of material extrusion additive manufacturing, followed by debinding and sintering to construct alumina monolithic catalysts with two-dimensional channels is suggested. A new feedstock material was adapted to the additive manufacturing process, and Al2O3 structures with unique axial and radial channels coated with Mn-Co nanospheres were successfully prepared for the plasma-catalytic degradation of toluene. The monoliths with radial and axial channels considerably increased energy efficiency with a minor increase in by-products. This work demonstrates the advantages of using additive manufacturing and provides a general strategy for the design and fabrication of monolithic catalysts with two-dimensional channel structures for heterogeneous catalysis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Alumina; Material extrusion; Monolithic catalyst; Nanostructure; Non-thermal plasma","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum oxide; Binary alloys; Catalysis; Catalysts; Catalytic oxidation; Channel flow; Cobalt alloys; Extrusion; Manganese alloys; Sintered alumina; Sintering; Toluene; Volatile organic compounds; Additive manufacturing process; Catalytic degradation; Catalytic oxidation of toluene; Geometrical designs; Monolithic catalysts; Monolithic structures; Traditional manufacturing; Two dimensional channels; Energy efficiency","","","","","Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM, (18520744500, 18DZ2281400, 19DZ2293100); Österreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft, FFG","Authors are thankful for the financial support provided through the Austrian-Chinese Cooperative R&D Projects (Flexifactory3Dp No. 860385 , 3DMultiMat No. 875650 ), under the auspice of the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG), and Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission ( 18520744500 , 18DZ2281400 , 19DZ2293100 ).

The design of the system was carried out in view of its monolithic manufacturing through selective laser melting in AlSi10Mg alloy. As a proof-of-concept for satellite telecommunication multi-beam applications, the feeding network operates in the K band (19.25, 20.75) GHz and in the Ka band (27.0, 29.0) GHz. The system provides four rectangular-waveguide ports and a common dual-polarized circular-waveguide port to be connected to the feed horn. The prototype exhibits measured values of in-band return loss better than 28 dB and a port-to-port isolation better than 19 dB (in polarization) and 50 dB (in frequency). The cross-polar discrimination is higher than 20 dB. In this regard, an elliptical-waveguide line was specifically designed and manufactured to recover a value higher than 30 dB in both frequency bands. The line can be easily integrated in the feed horn to be connected to the feeding-network thanks the ease of customization provided by 3D printing. The insertion losses are lower than 0.5 and 0.2 dB in the K and Ka bands, respectively. The weight of the prototype is approximately 130 g. © 2013 IEEE.","3D-printing; additive manufacturing; antenna feeds; microwave systems; selective laser melting; waveguide passive","3D printers; Circular polarization; Feeding; Horn antennas; Melting; Microwave antennas; Waveguides; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Antenna feeds; Feed horns; Feeding networks; K bands; Ka band; Microwave systems; Selective laser melting; Waveguide passive; Antenna feeders","","","","","","","Garcia-Vigueras M., Menargues E., Debogovic T., Rijk E., Mosig J.R., Cost-effective dual-polarised leaky-wave antennas enabled by threedimensional printing, IET Microw., Antennas Propag., 11, 14, pp. 1985-1991, (2017); Guo C., Li J., Yu Y., Zhang F., Zhu Y., Yang Q., Zhu W., Zhu S., A 3-D printed E-plane waveguide magic-T using air-_lled coax-towaveguide transitions, IEEE Trans.

First, a general unified structure is proposed to represent the adjustable performance functions like the exponentially and appointed-time convergent ones. Then, an adaptive coordinated controller is developed based on a two-layer performance envelope to characterize the transient and steady-state formation maneuvering behaviors quantitatively of SFF system. Compared with the existing coordinated control approaches, the prominent advantage of the proposed one is that the preassigned position tracking and consensus tracking performance is guaranteed simultaneously while maintaining the scheduled formation configuration. Meanwhile, the users can configure and adjust the convergence rate (like the exponential or finite-time convergence) of the formation tracking errors by choosing different parameters arbitrarily in the unified structure for the performance functions. Finally, a group of numerical examples are organized to validated the effectiveness of the proposed coordinated control approach.  © 2013 IEEE.","coordinated control; finite-time control; formation maneuvers; prescribed performance control; Spacecraft formation flying","Spacecraft propulsion; Co-ordinated control; Coordinated controllers; External perturbations; Finite-time convergence; Performance functions; Spacecraft formation flying; Spacecraft formations; Tracking performance; Adaptive control systems","","","","","Key Laboratory of Space Intelligent Control Technology, China, (ZDSYS-2019-01); National Key Laboratory of Aerospace Flight Dynamics","This work was supported by the Open Funds of National Key Laboratory of Aerospace Flight Dynamics and the Key Laboratory of Space Intelligent Control Technology, China, under Grant ZDSYS-2019-01.","Ren W., Beard R.W., Decentralized scheme for spacecraft formation fying via the virtual structure approach, J.

In this work, the overall failure process of twin tunnels were exhibited by a physical simulation based on the 3D printing (3DP) sandstone analogues model, and a safety factor method was also presented for evaluating the general safety of multi-tunnel structure. For checking the 3DP material performance of physical model, uniaxial and triaxial compressions for the 3DP cylinder specimens were first tested and showed that their mechanical properties and failure characteristics were similar to natural rock in general. Then, the overloading tests for twin-tunnel model were carried out and have exposed the critical position of overall failure of twin-tunnel structure through visual observation and automatic measurement. Testing results and corresponding numerical back analysis indicated that the connectivity of plastic strain between tunnels can be deemed as the conservative instability criterion (i.e. yielding of material) and the inflection point of tunnels’ displacement can be deemed as overall failure criterion (i.e. structure failure) for twin-tunnel structure. The safety analysis for underground hydraulic caverns indicated that this method can provide a reference for quantitative and reasonable evaluation of the general safety of multi-tunnels or caverns and the local instability zone of surrounding rock. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","3D print; Instability criterion; Physical model test; Safety degree; Twin tunnels","3D printers; Caves; Safety factor; Tunnels; Automatic measurements; Failure characteristics; Instability criterion; Material performance; Numerical back analysis; Quantitative stability; Safety factor methods; Triaxial compression; cavern; compression; failure mechanism; mechanical property; quantitative analysis; simulation; three-dimensional modeling; tunnel; Failure (mechanical)","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51779251, U1965205); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Hebei Province Outstanding Youth Fund, (2017CFA060); Hebei Province Outstanding Youth Fund","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U1965205 and No. 51779251), and the Hubei Province Outstanding Youth Fund (No. 2017CFA060).

Effects of powder loading to the composition, crystallinity, morphology, and mechanical properties were observed. HAp was synthesized from locally sourced nanoprecipitated calcium carbonate and served as the filler for the PLA matrix. The 0, 5, 10, and 15 wt. % HAp biocomposite filaments were formed using a twin-screw extruder. The resulting filaments were 3D printed in an Ultimaker S5 machine utilizing a fused deposition modeling technology. Successful incorporation of HAp and PLA was observed using infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The mechanical properties of pure PLA had improved on the incorporation of 15% HAp; from 32.7 to 47.3 MPa in terms of tensile strength; and 2.3 to 3.5 GPa for stiffness. Moreover, the preliminary in vitro bioactivity test of the 3D printed PLA/HAp biocomposite samples in simulated body fluid (SBF) indicated varying weight gains and the presence of apatite species’ XRD peaks. The HAp particles embedded in the PLA matrix acted as nucleation sites for the deposition of salts and apatite species from the SBF solution. © 2021 Custodio, et al","3D printing; Hydroxyapatite; Polylactic acid; Simulated body fluid","","","","","","Advanced Device and Materials Testing Laboratory; Department of Science and Technology, Philippines, DOST; Department of Science and Technology, Republic of the Philippines, DOST","We acknowledge the funding of this research project from the Department of Science and Technology – Grants-In- Aid (Department of Science and Technology [DOST]- GIA).

A two-dimensional finite difference model (FDM) was developed to describe transverse concentration profiles for flows containing transverse variations in velocity and transverse dispersion, from a steady solute input. The FDM was employed inversely, to optimize the parameters describing the transverse distribution of the transverse dispersion coefficient for vegetation generated shear layers. When laboratory data are available, continuous function descriptions produce slightly improved FDM modelled solute concentration profiles compared with simplified step discontinuity velocity and dispersion inputs. When laboratory data are not available, estimates of step or continuous transverse distributions from other work enable concentration profiles to be predicted with a similar goodness of fit. This paper presents a validated, simple, robust finite difference model to describe the mixing of solutes in a channel containing marginal vegetation. © 2020 The Author(s).

This demand has resulted in the fabrication of numerous two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) in-vitro alveolar lung models. The ability to fabricate these 3D in-vitro alveolar lung models in an automated manner with high repeatability and reliability is important for potential scalable production. In this study, we reported the fabrication of human triple-layered alveolar lung models comprising of human lung epithelial cells, human endothelial cells, and human lung fibroblasts using the drop-on-demand (DOD) 3D bioprinting technique. The polyvinylpyrrolidone-based bio-inks and the use of a 300 urn nozzle diameter improved the repeatability of the bioprinting process by achieving consistent cell output over time using different human alveolar lung cells. The 3D bioprinted human triple-layered alveolar lung models were able to maintain cell viability with relative similar proliferation profile over time as compared to non-printed cells. This DOD 3D bioprinting platform offers an attractive tool for highly repeatable and scalable fabrication of 3D in-vitro human alveolar lung models. © 2021. Ng, et al.

In general, empirical orthogonal function (EOF) used to reduce the dimension in the ocean data and recently, Self-organizing maps (SOM) algorithm have been investigated to apply to the ocean field. In this study, both algorithms used the monthly Sea level anomaly (SLA) data from 1993 to 2018 around the East Asia Coasts. There was dominated by the influence of the Kuroshio Extension and eddy kinetic energy. It was able to find the maximum amount of variance of EOF modes. SOM algorithm summarized the characteristic of spatial distributions and periods in EOF mode 1 and 2. It was useful to find the change of SLA variable through the movement of nodes. Node 1 and 5 appeared in the early 2000s and the early 2010s when the sea level was high. On the other hand, node 2 and 6 appeared in the late 1990s and the late 2000s, when the sea level was relatively low. Therefore, it is considered that the application of the SOM algorithm around the East Asia Coasts is well distinguished. In addition, SOM results processed by SLA data, it is able to apply the other climate data to explain more clearly SLA variation mechanisms. © 2020 Korean Society of Remote Sensing.","Altimetry; Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF); Sea level change; Self-organizing Maps (SOM)","","","","","","","","Back S.-Y., Kim S.-W., Jung M.-I., Roh J.-W., Son S.-W., Classification of heat wave events in Seoul using self-organizing map, Journal of Climate Change Research, 9, 3, pp. 209-221, (2018); Bessieres L., Rio M.H., Dufau C., Boone C., Pujol M.I., Ocean state indicators from MyOcean altimeter products, Ocean Science, 9, 3, pp. 545-560, (2013); Cazenave A., Palanisamy H., Ablain M., Contemporary sea level changes from satellite altimetry: What have we learned?

Also, they provide the advantage of a short time to make the final parts, do not involve the need for auxiliary resources (cutting tools, lighting fixtures or coolants) and have a low impact on the environment. However, the aspects that make these technologies not yet widely used in industry are poor surface quality of parts, uncertainty about the mechanical properties of products and low productivity. Research on the physical phenomena associated with additive manufacturing processes is necessary for proper control of the phenomena of melting, solidification, vaporization and heat transfer. This paper addresses the relevant additive manufacturing processes and their applications and analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of AM processes compared to conventional production processes. For the aerospace industry, these technologies offer possibilities for manufacturing lighter structures to reduce weight, but improvements in precision must be sought to eliminate the need for finishing processes. © 2021.

First, a moving heat source model was established, and through numerical analysis and experimental comparison, the optimal geometric parameters of the heat source model for ultrathin blade repair were obtained. Second, a heat transfer model is established based on the optimal heat source model.By analyzing the thermophysical properties of different alloys, the heat input range of the blade was calculated. By heat transfer calculation under different heat inputs, the heat transfer model ofblade repair was optimized. Then, a mathematical model of additive height is established. The optimized heat transfer model is used to solve the temperature distribution of the additive section withtime under different wire feeding speeds through numerical analysis, which further reduced the heatinput range. Third, the experiments are carried out based on the results of numerical analysis. Theevolution law of the microstructure and heat input rate of the additive manufacturing zone was revealed, and the optimal heat input parameters were obtained. Under the optimal parameters, the segregation zone disappeared; hence, the test data were close to the base metal, and the additive manufacturing zone achieved better quality. The results and methods are of great guiding significance for the optimization design in additive manufacturing repair of the aero blades. The study also contributes to carrying out a series of research on heat transfer of ultrathin nickel-based alloy welding. © 2021 Shijie Dai et al.","","Additives; Heat transfer; Nickel alloys; Numerical analysis;

An objective function for optimizing the process planning parameters is proposed in which perimetral offsets for each layer are considered as a parameter in addition to the layer thickness. The root-mean-square (RMS) value of the deviations between the NURBS representation of the CAD model and its built-up simulation is suggested to estimate a quantitative measure for the uncertainties. The proposed approach eliminates the sophistication of the calculation cusp volume in 3D space and has more compatibility with the corresponding inspection processes. The developed methodology is introduced based on using a metaheuristic algorithm to find the optimal layer thicknesses and perimetral offsets for a built-up model. A data collecting approach is also introduced to reduce the computation time associated with the simulation of the build-up model at each iteration. The developed methodology potentially can be used for layer-based additive manufacturing processes. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptive slicing; additive manufacturing; cusp volume; direct slicing; geometric complexity; layer-based manufacturing; NURBS surface; volumetric deviations","Additives; Computer aided design; Iterative methods; Optimization; Uncertainty analysis; Additive manufacturing process; Computation time; Inspection process; Meta heuristic algorithm; Objective functions; Planning parameters; Quantitative measures; Root mean square values; 3D printers","","","","","","","Barari A., Kishawy H.A., Kaji F., Elbestawi M.A., On the Surface Quality of Additive Manufactured Parts, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 89, 5-8, pp. 1969-1974, (2017); Bonnard R., Hascoet J.Y., Mognol P., Data Model for Additive Manufacturing Digital Thread: State of the Art and Perspectives, International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing, 32, 12, pp. 1170-1191, (2019); Di Angelo L., Di Stefano P., Marzola A., Surface Quality Prediction in FDM Additive Manufacturing, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 93, 9-12, pp. 3655-3662, (2017); Dolenc A., Makela I., Slicing Procedures for Layered Manufacturing Techniques, Computer-Aided Design, 26, 2, pp. 119-126, (1994); Gohari H., Barari A., Kishawy H., Using Multistep Methods in Slicing 2 ½ Dimensional Parametric Surfaces for Additive Manufacturing Applications, IFAC-PapersOnLine, 49, 31, pp. 67-72, (2016); Gohari H., Barari A., Kishawy H., An Efficient Methodology for Slicing NURBS Surfaces Using Multi-step Methods, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 95, 9-12, pp. 3111-3125, (2018); Gohari H., Barari A., Producing High Precision Additive Manufacturing Parts by Direct Printing of NURBS Surfaces, 2020 IEEE 10Th International Conference Nanomaterials: Applications & Properties (NAP), (2020); Gohari H., Barari A., Kishawy H., Tsuzuki M.S.G., Intelligent Process Planning for Additive Manufacturing, IFAC-PapersOnLine, 52, 10, pp. 218-223, (2019); Hayasi M.T., Asiabanpour B., A New Adaptive Slicing Approach for the Fully Dense Freeform Fabrication (FDFF) Process, Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 24, 4, pp. 683-694, (2013); Jamiolahmadi S., Barari A., A Genetic Programming Approach to Model Detailed Surface Integrity of Additive Manufacturing Parts, IFAC-PapersOnLine, 48, 3, pp. 2339-2344, (2015); Jiang J., Xu X., Stringer J., Optimization of Process Planning for Reducing Material Waste in Extrusion Based Additive Manufacturing, Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, (2019); Jin Y., He Y., Du J., A Novel Path Planning Methodology for Extrusion-based Additive Manufacturing of Thin-walled Parts, International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing, 30, 12, pp. 1301-1315, (2017); Joneja A., Pang A., Lam D., Yuen M., A CAD/CAM System for Vector-based Layered Manufacturing Systems), International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing, 13, 5, pp. 388-400, (2000); Kaji F., Barari A., Evaluation of the Surface Roughness of Additive Manufacturing Parts Based on the Modelling of Cusp Geometry, IFAC-PapersOnLine, 48, 3, pp. 658-663, (2015); Kumar C., Choudhury A.R., Volume Deviation in Direct Slicing, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 11, 3, pp. 174-184, (2005); Lalehpour A., Barari A., Developing Skin Model in Coordinate Metrology Using a Finite Element Method, Measurment, 109, pp. 149-159, (2017); Lalehpour A., Barari A., A More Accurate Analytical Formulation of Surface Roughness in Layer-based Additive Manufacturing to Enhance the Product’s Precision, The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 96, 9-12, pp. 3793-3804, (2018); Li B., Fu J., Zhang Y.J., Lin W., Feng J., Shang C., Slicing Heterogeneous Solid Using Octree-based Subdivision and Trivariate T-splines for Additive Manufacturing, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 26, 1, pp. 164-175, (2020); Pandey P.M.P.M.P.M., Reddy N.V., Dhande S.G.S., Real Time Adaptive Slicing for Fused Deposition Modelling, International Journal of Machine Tools & Manufacture, 43, 1, pp. 61-71, (2003); Sikder S., Barari A., Kishawy H.A., Global Adaptive Slicing of NURBS Based Sculptured Surface for Minimum Texture Error in Rapid Prototyping, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 21, 6, pp. 649-661, (2015); Wang W.L., Conley J.G., Yan Y.N., Fuh J.Y.H., Towards Intelligent Setting of Process Parameters for Layered Manufacturing, Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 11, 1, pp. 65-74, (2000); Zhao D., Guo W., Mixed-layer Adaptive Slicing for Robotic Additive Manufacturing (AM) Based on Decomposing and Regrouping, Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 31, 4, pp. 985-1002, (2020); Zhou M.Y., Xi J.T., Yan J.Q., Adaptive Direct Slicing with Non-uniform Cusp Heights for Rapid Prototyping, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, (2004)","A.

Box 11365-11155, Tehran, Iran","The development of bioinks based on shear-thinning and self-healing hydrogels has recently attracted significant attention for constructing complex three-dimensional physiological microenvironments. For extrusion-based bioprinting, it is challenging to provide high structural reliability and resolution of printed structures while protecting cells from shear forces during printing. Herein, we present shear-thinning and printable hydrogels based on silicate nanomaterials, laponite (LA), and glycosaminoglycan nanoparticles (GAGNPs) for bioprinting applications. Nanocomposite hydrogels (GLgels) were rapidly formed within seconds due to the interactions between the negatively charged groups of GAGNPs and the edges of LA. The shear-thinning behavior of the hydrogel protected encapsulated cells from aggressive shear stresses during bioprinting. The bioinks could be printed straightforwardly into shape-persistent and free-standing structures with high aspect ratios. Rheological studies demonstrated fast recovery of GLgels over multiple strain cycles. In vitro studies confirmed the ability of GLgels to support cell growth, proliferation, and spreading. In vitro osteogenic differentiation of pre-osteoblasts murine bone marrow stromal cells encapsulated inside the GLgels was also demonstrated through evaluation of ALP activity and calcium deposition. The subcutaneous implantation of the GLgel in rats confirmed its in vivo biocompatibility and biodegradability. The engineered shear-thinning hydrogel with osteoinductive characteristics can be used as a new bioink for 3D printing of constructs for bone tissue engineering applications. © 2020","3D bioprinting; Biomimetic proteoglycan; Laponite; Nanocomposite; Osteoinductive bioink","Animals; Bioprinting; Hydrogels; Mice; Osteogenesis; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Rats; Reproducibility of Results; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; 3D printers; Aspect ratio; Biocompatibility; Biodegradability; Bone; Cell proliferation; Cells; Cytology; Hydrogels; Medical applications; Non Newtonian flow; Shear flow; Shear stress; Silicates; Tissue engineering; alkaline phosphatase; bioink; biomimetic material; calcium; glycosaminoglycan; ink; laponite; nanohydrogel; nanoparticle; proteoglycan; silicate; unclassified drug; Biomedical applications; Bone marrow stromal cells; Bone tissue engineering; Free-standing structures; Nanocomposite hydrogels; Osteogenic differentiation; Shear-thinning behavior; Structural reliability; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; biocompatibility; biodegradability; biomimetics; bone development; bone marrow stroma cell; bone tissue; cell differentiation; cell growth; cell proliferation; cell spreading; chemical interaction; controlled study; enzyme activity; flow kinetics; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; nanoencapsulation; nanoengineering; nonhuman; osteoblast; priority journal; rat; shear stress; three dimensional bioprinting; tissue engineering; animal; bioprinting; hydrogel; mouse; reproducibility; three dimensional printing; tissue scaffold; Shear thinning","","alkaline phosphatase, 9001-78-9; calcium, 7440-70-2, 14092-94-5; silicate, 12627-13-3; Hydrogels, ","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01EB023052); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI, (R01HL140618); National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI; American Heart Association, AHA, (16SDG31280010); American Heart Association, AHA; Sharif University of Technology, (QA970816); Sharif University of Technology; Iran National Science Foundation, INSF, (95-S-48740); Iran National Science Foundation, INSF","NA acknowledges the support from American Heart Association (AHA, 16SDG31280010 ), and National Institutes of Health (NIH) ( R01EB023052 ; R01HL140618 ).

To assess in vitro phenotypic changes, M1 and M2 polarised Type 2 diabetic rat (Goto Kakizaki, GK) macrophages were cultured on micro-rough (SLA) or hydrophilic nanostructured SLA (modSLA) titanium. The in vivo effects of the SLA and modSLA surfaces on macrophage phenotype, wound-associated protein expression and bone formation were investigated using a critical-sized calvarial defect model. Compared to healthy macrophages, GK M2 macrophage function was compromised, secreting significantly lower levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The modSLA surface attenuated the pro-inflammatory cellular environment, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine production and promoting M2 macrophage phenotype differentiation. ModSLA also suppressed gene expression associated with macrophage multinucleation and giant cell formation and stimulated pro-osteogenic genes in co-cultured osteoblasts. In vivo, modSLA enhanced osteogenesis compared to SLA in GK rats. During early healing, proteomic analysis of both surface adherent and wound exudate material showed that modSLA promoted an immunomodulatory pro-reparative environment. The modSLA surface therefore successfully compensated for the compromised M2 macrophage function in Type 2 diabetes by attenuating the pro-inflammatory response and promoting M2 macrophage activity, thus restoring macrophage homeostasis and resulting in a cellular environment favourable for enhanced osseous healing. © 2020","Diabetes; Immunomodulation; Macrophage phenotypes; Osseous healing; SLA/modSLA; Titanium surface modification","Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Homeostasis; Macrophages; Proteomics; Rats; Surface Properties; Titanium; Bone; Cellular manufacturing; Gene expression; Titanium; interleukin 10; titanium; Anti-inflammatories; Cellular environment; Cytokine production; Immuno modulations; Inflammatory response; Macrophage phenotypes; Protein expressions; Titanium surface modifications; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bone development; calvaria; cell activity; cell differentiation; coculture; controlled study; cytokine production; cytokine release; female; fracture healing; gene expression; giant cell; Goto Kakizaki rat; homeostasis; hydrophilicity; immunomodulation; in vitro study; in vivo study; macrophage; macrophage function; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; ossification; osteoblast; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression; proteomics; rat; Sprague Dawley rat; surface property; animal; homeostasis; macrophage; surface property; Macrophages","","titanium, 7440-32-6; Titanium, ","","","Australian Proteome Analysis Facility; Australian Dental Research Foundation, ADRF","Funding text 1: This research was partly supported by the Reginald and Pamela Hession Award conferred by the Australian Dental Research Foundation . Mass spectroscopy analysis was undertaken at Australian Proteome Analysis Facility (APAF), the infrastructure provided by the Australian Government through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS). The SEM images were enhanced by Professor B. Fournier and Ms Katherine Huh. ; Funding text 2: Macrophage phenotypic modulation by the modSLA surface was demonstrated in vitro where CD11c (M1) expression was reduced by 50% over 7 days of culture, while the CD163 (M2) expression was increased by 50%. Moreover, the immunomodulatory effects of the modSLA surface, where consistently lower levels of iNOS gene expression and higher Arg-1 gene expression were shown for both M1 and M2 macrophages, are in agreement with previous studies [ 11?13,22]. Compromised diabetic M2 macrophage function was further supported by the immunocytochemistry analysis which showed that CD163 expression (M2) was reduced by 50% at day 7, while CD11c expression (M1) was increased by 100% on the SLA surface when compared to healthy macrophages [14] where CD163 expression was stable during 7 days of culture. Taken together, this suggests diabetic M2 macrophages on SLA surface may be more prone to exhibit a pro-inflammatory phenotype, which could be modulated by the modSLA surface, promoting a re-establishment of homeostasis in macrophage phenotypes.This research was partly supported by the Reginald and Pamela Hession Award conferred by the Australian Dental Research Foundation.

Since the two parts are the main components that resist external forces, it is important to design the two parts for the FDM-manufactured structures. A tensile test specimen was the target shape in this work because the tensile test specimens have all of the components (top and bottom surfaces, side layer, and core lattice) of the FDM structure. In addition, tensile testing is a useful way to analyze mechanical properties. In order to study the effects of the parameters via the tensile test, specimens were designed with respect to the infill density, raster angle, and side layer thickness. An analytical model was then formulated to understand the measured data, and the presented model was found to have good agreement with the experimental results. The experimental and prediction results showed that the perimeter has a much stronger effect on the FDM structures than the core lattice, except for small raster angle conditions since the core part deforms with rotation mode at the joints, working as a plastic hinge in the core. Additional experiments with special specimens having no side layer also support the idea of a joint effect of the core part. The effects of the process parameters (infill density, raster angle, and perimeter thickness) are also discussed based on the model and experiments. The results indicate that the side layer should be well designed for FDM-manufactured structures to resist external forces. © 2020, Korean Society for Precision Engineering.","Analytic solution; Core lattice;

Currently, surface quality and mechanical properties of parts are limited by path planning algorithms. This study presents an algorithm for non-planar path planning with variable layer height, enabling the accurate representation of freeform surfaces and introducing the potential for increasing the parts’ mechanical properties by tailoring the layers to the load-case. By using mathematical functions to describe non-planar layers and calculating the amount of material to be extruded, layer thickness may vary inside the same layer, enabling transitions between different curved layers without introducing air gaps. In addition, means for selecting a beneficial nozzle geometry for non-planar additive manufacturing are presented. Finally, manufactured parts are evaluated, showing the benefits of the presented method. Specifically, it is shown that surface roughness can be reduced by 76% for curved top surfaces and indications for improved mechanical properties can be derived from performed tests. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Freeform; Load-case tailoring; Non-planar layers; Nozzle geometry; Path planning; Surface quality","Additives; Functions; Mechanical properties; Surface roughness; Additive manufacturing technology; Free-form surface; Layer by layer; Layer thickness; Mathematical functions; Nozzle geometries; Path-planning algorithm; Planar layers; 3D printers","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (390621612, EXC-2023)","The depicted research has been funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany’s Excellence Strategy – EXC-2023 Internet of Production – 390621612 .","(2019); Gibson I., Rosen D.W., Stucker B., Additive Manufacturing Technologies, (2010); Ngo T.D., Kashani A., Imbalzano G., Nguyen K.T.Q., Hui D., Additive manufacturing (3D printing): a review of materials, methods, applications and challenges, Compos.

However, limitations could arise due to artifacts, such as surface texture and/or roughness resulting from the manufacturing process. We have, therefore, adopted a parallel plate microwave resonator for the accurate measurement of the surface resistance of flat metal plates, allowing for microwave current flow in two orthogonal directions by simply exciting a different resonant mode (at 5.3 and 6.4 GHz), without the need to remove and refix the sample. The systematic and random errors associated with the measurement of surface resistance are very small, less than 1% and 0.1%, respectively. The technique is demonstrated with measurements on a range of samples of the alloys, AlSi10Mg and Ti6Al4V, manufactured by laser powder bed fusion, in addition to traditionally machined samples of bulk metal alloys of aluminum and brass. For AM samples of AlSi10Mg, we have studied the effect on the surface resistance of directional roughness features, generated by the laser raster paths, in directions transverse or parallel to microwave current flow. Importantly for passive microwave device applications, we demonstrate that these samples exhibit no systematic anisotropy of surface resistance associated with such surface features. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Additive manufacture; materials measurement; parallel plate; resonant cavity; surface resistance","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Magnesium alloys; Metals; Microwave devices; Microwave resonators; Microwaves; Plate metal; Random errors; Silicon; Silicon alloys; Surface roughness; Systematic errors; Ternary alloys; Textures; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Accurate measurement; Manufacturing process; Measurement techniques; Microwave surface resistance; Orthogonal directions; Parallel plates; Passive microwaves; Surface textures; Surface resistance","","","","","Renishaw; ; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/R511882/1)","Manuscript received June 23, 2020; revised August 24, 2020; accepted September 25, 2020.

However, conventional experimental measurements of the variation of cured thickness under UV light exposure for each individual photocurable material are extremely time-consuming and wasteful of material. In this current research, an analytical model based on differential analysis is developed to analytically obtain the relationship between UV light exposure time and the cured thickness of a single layer. In this model, the analytical Jacobs working curve can be described as depending only on three physical properties of photocurable materials: solid absorbance, liquid absorbance, and gelation time. Moreover, adjusting the concentration of UV absorber in the photocurable materials leads to a good agreement between the analytical Jacobs working curve and the experimental data. The analytical Jacobs working curves of polyethylene (glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogel and gelatin methacrylate (GelMA)/decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) bioink were utilized to predict DLP printing parameters, which were demonstrated to be accurate enough to print 3D complex structures, i.e., three periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS), a triangle cone, and a diamond grid overlaid spherical shell. This theoretical model of the DLP Jacobs working curve lays the foundations for appropriate DLP printing parameters, and in particular makes possible high-precision DLP printing of photocurable materials. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Absorbance; Digital light processing; Jacobs working curve; Photocurable material; UV absorber","Curing; Gelation; Optical materials; Differential analysis; Digital light processing; Experimental validations; Extracellular matrices; Periodic minimal surfaces; Photocurable materials; Theoretical modeling; UV light exposures; Light","","","","","Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province, (2017C01063); Key Research and Development Project of Zhejiang Province, (2018C03083); Zhejiang Clinical Research Center of Minimally Invasive Diagnosis and Treatment of Abdominal Diseases, (2018E50003); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52075482); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFA0703000); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This study was partially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2018YFA0703000 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52075482 ), the Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province (Grant No. 2017C01063 ), Zhejiang Clinical Research Center of Minimally Invasive Diagnosis and Treatment of Abdominal Diseases (Grant No. 2018E50003 ), the Key Research and Development Project of Zhejiang Province (Grant No. 2018C03083 ).

We analyzed the problem of the current cooling method in blade additive manufacturing repair. Based on cooling effect, we proposed an advanced flexible multiflow path fixture cooling method for blade additive manufacturing repair. We created a coupled heat transfer model and deduced the heat transfer law for multiflow path conjugate flexible clamping. We obtained the optimal cooling scheme for flexible multiflow paths through numerical analysis. We built an experimental platform and tested the cooling effect of the fixture prototype by experiment. The results show that compared with the current cooling method, the new cooling method not only can lower the initial temperature of the fixture rapidly and realize the steady-state heat transfer between the fixture and the flow path quickly but can also significantly enhance the ability of fluid to participate in heat transfer in new flow paths, which significantly improves the cooling effect. The research results are of great significance for the improvement of aero blade additive manufacturing repair.  © 2013 IEEE.","blade repair; Cooling method; flexible fixture; heat transfer; numerical analysis","Additives; Cooling; Fixed platforms; Fixtures (tooling); Industrial research; Cooling effects; Coupled heat transfer model; Experimental platform; Heat transfer laws; Initial temperatures; Optimal cooling; Research results; Steady-state heat transfer; 3D printers","","","","","Civil Aviation of China, (U1633104); Development of Local Science and Technology, (19941603G); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2019YFB1311100)","This work was supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2019YFB1311100, in part by the Special Fund for the Central Government to Guide the Development of Local Science and Technology under Grant 19941603G, and in part by the Joint Fund for Civil Aviation of China under Grant U1633104.","Miao G., Dai S., Jia P., Wang D., Heat transfer modeling and cooling method for aeroengine blade MPAW repair, Trans.

Firstly, an optimum process parameter set resulting in defect-free bonding of both materials has been predicted by carrying out a parametric study. Thereafter, microstructural and mechanical characterization such as optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, hardness and tensile testing have been carried out to investigate the characteristics of the bimetallic interface. The porosity quantification shows a density greater than 99.5% with no observable cracks or porosity at the transition zone. The secondary electron micrographs reveal a small inter-diffusion region at the interface. The interface and the nearby region consist of both cellular and columnar grains. The tensile strength of the bimetallic-structure approaches the strength of stainless steel 316 L. Even with the material discontinuity, the fracture happens at the weaker side (stainless steel 316 L) indicating the strong strength of the dissimilar interface. The fractography of the fractured surface displays a typical ductile cup and cone type of fracture. The results strongly suggest the suitability of the LPBF process for fabricating defect-free high-strength IN718-SS316L bimetallic structures. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.","ductile; failure; lasers; microstructure; porosity; Structures; tensile; xrd","Cracks; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Fracture; Fracture mechanics; Porosity; Scanning electron microscopy; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Bimetallic interfaces; Bimetallic structures; Dissimilar interfaces; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Material discontinuity; Mechanical characterizations; Secondary electrons; Stainless steel 316; Austenitic stainless steel","","","","","DST-FIST; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी, (DST/TDT/AMT/2017/118, SR/FST/ETII-066); Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी; Science and Engineering Research Board, SERB, (IMP/2018/000293); Science and Engineering Research Board, SERB","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of DST-FIST, Department of Science and Technology, India (Grant No. SR/FST/ETII-066), Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India (Grant No. DST/TDT/AMT/2017/118), and Science and Engineering Research Board, Department of Science and Technology, India (Grant No. IMP/2018/000293).

However, molten Ti is highly reactive with ceramic crucibles. Thus, only crucible-free techniques can be used, limiting the manufacturing. In this study, Ti–Y, CP-Titanium powder was manufactured using the vacuum induction gas atomization cold crucible (VIGA-CC) process, without using any master alloy; moreover, its properties were elucidated. Characterisations were performed to comparatively analyse the surface morphology, impurity content and mechanical properties of the synthesised powder. It was found that the powder had a uniform composition and was refined by the yttrium addition. The VIGA-CC process, by which alloy powders with various compositions can be prepared, is expected to expand the list of target alloys that can be used in additive manufacturing processes. © 2021 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining Published by Taylor & Francis on behalf of the Institute.","cold crucible; gas atomization; oxide dispersion strengthened alloys; titanium; VIGA","3D printers; Additives; Atomization; Binary alloys; Biocompatibility; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant alloys; Crucibles; High strength alloys; Morphology; Powders; Surface morphology; Additive manufacturing process; Ceramic Crucible; Cold crucibles; Comparative studies; Gas atomization; Impurity content; Micro-structural; Vacuum induction; Titanium alloys","","","","","Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE, (20001221, JE210006); Korea Institute of Industrial Technology, KITECH, (UR200013)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Industrial Strategic Technology Development Program-Development of Material Component Technology (20001221, ‘Development of high strength and fatigue resistance metal and manufacturing technology for root analogue dental implants’).

The Archimedes’ method was used to measure the apparent and closed porosities. Apparent (open) porosity and closed porosity were found to follow different trends: the apparent porosity increased but the closed porosity decreased as hatch distance or point distance increased. The open pores are attributed to the lack of fusion at the large hatch distance or point distance while the closed pores are attributed to the possible spattering and keyhole formation at the smaller hatch distance or point distance. The results led to understanding the effects of hatch distance and point distance on the formation of open and closed pores and provided insight on the optimization of process parameters to further increase the relative bulk density. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Pore; Selective laser melting; Tungsten","Hatches; Melting; Pore size; Tungsten; Apparent porosity; Closed pore; Open pores; Optimization of process parameters; Point distances; Pore formation; Relative bulk density; Selective laser melting","","","","","Texas A and M University, TAMU","This material is based upon work supported by the T3 program of Texas A&M University .","Deprez K., Vandenberghe S., van Audenhaege K., van Vaerenbergh J., Et al., Rapid additive manufacturing of MR compatible multipinhole collimators with selective laser melting of tungsten powder, Med Phys, 40, 1, (2013); Gu D., Dai D., Chen W., Chen H., Selective laser melting additive manufacturing of hard-to-process tungsten-based alloy parts with novel crystalline growth morphology and enhanced performance, J Manuf Sci Eng Trans ASME, 138, 8, (2016); Wang X., Wraith M., Burke S., Rathbun H., DeVlugt K., Densification of W-Ni-Fe powders using laser sintering, Int J Refract Metals Hard Mater, 56, pp. 145-150, (2016); Enneti R.K., Morgan R., Atre S.V., Effect of process parameters on the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) of tungsten, Int J Refract Metals Hard Mater, 71, pp. 315-319, (2018); Wang L., Wu J., Zhang D., Properties evolution of additive manufacture used tungsten powders prepared by radio frequency induction plasma, Int J Refract Metals Hard Mater, 67, pp. 90-97, (2017); Wang D., Yu C., Zhou X., Ma J., Liu W., Shen Z., Dense pure tungsten fabricated by selective laser melting, Appl Sci, 7, 4, (2017); Nie B., Yang L., Huang H., Bai S., Wan P., Liu J., Femtosecond laser additive manufacturing of iron and tungsten parts, Appl Phys A Mater Sci Process, 119, 3, pp. 1075-1080, (2015); Bai S., Liu J., Yang P., Zhai M., Huang H., Yang L., Femtosecond fiber laser additive manufacturing of tungsten. laser 3D manufacturing III, 9738, (2016); ISO, Fine ceramics (advanced ceramics, advanced technical ceramics)-Determination of density and apparent porosity, (2013); King W.E., Barth H.D., Castillo V.M., Gallegos G.F., Gibbs J.W., Hahn D.E., Et al., Observation of keyhole-mode laser melting in laser powder-bed fusion additive manufacturing, J Mater Process Technol, 214, 12, pp. 2915-2925, (2014); Rombouts M., Kruth J.P., Froyen L., Mercelis P., Fundamentals of Selective Laser Melting of alloyed steel powders, CIRP Ann Manuf Technol, 55, 1, pp. 187-192, (2006); Aboulkhair N.T., Everitt N.M., Ashcroft I., Tuck C., Reducing porosity in AlSi10Mg parts processed by selective laser melting, Addit Manuf, 1, pp. 77-86, (2014); Weingarten C., Buchbinder D., Pirch N., Meiners W., Wissenbach K., Poprawe R., Formation and reduction of hydrogen porosity during selective laser melting of AlSi10Mg, J Mater Process Technol, 221, pp. 112-120, (2015); Qiu C., Panwisawas C., Ward M., Basoalto H.C., Brooks J.W., Attallah M.M., On the role of melt flow into the surface structure and porosity development during selective laser melting, Acta Mater, 96, pp. 72-79, (2015); Spierings A.B., Herres N., Levy G., Influence of the particle size distribution on surface quality and mechanical properties in AM steel parts, Rapid Prototyp J, 17, pp. 195-202, (2011); Leonard F., Tammas-Williams S., Prangnell P.B., Todd I., Withers P.J., Assessment by X-ray CT of the effects of geometry and build direction on defects in titanium ALM parts, Conference on Industrial Computed Tomography (ICT), pp. 19-21, (2012); Gong H., Gu H., Zeng K., Dilip J.J.S., Pal D., Stucker B., Et al., Melt pool characterization for selective laser melting of Ti-6Al-4V pre-alloyed powder, Solid Freeform Fabr Symp Proc, pp. 256-267, (2014); Leung C.L.A., Marussi S., Towrie M., Atwood R.C., Withers P.J., Lee P.D., The effect of powder oxidation on defect formation in laser additive manufacturing, Acta Mater, 166, pp. 294-305, (2019); Braun J., Kaserer L., Stajkovic J., Leitz K.H., Tabernig B., Singer P., Et al., Molybdenum and tungsten manufactured by selective laser melting: analysis of defect structure and solidification mechanisms, Int J Refract Metals Hard Mater, 84, (2019); Wang D., Wang Z., Li K., Ma J., Liu W., Shen Z., Cracking in laser additively manufactured W: initiation mechanism and a suppression approach by alloying, Mater Des, 162, pp. 384-393, (2019); Hall E.O., The deformation and ageing of mild steel: III discussion of results, Proc Phys Soc Sec B, 64, 9, (1951); Petch N.J., The Cleavage strength of polycrystals, J Iron Steel Inst, 174, (1953); Ashby M.F., Jones D.R.H., Strengthening methods and plasticity of polycrystals.

It may be considered for 5G networks. However, the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is viewed as a significant disadvantage of a NOMA waveform, and it weakens the quality of signals and the throughput of the scheme. In this article, we introduce a modified NOMA system by employing a block of wavelet transform, an alternative to FFT (Fast Fourier transform). The modified system combines the details of fractional frequency and time analysis of NOMA signals. In this correspondence, we utilize an advanced partial transmission scheme (PTS), and selective mapping (SLM), and present a genetic algorithm (GA) for SLM to investigate the peak power performance of a WT-based NOMA system. The performance of WT-SLM, WT-PTS, and WT-SLM-GA methods is compared with that of the traditional NOMA-based SLM and PTS methods. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system effectively reduces PAPR in comparison with the traditional schemes. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

The samples have been cut in various directions to analyze their phases, grain morphology, size, crystallographic orientation, and distribution of elements via X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) in a transmission electron microscope (TEM). To monitor deformation behavior and strain distribution, several uniaxial tensile tests accompanied by digital image correlation (DIC) technique were carried out. The results showed that the as-built microstructure fully contains fine equiaxed grains with no strong preferential crystallographic orientation. The XEDS elemental maps confirmed the solute trapping phenomenon taking place during the LPBF. The stress-strain curves obtained by the uniaxial tensile testing revealed a quasi-isotropic behavior in terms of building direction; moreover, the DIC strain contour maps confirmed yield-point phenomenon and Lüders bands propagation during uniaxial tensile testing. Finally, a time/temperature interdependence grain growth model was successfully applied based on no diffusion in solid and partial mixing in liquid through the entire melt pool. © 2020","A205 alloy; Digital Image Correlation (DIC); Growth restriction factor (Q); Interdependence model; Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF)","Aluminum alloys; Copper alloys; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Grain growth; Magnesium alloys; Materials testing apparatus; Morphology; Powder metals; Stress-strain curves; Tensile testing; Textures; Titanium alloys; Transmission electron microscopy; Crystallographic orientations; D. digital image correlation (DIC); Distribution of element; Electron back scatter diffraction; Solidification behaviors; Uniaxial tensile test; Uniaxial tensile testing; X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy; Silver alloys","","","","","Office of Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, EPSCoR; Mitacs, (IT10669); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (RGPIN-2016-04221); New Brunswick Innovation Foundation, NBIF, (RIF2017-071); Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, ACOA, (210414)","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) grant number RGPIN-2016-04221 , New Brunswick Innovation Foundation (NBIF) grant number RIF2017-071 , Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA)- Atlantic Innovation Fund (AIF) project number 210414 , Mitacs Accelerate Program grant number IT10669 for providing sufficient funding are highly acknowledged.

Fused-deposition modeling was performed with a thermoplastic elastomer as the 3D printing material. The experimental design of the Taguchi L9(34) orthogonal arrays was used for the parameter design. To assess quality, the hardness was measured, with a focus on the smaller-the-better characteristic of the average hardness. The experimental results showed that the optimal combination of the structural hardness parameters is A1B3C1D1. As per the A scale, the average Shore hardness of the experimental model was 41.9. The signal-to-noise ratio of the experimental sample was −32.4526 dB, which is within the confidence interval, indicating that the factor effect has a reproduction characteristic that represents the reliability of this experimental result. The original material’s Shore hardness was reduced by 44.95%, from 85 A to 46.79 A, which represents an effective improvement in wearability. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","3D printing; colostomy bag base plate; design of experiment; fused-deposition modeling; Imperforate anus; thermoplastic elastomer","Cell proliferation; Fused Deposition Modeling; Hardness; Signal to noise ratio; 3-D printing; Confidence interval; Experimental modeling; Optimal combination; Orthogonal array; Parameter designs; Shore hardness; Smaller-the-better characteristics; Design of experiments","","","","","Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, KSVGH, (T1097807)","This work was supported by the Taichung Veterans General Hospital [T1097807].","Dobkin K.A., Broadwell D.C., Nursing consideration for the patient undergoing colostomy surgery, Semin Oncol Nurs, 2, 4, pp. 249-255, (1986); White M., Gough C., Howie A., Using silicone technology to maintain healthy skin in stoma care, Br J Nurs, 23, 22, pp. 1188-1193, (2014); Francielle P.R.; Colostomy and ileostomy, (2012); Healthwise incorporated [online image, (2010); American cancer society cancer.org |; Peter H., Brett T., Custom fit 3D printed ostomy wafers: is this the future for ostomates, (2016); Kruse T.M., Storling Z.M., Considering the benefits of a new stoma appliance: a clinical trial, Br J Nurs, 24, 22, pp. S12-S18, (2015); Swan E., Colostomy, management and quality of life for the patient, Br J Nurs, 20, 1, pp. 22-28, (2011); Tominaga T., Takagi K., Takeshita H., Et al., Usefulness of three-dimensional printing models for patients with stoma construction, Case Rep Gastroenterol, 10, 1, pp. 57-62, (2016); Grimm T.A., Fused deposition modeling: a technology evaluation, Time- Compression Technologies, (2003); Panda S.K., Padhee S., Sood A.K., Et al., Optimization of fused deposition modelling (FDM) process parameters using bacterial foraging technique, Intell Inf Manage, 1, 2, pp. 89-97, (2009); Percoco G., Lavecchia F., Galantucci L.M., Compressive properties of FDM rapid prototypes treated with a low cost chemical finishing, Res J Appl Sci Eng Technol, 4, 19, pp. 3838-3842, (2012); Onwubolu G.C., Rayegani F., Characterization and optimization of mechanical properties of ABS parts manufactured by the fused deposition modelling process, Int J Manuf Eng, (2014); Nidagundi V.B., Keshavamurthy R., Prakash C.P.S., Studies on parametric optimization for fused deposition modelling process, Mater Today Proc, 2, 4-5, pp. 1691-1699, (2015); Mohamed O.A., Masood S.H., Bhowmik J.L., Optimization of fused deposition modeling process parameters for dimensional accuracy using I-optimality criterion, Measurement, 81, pp. 174-196, (2016); Singh R., Trivedi A., Singh S., Experimental investigation on shore hardness of barrel-finished FDM patterns, Sādhanā, 42, 9, pp. 1579-1584, (2017); Taguchi G., Phadke M.S., Quality engineering through design optimization. quality control, robust design, and the taguchi method, pp. 77-96, (1989); Vn P., Kadia K.P., Parametric optimization of the process of fused deposition modeling in rapid prototyping technology-a review, Int J Innovative Res Sci Technol, 1, 7, pp. 80-82, (2014); Standard test method for rubber property durometer hardness, american society for testing and material, (2002); Anitha R., Arunachalam S., Radhakrishnan P., Critical parameters influencing the quality of prototypes in fused deposition modelling, J Mater Process Technol, 118, 1-3, pp. 385-388, (2001)","C.H.

In addition to detecting layer internal defects, layer imaging offers the possibility to retrieve the outer contours of a layer and thus three-dimensionally reconstruct the side walls of a part by vertically stacking contours belonging to sequential layers. The current open challenges for layer imaging relate to the compromise between imaging resolution and extension of covered area, and to the complexity of image interpretation, exacerbated by optically difficult materials, complex filament patterns and non-uniform environmental conditions. In this work we propose an original optical imaging solution for layer contour identification and stacking. Our solution overcomes the current challenges related to range/resolution and image interpretation by making use of digital twins, i.e. geometric simulations of the layer, based on the current manufacturing process parameters. Thanks to the use of digital twins, our vision system is able to: use high-resolution imaging only where it is needed, by following the predicted positions of the layer contours while acquiring a sequence of images; algorithmically interpret each image by concentrating only on interesting regions as suggested by the simulated prediction, thus reducing the risk for false positives; and finally monitor contour quality by performing a more accurate comparison between the measurement and a reference contour obtained by a simulation which replicates the actual fingerprint of the process, as opposed to simply relying on the edge obtained by slicing the CAD model. The in-process monitoring capability of the computer vision system is demonstrated through the fabrication of acceptable and defected instances of a test geometry. Fabrication issues are effectively and efficiently detected by the system and alarms are triggered that can be used to command early termination of the build process or to initiate corrective actions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Computer Vision; Fused Filament Fabrication; Material extrusion; Process monitoring and control","Computer aided design; Computer aided software engineering; Defects; Digital twin; Fabrication; Geometry; Image analysis; Imaging techniques; Optical image storage; Process control; Process monitoring; Risk assessment; Computer vision system; Environmental conditions; Geometric simulation; High-resolution imaging; Image interpretation; In-process monitoring; Manufacturing process parameters; Optical imaging solution; Computer vision","","","","","","","Hockaday L.A., Et al., Rapid 3D printing of anatomically accurate and mechanically heterogeneous aortic valve hydrogel scaffolds, Biofabrication, 4, 3, (2012); Gbureck U., Vorndran E., Muller F.A., Barralet J.E., Low temperature direct 3D printed bioceramics and biocomposites as drug release matrices, J.

Visualizing the extracted data for real-time solutions is demanding in accordance with the semantics and the classification employed by the processing models. This article introduces fuzzy-optimized data management (FDM) technique for classifying and improving coalition of accumulated information based semantics and constraints. The dependency of the information is classified on the basis of the relationships modeled between the data based on the attributes. This technique segregates the considered attributes based on similarity index boundaries to process complex data in a controlled time. The performance of the proposed FDM is analyzed using a real-time weather forecast dataset consisting of sensor data (observed) and image data (captured). With this dataset, the functions of FDM such as input semantics analytics and classification based on similarity are performed. The metrics classification and processing time and similarity index are analyzed for the varying data sizes, classification instances, and dataset records. The proposed FDM is found to achieve 36.28% less processing time for varying classification instances, and 12.57% high similarity index.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Attribute analysis; big data; data classification; fuzzy systems; input semantics","Advanced Analytics; Big data; Data Analytics; Data handling; Data mining; Frequency division multiplexing; Information management; Semantics; Weather forecasting; Complex architectures; Complex data; Data management techniques; Processing model; Processing time; Real time solution; Sensor data; Similarity indices; Classification (of information)","","","","","","","Lin D., Lu C., Jia J., RSCM: Region selection and concurrency model for multi-class weather recognition, IEEE Trans.

The high surface roughness and the comparatively low-dimensional accuracy of such components, however, usually require a finishing by a subtractive process such as milling or grinding in order to meet the requirements of the application. Materials manufactured via L-PBF are characterized by a unique microstructure and anisotropic material properties. These specific properties could also affect the subtractive processes themselves. In this paper, the effect of L-PBF on the machinability of the aluminum alloy AlSi10Mg is explored when milling. The chips, the process forces, the surface morphology, the microhardness, and the burr formation are analyzed in dependence on the manufacturing parameter settings used for L-PBF and the direction of feed motion of the end mill relative to the build-up direction of the parts. The results are compared with a conventionally cast AlSi10Mg. The analysis shows that L-PBF influences the machinability. Differences between the reference and the L-PBF AlSi10Mg were observed in the chip form, the process forces, the surface morphology, and the burr formation. The initial manufacturing method of the part thus needs to be considered during the design of the finishing process to achieve suitable results. © 2020, The Author(s).","Burr formation; Laser-based powder bed fusion; Machinability; Milling; Surface integrity; Surface quality","Aluminum alloys; Machinability; Manufacture; Milling (machining); Silicon; Surface morphology; Surface roughness; Anisotropic material properties; Conventionally casts; Finishing process; Low dimensional; Manufacturing methods; Manufacturing parameters; Metallic component; Specific properties; Morphology","","","","","Technische Universität Kaiserslautern, TU KL","Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

Here, a tissue-specific hybrid bioink is described, composed of a natural polymer, alginate, reinforced with extracellular matrix derived from decellularized tissue (rECM). rECM has rheological and gelation properties beneficial for 3D bioprinting while retaining biologically inductive properties supporting tissue maturation ex vivo and in vivo. These bioinks are shear thinning, resist cell sedimentation, improve viability of multiple cell types, and enhance mechanical stability in hydrogels derived from them. 3D printed constructs generated from rECM bioinks suppress the foreign body response, are pro-angiogenic and support recipient-derived de novo blood vessel formation across the entire graft thickness in a murine model of transplant immunosuppression. Their proof-of-principle for generating human tissue is demonstrated by 3D bioprinting human airways composed of regionally specified primary human airway epithelial progenitor and smooth muscle cells. Airway lumens remained patent with viable cells for one month in vitro with evidence of differentiation into mature epithelial cell types found in native human airways. rECM bioinks are a promising new approach for generating functional human tissue using 3D bioprinting. © 2020 The Authors.

The reason lies in the high dynamics taking place during the interaction of the laser with metallic powders. To bring this technology to mass production, industries are only interested in the process regime where the built layer's quality meets their standards. All other process regimes leading to poor mechanical properties and/or defect formation such as balling, Lack of Fusion (LoF) pores, keyhole pores, delamination, and crack propagation irrespective of their different regimes are considered anomalies. Today, the common methodology for monitoring uses conventional/supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for the classification task. However, it requires collecting a balanced dataset corresponding to each investigated regime from the sensors, which is very expensive and time-consuming. As an alternative, the article proposes a semi-supervised approach where the defect-free regime can be differentiated from the anomalies by familiarising the ML algorithms only with the distribution of acoustic signatures corresponding to the defect-free regime. This work presents two generative Convolutional Neural Network architectures based on Variational Auto-Encoder and General Adversarial Network. As a result, we could classify the anomaly regimes with 96 and 97% accuracy, respectively. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","acoustic emission; Convolutional Neural Network; Laser powder bed fusion; laser processing; monitoring","Backpropagation; Convolutional neural networks; Defects; Learning systems; Network architecture; Powder metals; Acoustic signature; Adversarial networks; Classification tasks; Defect formation; Mass production; Metallic powder; Quality monitoring; Semi-supervised; Acoustic emission testing","","","","","Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich, ETH","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the project MoCont from the programme of the Strategic Focus Area Advanced Manufacturing (SFA-AM), a strategic initiative of the ETH Board.

The objective functions are, respectively, to minimize the compliance of continuum structures under static loads and maximize the fundamental natural frequency of vibrating continuum structures. The topology optimization is performed by the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) method. The sensitivity expressions for minimizing the compliance or maximizing the fundamental natural frequency are derived in detail. Different thin feature constraints and the support structure constraints in different printing directions are investigated. Several two- and three-dimensional numerical examples involving compliance minimization and eigenfrequency maximization show that the proposed method is effective in achieving convergent solid–void optimized solutions for a variety of optimization problems of continuum structures, and the designs resulting from the new topology optimization algorithm are additive manufacturing friendly. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","additive manufacturing; manufacturability; support structure; thin feature; Topology optimization","3D printers; Additives; Ground supports; Natural frequencies; Numerical methods; Shape optimization; Topology; Additive manufacturing process; Bi-directional evolutionary structural optimizations; Compliance minimization; Continuum structures; Optimization algorithms; Optimization problems; Sensitivity expressions; Topological optimization; Structural optimization","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11872311)","This work was sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [11872311].

Design/methodology/approach: Two experimental studies were used, and samples with a flat vs upright print orientation were compared. The first experiment investigates a scan of printing parameters and annealing times and temperatures above the cold crystallization temperature (Tcc) for PLA. The second experiment investigates annealing above and below Tcc at multiple points over 12 h. Findings: Annealing above Tcc does not significantly impact the porosity but it does increase crystallinity. The increase in crystallinity does not contribute to an increase in strength, suggesting that co-crystallization across the weld does not occur. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images show that weld interfaces between printed fibers are still visible after annealing above Tcc, confirming the lack of co-crystallization. Annealing below Tcc does not significantly impact porosity or crystallinity. However, there is an increase in tensile strength. AFM images show that annealing below Tcc reduces thermal stresses that form at the interfaces during printing and slightly “heals” the as-printed interface resulting in an increase in tensile strength. Originality/value: While annealing has been explored in the literature, it is unclear how it affects porosity, crystallinity and thermal stresses in fused filament fabrication PLA and how those factors contribute to mechanical properties. This study explains how co-crystallization across weld interfaces is necessary for crystallinity to increase strength and uses AFM as a technique to observe morphology at the weld. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Fused deposition modeling; Microstructure; Post-processing; Tensile strength","Annealing; Atomic force microscopy; Crystallinity; Polyesters; Porosity; Tensile strength; Thermal stress; Welds; Co-crystallizations; Cold crystallization temperature; Design/methodology/approach; Interlayer adhesion; Multiple points; Poly lactic acid; Printed materials; Structural characteristics; 3D printers","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (BCS-1734981, ECCS-2025064); National Science Foundation, NSF; Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA9550-14-1-0032-P00003); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR; Duke University, (291-0067); Duke University","AFOSR FA9550-14-1-0032-P00003, NSF BCS-1734981, Duke University Grant/Award Number: 291-0067.

To date, this was mainly explored for extra-terrestrial construction. To promote geomaterial reconstitution in architecture, the paper presents a workflow and methods for additive manufacturing, explored using desert soil and a robotic tool. The workflow provides the steps for linking site, material, design, and fabrication, including the robotic setup, simulation, and technical analysis. The paper explores three methods: continuous, discrete, and a method termed here multimode additive. These methods are demonstrated through experiments detailing their design and fabrication processes, and the paper concludes with their comparative analysis. The research expands additive manufacturing with earthen materials, and the outcomes indicate a potential for combining computational design, robotic fabrication, and manual assembly. The paper also clarifies and expands existing terminology regarding part-to-whole relationships in on-site robotic fabrication, promoting resource-conscious, site-tailored additive manufacturing in architecture. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","additive manufacturing; Computational design; earthen construction materials; geomaterial reconstitution; multimode robotic production; robotic fabrication","3D printers; Additives; Architecture; Fabrication; Industrial research; Robotic assembly; Robotics; Comparative analysis; Computational design; Direct modulation; Fabrication process; Manual assembly; Robotic construction; Robotic fabrications; Technical analysis; End effectors","","","","","Azrieli Foundation; Technion-Israel Institute of Technology","The presented experiments draw upon the research in the studio ‘From Geomaterials to Architectural Structures,’ 2019/2020 conducted at the Material Topology Research Lab (MTRL), Technion-IIT.

Currently, its mesh-type titanium structure is additively manufactured using laser beam powder bed fusion (L-PBF). Nevertheless, an electron-beam (E-PBF) process could potentially be more time efficient. This study aimed to compare the geometrical accuracy and mechanical response of thin titanium structures manufactured by L-PBF (HIPed) and E-PBF (as-printed). Tensile test (ø = 1.2 mm) and implant specimens were manufactured. Measurements by μCT revealed a deviation in cross-sectional area as compared to the designed geometry: 13–35% for E-PBF and below 2% for L-PBF. A superior mechanical strength was obtained for the L-PBF specimens, both in the tensile test and the implant compression tests. The global peak load in the implant test was 457 ± 9 N and 846 ± 40 N for E-PBF and L-PBF, respectively. Numerical simulations demonstrated that geometrical deviation was the main factor in implant performance and enabled quantification of this effect: 34–39% reduction in initial peak force based on geometry, and only 11–16% reduction based on the material input. In summary, the study reveals an uncertainty in accuracy when structures of sizes relevant to mesh-type cranial implants are printed by the E-PBF method. © 2020 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Cranial implant; Electron beam melting; Finite element models; Powder bed fusion; Surface roughness","Additives; Calcium phosphate; Compression testing; Laser beams; Mesh generation; Tensile testing; Cranial implants; Cross sectional area; Geometrical accuracy; Geometrical deviations; Mechanical response; Patient specific; Time-efficient; Titanium structure; Titanium compounds","","","","","Sweden's Innovation Agency VINNOVA, (2019-00029); Horizon 2020, (E19741)","Funding from the Eurostars-2 Joint European Union‘s Horizon 2020 ( E19741 ) and support from Sweden's Innovation Agency VINNOVA ( AddLife Competence Centre , 2019-00029 ) are gratefully acknowledged.","Lowther M., Et al., Clinical, industrial, and research perspectives on powder bed fusion additively manufactured metal implants, Additive Manufacturing, 28, pp. 565-584, (2019); Zegers T., ter Laak-Poort M., Koper D., Lethaus B., Kessler P., The therapeutic effect of patient-specific implants in cranioplasty, J.

In each transmit antenna, both real and imaginary parts of the base-band data symbol were modified independently using a corresponding phase element within a commonly generated phase vector, instead of modifying the complex data symbol as a single component. After applying an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) for the real, imaginary, and original base-band vectors, the minimum PAPR component was observed. Therefore, the phase vector that introduced the minimal PAPR was considered to convert the original data block for transmission. This technique is called the In-phase/Quadrature-SLM (IQ-SLM) scheme. In this proposal, only U phase vectors were generated to treat all Nt data blocks, simultaneously, unlike the conventional MIMO-SLM techniques which generate UNt candidate phase blocks. The thing which, in turn, can be considered as a further computational complexity reduction, specifically in data-phase conversion stages. As a result, in terms of the complementary cumulative distribution function of PAPR performance(CCDF-PAPR), the proposal achieved a greater decibel reduction than conventional SLM methods such as dSLM, oSLM, and sSLM, at different subcarrier lengths N, candidate phase vectors U, transmit antennas Nt. Also, it shows a comparable BER performances over the dSLM scheme referencing to the theoretical curves, in the case where Nt Nr for both zero-forcing (ZF) and ZF with vertical Bell laboratories layered space-Time (V-BLAST) detector. © 2021 University of Split.

That knowledge, along with a review of existing speed limit setting practices, was used to develop a Speed Limit Setting Procedure (SLS-Procedure) as well as a user manual to explain the SLS-Procedure. In addition, the SLS-Procedure was automated via a spreadsheet-based Speed Limit Setting Tool (SLS-Tool). These products will permit engineers to make informed decisions about the setting of speed limits. The SLS-Procedure is fact based and transparent, relying on a set of decision rules that consider both driver speed choice and safety associated with the roadway. The SLS-Procedure was designed to be applicable across different roadway types and contexts by having a set of unique decision rules for four combinations of roadway types and contexts: limited-access, undeveloped, developed, and full-access facilities. The SLS-Procedure uses the operating speed distribution as a starting point for the suggested speed limit, with the resulting suggested value based on consideration of roadway type, context, safety performance, and other characteristics. © National Academy of Sciences.","","Decision rules; Informed decision; Limit setting; National Cooperative Highway Research Program; Operating speed; Roadway characteristics; Speed characteristics; Speed limit; Suburban streets; User manual; Speed","","","","","NCHRP, (17-76)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was sponsored by NCHRP as part of NCHRP Project 17-76.","Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways, FHWA, U.S. Department of Transportation, (2009); Stamatiadis N., Kirk A., Hartman D., Jasper J., Wright S., King M., Chellman R., NCHRP Report, 855, (2017); Multi-Modal Urban Transportation, (2017); Reducing Speeding-Related Crashes Involving Passenger Vehicles.

To provide personalized service access to consumers, a novel Automated Dynamic SLA Negotiation Framework (ADSLANF) is proposed using a dynamic SLA concept to negotiate on service terms and conditions. The existing frameworks exploit a direct negotiation mechanism where the provider and consumer can directly talk to each other, which may not be applicable in the future due to increasing demand on broker-based models. The proposed ADSLANF will take very less total negotiation time due to complicated negotiation mechanisms using a third-party broker agent. Also, a novel game theory decision system will suggest an optimal solution to the negotiating agent at the time of generating a proposal or counter proposal. This optimal suggestion will make the negotiating party aware of the optimal acceptance range of the proposal and avoid the negotiation break off by quickly reaching an agreement.  © 2021 - IOS Press.

The low printing resolution (400 μm) and various printing angles from 0° to 90° were employed to print the mold for casting of polymer surfaces. The polymer surface cast from the mold exhibited waveform microstructures that had a tilting angle almost identical to the printing angle. The maximum average water contact angle (WCA) of fabricated polymer surfaces was 160°, which is much higher than that of flat (bare) polymer surfaces (up to 52.3% increase in the WCA). In particular, water droplets immediately rolled off along 8°-tilted surfaces, cast from the mold printed with printing angle of 70°. This demonstrated the superhydrophobic property. The result of this study shows the feasibility of a facile, rapid, inexpensive, and effective microfabrication of superhydrophobic surfaces using the current 3D printing technology. © 2019, Korean Society for Precision Engineering.","3D printing;

Unskilled and painless applications of microneedle patches for blood collection or drug delivery are two of the advantages of microneedle arrays over hypodermic needles. Developing the necessary microneedle fabrication processes has the potential to dramatically impact the health care delivery system by changing the landscape of fluid sampling and subcutaneous drug delivery. Microneedle designs which range from sub-micron to millimetre feature sizes are fabricated using the tools of the microelectronics industry from metals, silicon, and polymers. Various types of subtractive and additive manufacturing processes have been used to manufacture microneedles, but the development of microneedle-based systems using conventional subtractive methods has been constrained by the limitations and high cost of microfabrication technology. Additive manufacturing processes such as 3D printing and two-photon polymerization fabrication are promising transformative technologies developed in recent years. The present article provides an overview of microneedle systems applications, designs, material selection, and manufacturing methods. © 2021 Faraji Rad et al.; licensee Beilstein-Institut.

Whereas most previous efforts focused on developing new printing or material systems, we propose a new voxel design strategy of constructing digital materials to provide the additively manufactured polymeric structures with spatially customized thermomechanical properties. In our approach, a matrix-inclusion composite layout is adopted in the linearly patterned voxels that perform as building blocks to construct bulk material. Through rational design of voxel size and inclusion content, the printed polymeric digital material displays a tunable storage modulus up to three orders of magnitude and glass transition temperature ranging from 0 °C to 60 °C. By taking advantage of the design freedom, we demonstrate a sequential folding structure with spatially tunable actuation speed, and multi-stable configurations that trap elastic energy in deterministic collapse sequences. Overall, our approach provides an effective and convenient way of spatially customizing material properties for additive manufacturing and offers instructive inspirations to the realm of digital fabrication. © 2020 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Digital material; Multi-material; Thermomechanical property; Voxel design","Additives; Glass transition; Polymers; Complex geometries; Digital fabrication; Folding structures; Functional structure; Matrix-inclusion composites; Polymeric structures; Thermomechanical properties; Three orders of magnitude; 3D printers","","","","","Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, (RGDM1710205, RGDM1830206, RGDM1830501); Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT; Centers for Mechanical Engineering Research and Education, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11802233); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Digital Manufacturing and Design Centre, Singapore University of Technology and Design, DMAND, SUTD; Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2020B090923003); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province","Q.G. acknowledges the Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province (Grant No.: 2020B090923003), and the support by the Centers for Mechanical Engineering Research and Education at MIT and SUSTech.

The porosity of the PLA scaffolds ranged from 86% to 90%. The structural anisotropy value of the scaffolds was 3.80, 2.00, and 1.04 for G2, G25, and G3, respectively. Compressive test results indicated that both the dense PLA and porous PLA scaffolds showed elastic-plastic deformation behavior in both building and transverse directions. The compressive elastic modulus and yield strength of the scaffolds were 118–180 ​MPa and 2–8 ​MPa in the building direction and 106–138 ​MPa and 2.5–6.0 ​MPa in the transverse direction, respectively. The tensile elastic modulus and yield strength were 51–63 ​MPa and 1.5–4.5 ​MPa in the building direction and 11–17 ​MPa and 1–5 ​MPa in the transverse direction, respectively. The gyroid PLA scaffolds showed significantly higher values for compressive strength (up to three times) compared to other gyroid structures reported in the literature. The PLA scaffolds can be anticipated as promising scaffold biomaterials for bone tissue engineering applications by virtue of their bone-mimicking porous structure and good mechanical properties. © 2020 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Fused deposition modeling; Gyroid; PLA; Porous scaffolds","3D printing; Biomechanics; Bone; Cell engineering; Deposition; Elastic moduli; Elastoplasticity; Porosity; Scaffolds (biology); Yield stress; Bone tissue engineering; Compressive tests; Elastic-plastic deformation; Gyroids; High-strength; Polylactic acid; Porous scaffold; Structural anisotropy; Tissue engineering applications; Unit cell size; Compressive strength","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP170102557, FT160100252); Australian Research Council, ARC","This research is financially supported by the Australian Research Council (ARC) through the discovery grant DP170102557 .

The morphology, fracture, tensile strength, stress, and strain of Hastelloy X alloy specimens were studied using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and a tensile tester. The temperature field of the manufacturing process was analyzed based on finite element analysis, and the internal relationship between the temperature field and the process was constructed in terms of cooling speed. The results show that the temperature field is a dynamic process with a high cooling rate; the average cooling rate reaches 3.23 × 106 °C × s-1. The greater the inclination angle, the greater the thermal gradient, resulting in higher cooling rates. Due to the cross-influence of grain refinement at high cooling rates and residual stress, the tensile strength and yield strength of Hastelloy X alloy showed first increasing and then decreasing trends with respect to inclination angle. However, at an inclination angle of 30°, the voids and crack defects of Hastelloy X alloy fractures were reduced, and the tensile strength and yield strength reached 881.38 and 701.60 MPa, respectively. At this angle, the mechanical properties were excellent and met the requirements of the aviation industry. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston, Germany 2021.","Hastelloy X; mechanical properties; microstructure; numerical analysis; Selective laser melting","Cooling; Grain refinement; Melting; Metal testing; Scanning electron microscopy; Temperature; Tensile strength; Yield stress; Aviation industry; Dynamic process; Hastelloy x alloys; High cooling rates; Inclination angles; Internal relationships; Manufacturing process; Tensile testers; Selective laser melting","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51875452); National High-tech Research and Development Program, (2015AA042503)","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51875452) and National High-tech R&D Program (863 Program) (2015AA042503).","Sun Y.B., Jin P.L., Ma J.H., He J., Cui J.H., Zhou K.R., Cui M.Q., Effect of heat treatment on microstructure and properties of Hastelloy X welded joints, Rare Metal Materials and Engineering, 48, 5, pp. 3029-3034, (2018); Zhao J.C., Larsen M., Ravikumar V., Phase precipitation and time-temperature-transformation diagram of Hastelloy X, Materials Science and Engineering A, 293, pp. 112-119, (2000); Ojo O.O., Taban E., Microstructure, mechanical and corrosion behavior of additively manufactured steel: A review (Part 1), Materials Testing, 62, 5, pp. 503-516, (2020); Striemann P., Huelsbusch D., Mrzljak S., Niedermeier M., Walther F., Systematic approach for the characterization of additive manufactured and injection molded short carbon fiber-reinforced polymers under tensile loading, Materials Testing, 62, 6, pp. 561-567, (2020); Lutz A., Huber L., Emmelmann C., Strain-rate dependent material properties of selective laser melted AlSi10Mg and AlSi3.5Mg2.5, Materials Testing, 62, 6, pp. 573-583, (2020); Stern F., Grabienski F., Walther F., Boes J., Rottger A., Theisen W., Influence of powder nitriding on the mechanical behavior of laser-powder bed fusion processed tool steel X30CrMo7-2, Materials Testing, 62, pp. 19-26, (2020); Marko A., Graf B., Rethmeier M., Statistical analysis of weld bead geometry in Ti6Al4 v laser cladding, Materials Testing, 59, 10, pp. 837-843, (2017); Esmaeilizadeh R., Keshavarzkermani A., Ali U., Mahmoodkhani Y., Behravesh B., Jahed H., Bonakdar A., Toyserkani E., Customizing mechanical properties of additively manufactured Hastelloy X parts by adjusting laser scanning speed, Journal of Alloys and Compounds, 812, (2020); Ni X.Q., Kong D.C., Zhang L., Dong C.F., Song J., Wu W.H., Effect of Process Parameters on the Mechanical Properties of Hastelloy X Alloy Fabricated by Selective Laser Melting, Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance, 28, pp. 5533-5540, (2019); Tian Y., Tomus D., Huang A.J., Wu X.H., Experimental and statistical analysis on process parameters and surface roughness relationship for selective laser melting of Hastelloy X, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 25, pp. 1309-1318, (2019); Du Y., You X.Y., Qiao F.B., Guo L.J., Liu Z.W., A model for predicting the temperature field during selective laser melting, Results in Physics, 12, pp. 52-60, (2019); Hussein A., Hao L., Yan C.Z., Everson R., Finite element simulation of the temperature and stress fields in single layers built without-support in selective laser melting, Materials and Design, 52, pp. 638-647, (2013); Liu K., Nonlinear behavior of thermal lagging in concentric living tissues with Gaussian distribution source, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 54, 13-14, pp. 2829-2836, (2011); Aloraier A.S., Joshi S., Residual stresses in flux cored arc welding process in bead-on-plate specimens, Materials Science and Engineering A, 534, pp. 13-21, (2012); Chen C., Gu D.D., Dai D.H., Du L., Wang R., Ma C.L., Xia M.J., Laser additive manufacturing of layered TiB2/Ti6Al4 v multi-material parts: Understanding thermal behavior evolution, Optics and Laser Technology, 119, (2019); Rubenchik A., Wu S., Mitchell S., Golosker I., Leblanc M., Peterson N., Direct measurements of temperature-dependent laser absorptivity of metal powders, Applied Optics, 54, pp. 7230-7233, (2015); Mills K.C., Recommended Values of Thermo-physical Properties for Selected Commercial Alloys, Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology, 74, 5, pp. 175-180, (2002); Xu W., Lui E.W., Pateras A., Qian M., Brandt M., In situ tailoring microstructure in additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4 v for superior mechanical performance, Acta Materialia, 125, pp. 390-400, (2017); Gupta H., Roy S., Geothermal Energy, Chapter 3 - Heat Transfer, pp. 31-48, (2007); Mertens R., Dadbakhsh S., Vanhumbeeck J., Krutha J.-P., Application of base plate preheating during selective laser melting, Procedia CIRP, 74, pp. 5-11, (2018); Li Y., Xu H.J., Ba F.H., He B.B., K.

One of the challenges in this field is the delicate manipulation of material properties and various disparate printing parameters to create structures with high fidelity. Understanding the effects of certain parameters and identifying optimal parameters for creating highly accurate structures are therefore a worthwhile subject to investigate. The objective of this study is to investigate high-impact print parameters on the printing printability and develop a preliminary machine learning model to optimize printing parameters. The results of this study will lead to an exploration of machine learning applications in bioprinting and to an improved understanding between 3D printing parameters and structural printability. Reported results include the effects of rheological property, nozzle gauge, nozzle temperature, path height, and ink composition on the printability of Pluronic F127. The developed Support Vector Machine model generated a process map to assist the selection of optimal printing parameters to yield high quality prints with high probability (<75%). Future work with more generalized machine learning models in bioprinting is also discussed in this article. The finding of this study provides a simple tool to improve printability of extrusion-based bioprinting with minimum experimentations. © 2021.

Several systems have already been created, one of which is a passive shape-adaptable finger based on the FinRay effect. The geometric shape of this finger ensures that the finger wraps around the object it grips. FinRay fingers have been studied in several studies, which have changed the internal structure and examined how gripping force’s dependence on finger deformation changes. So far, however, no specific way has been determined to evaluate the proposed finger regarding its ability to wrap around the object. This work comes up with a new and simple method to evaluate the finger’s wrapping around the object mathematically. Based on this evaluation method, several different patterns of the internal structure of FinRay fingers were tested. The fingers were first tested in a simulation program, which simulated a steel roller indentation with a diameter of 20 mm in the middle of the finger’s contact surface. Based on the simulation results, selected types of structure were made by the Fused Filament Fabrication method from a flexible filament and tested on a real test rig to verify the results of the simulation and compare it with the real behaviour. According to the methodology used, the results show that the most suitable structure of the selected tested fingers from the point of view of wrapping the finger around the object is a structure without internal filling. Designers can simply use the new evaluation method to compare their designed finger variants and select the most suitable one according to the ability to wrap around the gripped object. They can also use graphs from this work’s results and determine the finger’s dimensions without internal filling according to the required forces and deflection. © 2021 by the authors.

The performance function was established based on load corresponding to tolerable displacement (Qδtol) and design load (Qd). A dataset of published full-scale load tests including projects from Texas, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, and New Mexico was compiled and consisted of 60 load test cases com-prising 33 driven piles and 27 drilled shafts. Resistance factors for SLS conditions were calibrated for tolerable displacements using both the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) and the First Order Second Mo-ment (FOSM) approaches. From the calibration study, resistance factors at SLS conditions were obtained ranging from 0.33 to 0.62 using FOSM method and 0.37 to 0.67 using the MCS for driven piles. In the case of drilled shafts, SLS resistance factors ranged from 0.37 to 0.77 following the FOSM method and 0.41 to 0.86 based on MCS. © 2021 Deep Foundations Institute,.","calibration; deep foundations; load test; LRFD; Monte Carlo Simulation; serviceability limit state; Texas Cone Penetration test","","","","","","","","AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, (2014); Abu-Hejleh N., DiMaggio J.

Forecasting melt pool temperature profile during a process can help in reducing microstructural porosity and residual stresses. Although analytical and numerical models were reported, the performance of these are questionable when applied in real-time. Hence, we developed data-driven models to address this challenge, for continuous forecasting layer-wise melt pool temperature using a hybrid deep learning technique. The melt pool temperature forecasting by the proposed CNN-LSTM model is found to be better than other benchmark models in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The model results have shown that combining CNN and LSTM networks can extract the spatial and temporal information from the melt pool temperature data. Further, the proposed model results are compared with existing statistical and machine learning models. The performance measures of the proposed CNN-LSTM model indicate a greater potential for in-situ monitoring of additive manufacturing process.  © 2013 IEEE.","CNN; Deep learning; LSTM; Machine learning; Melt pool temperature forecasting; Statistical learning; Wire-arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Deep learning; Forecasting; Lakes; Learning systems; Additive manufacturing process; Analytical and numerical models; In- situ monitoring; Learning techniques; Machine learning models; Melt pool temperature; Performance measure; Temporal information; Long short-term memory","","","","","","","Molitch M., Boeing 777x Takes First Flight with over 600 3D-Printed Parts; Cunningham C.R., Flynn J.M., Shokrani A., Dhokia V., Newman S.T., Invited review article: Strategies and processes for high quality wire arc additive manufacturing, Additive Manuf., 22, pp. 672-686, (2018); Pickin C.G., Williams S.W., Lunt M., Characterisation of the cold metal transfer (CMT) process and its application for low dilution cladding, J.

Severe intergranular hot cracking is found to occur at grain boundaries (GBs) in the SEBM-built superalloy. A generalised cracking criterion that considers various process parameters along with the GB inclination is developed on the basis of a prevailing hot cracking criterion for columnar-grained microstructure. A parametric evaluation of influencing factors is quantitatively conducted to predict the optimal conditions that could prevent hot cracking while maintaining the desirable fine microstructure. With the aid of numerical simulations, it is determined that while micro-segregation occurs at all types of GBs, its occurrence at the divergent ones tend to promote cracking. Using the results of this work, hot cracking in additively manufactured Ni-based superalloy single crystals can be potentially mitigated. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Electron beam melting; Hot cracking; Solidification cracking; Superalloy","Additives; Electron beam melting; Electron beams; Grain boundaries; Nickel; Superalloys; Textures; Cracking criteria; Fine microstructure; Ni-based superalloys; Nickel- based superalloys; Optimal conditions; Process parameters; Selective electron beam melting; Solidification parameter; Nickel alloys","","","","","National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF","This research is supported by the National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore under its Medium-Sized Centre funding scheme.","Reed R.C., The Superalloys Fundamentals and Applications, (2008); Belan J., GCP and TCP phases presented in nickel-base superalloys, Mater.

During manufacturing by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), the laser-scanning path influences the thermo-mechanical behavior of parts. Therefore, it is necessary to validate the path generation considering the thermal behavior induced by this process to improve the quality of parts. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed model, based on the effect of successive thermal flashes along the scanning path, is calibrated and validated by comparison with thermal results obtained by FEM software and experimental measurements. A numerical investigation is performed to compare different scanning path strategies on the Ti6Al4V material with different stimulation parameters. Findings: The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the approach to simulate the thermal field to validate the scanning strategy. It suggests a change in the scale of simulation thanks to high-performance computing resources. Originality/value: The flash-based approach is designed to ensure the quality of the simulated thermal field while minimizing the computational cost. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing;

The production parameters, together with the AM method and the type of material, significantly influence product quality through surface finish and strength. The paper presents an approach that helps users define layer thickness by evaluating the design with several attributes, where both strength and surface roughness are criteria of interest for improving product quality. Weighted features, DfAM knowledge and a multi-attribute decision support tool, are used to recommend the most desirable layer thickness. Additive powder samples were used in the case study to show how the proposed approach contributes to product quality. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Additive manufacturing; layer thickness; multi-attribute decision support; weighting factors","3D printers; Additives; Decision support systems; Design for manufacturability; Quality control; Surface roughness; Build orientation; Design Analysis; Layer thickness; Multi-attribute decision supports; Product design and development process; Production parameters; Surface finishes; Weighted features; Product design","","","","","","","Bikas H., Koutsoukos S., Stavropoulos P., A Decision Support Method for Evaluation and Process Selection of Additive Manufacturing, Procedia CIRP, 81, pp. 1107-1112, (2019); Bikas H., Lianos A.K., Stavropoulos P., A Design Framework for Additive Manufacturing, The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 103, 9, pp. 3769-3783, (2019); Bikas H., Stavropoulos P., Chryssolouris G., Additive Manufacturing Methods and Modelling Approaches: A Critical Review, The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 83, 1, pp. 389-405, (2016); Dilberoglu U.M., Gharehpapagh B., Yaman U., Dolen M., The Role of Additive Manufacturing in the Era of Industry 4.0, Procedia Manufacturing, 11, January, pp. 545-554, (2017); Durao L.F.C.S., Barkoczy R., Zancul E., Lee Ho L., Bonnard R., Optimising Additive Manufacturing Parameters for the Fused Deposition Modeling Technology Using a Design of Experiments, Progress in Additive Manufacturing, 4, 3, pp. 291-313, (2019); Gohari H., Kishawy H., Tsuzuki M.S.G., Intelligent Process Planning for Additive Manufacturing, IFAC-PapersOnLine, 52, 10, pp. 218-223, (2019); Haik Y., Shahin T., Engineering Design Process, (2010); Jiang J., Ma Y., Path Planning Strategies to Optimise Accuracy, Quality, Build Time and Material Use in Additive Manufacturing: A Review, Micromachines, (2020); Jiang J., Xiong Y., Zhang Z., Rosen D.W., Machine Learning Integrated Design for Additive Manufacturing, Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, (2020); Kaljun J., Dolsak B., Ergonomic Design Knowledge Built in the Intelligent Decision Support System, International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics, 42, 1, pp. 162-171, (2012); Li H., Wang T., Sun J., Yu Z., The Adaptive Slicing Algorithm and Its Impact on the Mechanical Property and Surface Roughness of Freeform Extrusion Parts, Virtual and Physical Prototyping, 11, 1, pp. 27-39, (2016); Mao H., Kwok T.-H., Chen Y., Wang C.C.L., Adaptive Slicing Based on Efficient Profile Analysis, Computer-Aided Design, 107, pp. 89-101, (2019); Medellin-Castillo H.I., Zaragoza-Siqueiros J., Design and Manufacturing Strategies for Fused Deposition Modelling in Additive Manufacturing: A Review, Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering, 32, 1, (2019); Nomani J., Wilson D., Paulino M., Mohammed M.I., Effect of Layer Thickness and Cross-Section Geometry on the Tensile and Compression Properties of 3D Printed ABS, Materials Today Communications, 22, (2020); Pereira S., Vaz A.I.F., Vicente L.N., On the Optimal Object Orientation in Additive Manufacturing, The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 98, 5, pp. 1685-1694, (2018); Ponche R., Hascoet J.Y., Kerbrat O., Mognol P., A New Global Approach to Design for Additive Manufacturing, Virtual and Physical Prototyping, 7, 2, pp. 93-105, (2012); Prakash V.J., Surrey P., Moller M., Emmelmann C., Influence of Adaptive Slice Thickness and Retained Heat Effect on Laser Metal Deposited Thin-Walled Freeform Structures, Procedia CIRP, 74, pp. 233-237, (2018); Sufiiarov V.S., Popovich A.A., Borisov E.V., Polozov I.A., Masaylo D.V., Orlov A.V., The Effect of Layer Thickness at Selective Laser Melting, Procedia Engineering, 174, pp. 126-134, (2017); Thompson M.K., Moroni G., Vaneker T., Fadel G., Campbell R.I., Gibson I., Bernard A., Et al., Design for Additive Manufacturing: Trends, Opportunities, Considerations, and Constraints, CIRP Annals, 65, 2, pp. 737-760, (2016); Vaezi M., Chua C.K., Effects of Layer Thickness and Binder Saturation Level Parameters on 3D Printing Process, The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 53, 1, pp. 275-284, (2011); Vaneker T., Bernard A., Moroni G., Gibson I., Zhang Y., Design for Additive Manufacturing: Framework and Methodology, CIRP Annals, 69, 2, pp. 578-599, (2020); Wang Y., Blache R., Xu X., Selection of Additive Manufacturing Processes, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 23, 2, pp. 434-447, (2017); Wang Y., Zhong R.Y., Xu X., A Decision Support System for Additive Manufacturing Process Selection Using A Hybrid Multiple Criteria Decision-Making Method, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 24, 9, pp. 1544-1553, (2018)","N.

When Design for Additive Manufacturing is conducted properly, lightweight potential can be exploited. This contribution introduces a novel design approach for the widespread fused layer modelling (FLM) technology when using orthotropic Fibre Reinforced Polymer filament. Its objective is to obtain stiff and strong load-path optimized FLM structures in a structured and algorithmic way. The approach therefore encompasses (1) build orientation optimization to consider weaker bonding between layers than intralayer; (2) topology optimization with orthotropic material properties to obtain favourable overall geometry and inner structure; (3) direct build path generation from optimized material orientation and alternatives to the direct generation and (4) simulation. The approach is demonstrated using a lift arm under multiple load cases and further demonstrator parts to show its general applicability. Lightweight potential of individual optimization steps and the influence of modifications contrasting general non-FLM-specific optimization are studied and discussed. © The Author(s), 2021.

The structural evolution was studied by X-ray powder diffraction, optical microscopy, as well as scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Special focus was placed on fine structure investigation to identify strengthening phases and alloying elements distribution. It was found that different Laves phases were formed in the interdendritic space during LPBF and were transformed to MC and M23C6 carbide phases during the subsequent HIP and HT. HIP resulted in healing of microcracks and large pores, as well as segregation of the strengthening γ’-phase consisting of irregularly shaped inclusions of heterogeneous size. Heat treatment led to a higher content of the γ’-phase, its refinement and more homogeneous distribution within the alloy matrix. Exposure to HIP and HT gave rise to a material characterized by ultimate tensile strength σ ~ 1350 MPa and ductility δ ~ 12% (its strength characteristics were more than 30% superior to those of the LPBF samples). © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Hot isostatic pressing (HIP); Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF); Mechanical properties; Nickel based superalloy; Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)","Alloying elements; Carbides; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Metallic matrix composites; Microcracks; Microstructure; Nickel alloys; Scanning electron microscopy; Sintering; Tensile strength; X ray powder diffraction; Elements distribution; Homogeneous distribution; Interdendritic space; Microstructure and properties; Scanning and transmission electron microscopy; Strength characteristics; Structural evolution; Ultimate tensile strength; Hot isostatic pressing","","","","","LPBF; Russian Academy of Science; Hispanics in Philanthropy, HIP; Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka, (0718-2020-0034); Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (19-79-10226); Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation","Funding text 1: This work was carried out with financial support from the Russian Science Foundation (Project No. 19-79-10226 ) in the part involving of LPBF and the effect of HIP, HT on alloy properties and support from the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation under the state assignment (Project No. 0718-2020-0034 ) in the part involving of HRTEM studies.

Detection of edges is a basic requirement for diverse contexts for design automation. This study presents a guideline to assign appropriate threshold and sigma values for the Canny edge detector to increase the efficiency of additive manufacturing. The algorithm uses different combinations of threshold and sigma on a color palette, and the results are statistically formulated using multiple regression analysis with an accuracy of 95.93%. An image-based acquisition technique system is designed and developed for test applications to create three-dimensional objects. In addition, a graphical user interface is developed to convert a selected design of a complex image to a three-dimensional object with the generation of Cartesian coordinates of the detected edges and extrusion. The developed system reduces the cost and time of developing an existing design of an object for additive manufacturing by 20% and 70%, respectively. © 2021 The author(s).","Additive manufacturing; Cartesian-coordinates; Edge detection; Image-based acquisition; Industrial automation; Product design","Additives; Computer aided design; Edge detection; Graphical user interfaces; Product design; Regression analysis; Textures; Canny edge detection; Cartesian coordinate; Illumination intensity; Image-based; Image-based acquisition; Industrial automation; Surface illumination; Surface reflectance; Surface textures; Three-dimensional object; 3D printers","","","","","Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology; Thammasat University, TU","This research study is supported by the Graduate Scholarship for Excellent Foreign Students and Young Researcher Grant 2014 from Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology, Thammasat University, Thailand.","Hughes W.

The current work developed a Si-modified Al7075 alloy aiming at introducing eutectic phases to mitigate the solidification cracking during L-PBF. Based on Kou’s model, the addition of Zn and Mg decreased the crack susceptibility from 6504 °C to 5966 °C, and the addition of 3.74 wt pct of Si further decreased the crack susceptibility to 3960 °C. The Al7075 alloy fabricated by L-PBF exhibited a large amount of solidification cracks extending throughout the sample. Crack-free samples with a relative density of 99.94 pct, as inspected by X-ray microcomputed tomography, were achieved for the developed Si-modified Al7075 alloy. The microstructure showed a transition from a coarse columnar microstructure to a refined mixed columnar + equiaxed microstructure after alloy modification, with a concomitant grain size reduction from 59.0 ± 42.2 to 15.0 ± 9.4 µm. Moreover, Si, Mg2Si, and Al2Cu phases were detected in the Si-modified Al7075 alloy. After a direct ageing heat treatment, the Si-modified Al7075 alloy showed minimal age hardening effect with a peak hardness of (146 ± 3 Hv). © 2020, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.","","Age hardening; Binary alloys; Computerized tomography; Copper alloys; Fabrication; Heat treatment; High strength alloys; Magnesium alloys; Precipitation (chemical); Silicon alloys; Solidification; Textures; Columnar microstructures; Crack susceptibilities; Equiaxed microstructures; High strength aluminum alloys; Precipitation behavior; Solidification cracking; Solidification cracks; X ray micro-computed tomography; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; KU Leuven, (GOA/15/012); KU Leuven; China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201706220083); China Scholarship Council, CSC; Horizon 2020, (755610); Horizon 2020","Funding text 1: This work was funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Clean Sky 2 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 755610, project AlForAMA.

Firstly, a compound filling algorithm in which the inner zone is filled by linear scanning and the outer contour is filled by offsetting is developed in order to solve the problems encountered in filling path planning for wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) like staircase effect at marginal division, degenerated edge at outer contour, programming difficulty, and so forth. Meanwhile, the attitude control algorithm of welding gun is proposed to control the angle between welding gun and welding path so as to improve the welding forming quality. Secondly, the high-temperature and low-temperature wear resistances of Fe-based and Ni-based alloy are tested. The results show that Ni-based alloy has higher high-temperature wear resistance. Finally, a disabled crankshaft hot forging die is selected for application test and the results show that, using the techniques discussed in this paper, welding materials can be saved by more than 50% and machining cost can be saved by more than 60%. In addition, the surface of automatic-repaired die is smooth without oxidation, collapse, and other defects after forging 3000 times, which is much better than that of manual-repaired die. © 2021 Jiansheng Zhang et al.","","Additives; Attitude control; Dies; Filling; Forging; FORTH (programming language); Nickel alloys; Quality control; Repair; Temperature; Wear of materials; Wear resistance; Welding; Additive manufacturing process; Compound filling; High temperature; High temperature wear resistance; Low temperatures; Machining costs; Staircase effect; Welding materials; 3D printers","","","","","","","B.

However, the off-axis tensile strength (TS) and Mode I fracture toughness of fused filament fabricated (FFFed) continuous-glass-fiber-reinforced (CGFR) nylon are unknown. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the mechanical and fracture behavior of FFFed CGFR nylon with various fiber content and off-axis fiber alignment. Design/methodology/approach: Tensile tests were performed on FFFed CGFR-nylon with 9.5, 18.9 and 28.4 fiber vol. %. TS was tested with fiber orientations between 0∘ and 90∘ at 15∘ intervals. Double cantilever beam tests were performed to reveal the Mode I fracture toughness of FFFed composites. Findings: TS increased with increasing fiber vol. % from 122 MPa at 9.5 vol. % to 291 MPa at 28 vol. %. FFFed nylon with a triangular infill resulted in 37 vol. % porosity and a TS of 12 MPa. Composite samples had 11–12 vol. % porosity. TS decreased by 78% from 291 MPa to 64 MPa for a change in fiber angle θ from 0∘ (parallel to the tensile stress) to 15∘. TS was between 27 and 17 MPa for 300 < θ < 900. Mode I fracture toughness of all the composites were lower than ∼332 J/m2. Practical implications: Practical applications of FFFed continuous-fiber-reinforced (CFR) nylon should be limited to designs where tensile stresses align within 15∘ of the fiber orientation. Interlayer fracture toughness of FFFed CFR composites should be confirmed for product designs that operate under Mode I loading. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study showing the effects of fiber orientation on the mechanical behavior and effects of the fiber content on the Mode I fracture toughness of FFFed CGFR nylon. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing; FDM; Fused deposition modeling; Porosity; Unidirectional fiber composite","Cantilever beams; Fabrication; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fracture mechanics; Glass fibers; Polyamides; Porosity; Rayon; Tensile strength; Tensile stress; Tensile testing; Composite samples; Continuous fibers; Design/methodology/approach; Double cantilever beam test; Fracture behavior; High performance composites; Mechanical behavior; Mode-i fracture toughness; Fracture toughness","","","","","College of Engineering, San Jose State University","The authors thank for the partial support by the College of Engineering, San Jose State University.

A Hf-free version of CM247LC, CM247LC NHf, and CM247LC (~1.4 wt% Hf) were subjected to identical thermal treatments and characterized. After solutionizing at 1260 °C for 2 h, both alloys displayed recrystallization and grain growth. The CM247LC NHf had numerous annealing twins suggesting that Hf inhibits twin formation. The CM247LC NHf alloy displayed a lower peak hardness than CM247LC (5000 MPa and 5200 MPa, respectively) and this was attributed to a ~6% point reduction (Calphad calculated) in γ′ phase fraction due to the removal of Hf. Despite the lower hardness values, the CM247LC NHf displayed a higher yield strength than CM247LC at 760 °C (969 MPa and 926 MPa, respectively). Elongation at fracture at 760 °C was similar (~1%) for both CM247LC and CM247LC NHf. The removal of Hf was shown to be effective at mitigating the strain age cracking susceptibility of CM247LC, likely due to the decrease in γ’ phase fraction and lattice mismatch. © 2020 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; CM247LC; Ni-base superalloys","Grain growth; Hafnium; Hardness; Heat treatment; Lattice mismatch; Superalloys; Annealing twins; Lower hardness; Ni-base superalloys; Peak hardness; Phase fractions; Strain-age cracking; Treatment response; Twin formation; Nickel alloys","","","","","Competence Centre for Materials Science and Technology, CCMX","The authors would like to acknowledge the Competence Center for Materials Science and Technology (CCMX) for financial support, as well as the Swiss Industrial Consortium associated to the project.

In this study, we report the development of a new bioink using oligo(poly[ethylene glycol] fumarate) (OPF), a photo-crosslinkable, and biodegradable polymer, for 3D bioprinting. In addition to OPF, a small portion of gelatin was also incorporated into the bioink to make it bio-printable. After immersion in the cell medium, gelatin was eluted away to create a bioprinted scaffold of pure OPF. Excellent cell viability, spreading, and long-term proliferation of encapsulated cells was observed using both bone and nerve cells as examples. These results demonstrate that OPF bioink has great potential in future 3D bioprinting applications that aim to replicate complex, layered tissues, and/or organs. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","3D bioprinting; bioink; hydrogel; oligo(poly[ethylene glycol] fumarate); tissue engineering","3T3 Cells; Animals; Bioprinting; Bone and Bones; Bone Regeneration; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Cross-Linking Reagents; Fumarates; Gelatin; Hydrogels; Mice; Nerve Regeneration; Nerve Tissue; Neurons; Osteocytes; Polyethylene Glycols; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; 3D printers; Aliphatic compounds; Biodegradable polymers; Bone; Cells; Cytology; Ethylene; Ethylene glycol; Neurons; Polyols; Tissue; gelatin; hydrogel; oligo(poly[ethylene glycol]fumarate); polymer; unclassified drug; cross linking reagent; fumaric acid derivative; macrogol; poly(ethylene glycol fumarate); Bioprinting; Cell viability; Cross-linkable; Encapsulated cell; Growth factor; Layered tissue; Nerve tissue engineering; Tissue restoration; Article; bone cell; cell count; cell encapsulation; cell growth; cell proliferation; cell spreading; cell structure; cell viability; controlled study; cross linking; freeze drying; gelation; immersion; MC3T3 cell line; nerve cell; nervous tissue; osteoblast; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; scanning electron microscopy; three dimensional bioprinting; tissue engineering; 3T3 cell line; animal; bioprinting; bone; bone regeneration; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; hydrogel; mouse; nerve regeneration; nervous tissue; osteocyte; procedures; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; Scaffolds (biology)","","gelatin, 9000-70-8; macrogol, 25322-68-3; Cross-Linking Reagents, ; Fumarates, ; Gelatin, ; Hydrogels, ; poly(ethylene glycol fumarate), ; Polyethylene Glycols, ","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS, (R01AR056212)","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health grant R01 AR56212.

The relationship between the evaluation index and the performance of parts made by directed energy deposition was established and verified by experiments. The differences of thermal evolution between four scanning patterns were analysed. Comprehensive evaluation indices corresponding to different scanning patterns were calculated by integrating the contributions of various parameters, such as delamination, warping, porosity, heat accumulation, cooling rate, dendrite spacing, and deposition efficiency. The comprehensive evaluation indices off our scanning patterns were ranked in the following order (from lowest to highest): single-track zigzag, single-track, bi-direction, and spiral inward patterns. The performance of the single-track zigzag pattern was the best, and that of the spiral inward pattern was the worst. The single-track and bi-direction patterns showed intermediate performances under the same conditions. The closer the index is to zero, the better the performance. This index can be used for the quantitative evaluation of process quality and prediction of performance. It provides guidance for additive manufacturing process development and optimisation, reduces workload, and provides a new idea for quantitative performance evaluation and prediction of parts fabricated by additive manufacturing. © 2021 The Author(s).

It holds an important place in theory and practice, because a huge number of real-world problems, such as timetabling, planning, routing, bioinformatics, fault diagnosis, etc., could be encoded into it. Stochastic local search (SLS) methods can solve many real-world problems that often involve large-scale instances at reasonable computation costs while delivering good-quality solutions. In this work, we propose a novel SLS algorithm called adaptive variable depth SLS for PMSAT problem solving based on a dynamic local search framework. Our algorithm exploits two algorithmic components of an SLS method: parameter tuning and neighborhood search. Our first contribution is the design of an adaptive parameter tuner that searches for the best parameter setting for each instance by considering its features. The second contribution is a variable depth neighborhood search (VDS) algorithm adopted for PMSAT problem, which our empirical evaluation proves is a more efficient w.r.t. single neighborhood search. We conducted our experiments on the PMSAT benchmarks from MaxSAT Evaluation 2014 to 2019, including more than 3600 instances which have been encoded from a broad range of domains such as verification, optimization, graph theory, automated-reasoning, pseudo Boolean, etc. Our experimental evaluation results show that AVD-SLS solver, which is implemented based on our algorithm, outperforms state-of-the-art PMSAT SLS solvers in most benchmark classes, including random, crafted, and industrial instances. Furthermore, AVD-SLS reports remarkably better results on weighted benchmark, and shows competitive results with several well-known hybrid PMSAT solvers. © 2021 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Prototypes were developed as part of the student formula project, where several parts originally produced by machining were replaced by castings. The techniques of topological optimization and the combination with the tools of the numerical simulation were used to optimise the virtual prototype before a real production of the first prototype. 3D printing of wax pattern ensured direct and fast assembly of the cluster without any additional operations and troubles during dewaxing. The shell was manufactured in 6 hours thanks to a system of quick-drying of individual layers of ceramic shell. It has been verified that the right combination of individual virtual tools with the rapid prototyping can shorten the development time and delivery of the first prototypes from a few months to a few weeks. © 2021 Polish Academy of Sciences.

Current commercial mechanisms have problems related to their limited degree of freedom. In order to improve them, there are possibilities to adapt either a serial manipulator or a kinematics parallel mechanism to the process. The first ones have disadvantages related to cost, inertia ant answer time; the second ones can solve these issues. However, using these kinds of mechanisms is necessary, considering other types of aspects such as mechanical configuration, dynamics behavior, and workspace. For these reasons, this work collects information related to the above features of parallel mechanisms focused on additive manufacturing. Finally, this kind of analysis and information can be useful for other processes or studies that use kinematics parallel mechanisms. © 2021.

Effects of laser energy volume density (EVD) and tempering temperature on the microstructure and properties of HP-SLM 24CrNiMo steel were studied. Results show that as the EVD increases, the grows direction of lath martensite microstructure changes to disordered. When EVD is 120 J mm−3, the UTS of HP-SLM 24CrNiMoY steel reaches 1125 ± 15 MPa. High UTS is benefit from the fine martensite lath and high density of dislocations. Additionally, tempering treatment can reduce the dislocation density in martensite and promote the precipitation of ϵ carbides. After tempering at 500°C, the EL of HP-SLM 24CrNiMoY steel increased to 7.5% and the product of strength and plasticity increased by 37.8%. This study provides a technical reference for HP-SLM technology to prepare the high-performance 24CrNiMoY alloy steel. © 2020 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining Published by Taylor & Francis on behalf of the Institute.","24CrNiMoY alloy steel;

The objective ofthis project was to show a proof-of-concept ofadditively manufacturing metal powder that was gas atomized in a Mobile Foundry housed within a shipping container from scrap rolled homogeneous armor (RHA) steel. The resultant alloy powder was subjected to laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), for builds that were tested metallurgically and ballistically. Cursory results showed that the additive manufactured builds from powder made from recycled RHA had a martensitic structure as stress-relieved, exhibited excellent mechanical properties, and improved ballistic properties versus this alloy in the wrought condition. © 2021 COMADEM International.

In the proposed scheme, every distinct phase sequence is represented by a unique Orthogonal comb pilot sequence (OPS), and the orthogonal properties of the OPSs are used to distinguish the index of phase sequences at the receiver. Therefore, the proposed scheme does not need to reserve bits for transmitting SI, so that the data rate can be raised. Simulation results show that the PAPR reduction performance has almost 0.5dB gains comparing to the Conventional SLM (C-SLM) scheme and the Bit error ratio (BER) performance is approximately the same as the SLM scheme with perfect SI. Field experimental results also demonstrate that the proposed scheme can differentiate phase sequences, therefore significantly enhance the quality of the UWA OFDM communication system. © 2021 Chinese Institute of Electronics","OFDM; PAPR reduction; Selected mapping; Underwater acoustic communication","Mapping; Underwater acoustic communication; Underwater acoustics; Comb pilots; Mapping scheme; OFDM systems; Peak to average power reductions; Peak-to-average power ratio reductions; Phase sequence; Pilot sequences; Reduction method; Selected mapping; Side information; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, NNSF, NNSFC, (61431004, 61501134, 61571151); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, NNSF, NNSFC","","Jiang P., Wang X., Liu J., “A sensor redeployment algorithm based on virtual forces for underwater sensor networks”, Chinese Journal of Electronics, 27, 2, pp. 413-421, (2018); Xing S., Gang Q., Ma L., “A blind side information detection method for partial transmitted sequence peak-to-average power seduction scheme in OFDM underwater acoustic communication system”, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 24128-24136, (2018); Wang W., Gang Q., Wang Y., Et al., “Decision feedback estimation of multiple input / multiple output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing channel based on punching technique via UWA shallow sea”, Acta Armamentarii, 34, 9, pp. 1116-1124, (2013); Muller S.H., Huber J.B., “OFDM with reduced peak-to-average power ratio by optimum combination of partial transmit sequences”, Electronics Letters, 33, 5, pp. 368-369, (1997); Luo R., Zhang C., Na N., Li R., “A low-complexity PTS based on greedy genetic algorithm for OFDM systems”, Chinese Journal of Electronics, 24, 4, pp. 857-861, (2015); Bauml R.W., Fische R.F.H., Huber J.B., “Reducing the peak-to-average power ratio of multicarrier modulation by selected mapping”, Electronics Letters, 44, 9, pp. 2056-2057, (2016); Joo H., No J., Shin D., “A blind SLM PAPR reduction scheme using cyclic shift in STBC MIMO-OFDM system”, pp. 272-273, (2010); Yang L., Hu W., He X., “Low complexity SLM algorithm based on cyclic shift and blind detection in SFBC MIMO-OFDM system”, Acta Electronica Sinica, 43, 8, pp. 1637-1641, (2015); Julia Fernandez-Getino Garcia M., Edfors O., Paez-Borrallo J.M., “Peak power reduction for OFDM systems with orthogonal pilot sequences”, IEEE Transaction on Wireless Communications, 5, 1, pp. 47-51, (2006); Zheng D., Beaulieu N.C., Zhu J., “Selective time-domain filtering for reduced-complexity PAR reduction in OFDM”, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 58, 3, pp. 1170-1176, (2009); Eom S., Nam H., Ko Y., “Low-Complexity PAPR reduction scheme without side information for OFDM systems”, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 60, 7, pp. 3657-3669, (2012)","Q.I.A.O.

The intrinsic tempering effect contributes to a superior mechanical property than traditional manufacturing methods in as-built condition, promoting subsequent heat treatments (HTs) for excellent mechanical properties. The influence of HTs on the microstructures and mechanical properties were characterised in multi-scales. A large number of carbides are intrinsically formed due to the tempering effect during deposition. The high-density dislocations in the as-built sample facilitate the formation of massive nano-twins and carbides during HT. The HTed sample achieves a true tensile stress of about 1.81 GPa together with a true strain of about 21%, achieving an excellent strength-ductility combination compared to wide-range high-strength steels processed by additive manufacturing and conventional methods. The grain and twin boundaries strengthening, precipitation strengthening and dislocation strengthening contribute to the high strength, while the good ductility originates from twinning induced plasticity (TWIP) and transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) effects, and high work-hardening rate, during deformation. The findings imply a potential way to develop AM-customised materials by fully understanding and utilising the IHT effect. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Additive manufacturing; intrinsic heat treatment; strength-ductility combination; strengthening mechanism; twinning induced plasticity (TWIP)","3D printers; Additives; Carbides; Ductility; Plasticity; Strain hardening; Strengthening (metal); Tempering; Conventional methods; Dislocation strengthening; Grain and twin boundaries; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Precipitation strengthening; Traditional manufacturing; Transformation induced plasticity; Twinning-induced plasticities; High strength steel","","","","","Career Development Fund, (C210112051); Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR, (A1893a0031); Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR; State Key Laboratory for Mechanical Behavior of Materials","Funding text 1: This work was supported by Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star), the Republic of Singapore, under the IAF-PP program ‘Integrated large format hybrid manufacturing using wire-fed and powder-blown technology for LAAM process’ (Grant No: A1893a0031) and Career Development Fund (Grant No: C210112051).

To achieve sustainable development of social economy, green technology innovation emerges in response to the proper time and conditions. In this context, the correct approach to measure the efficiency of green technology innovation in China's industrial enterprises is an important research topic. Based on existing studies, this paper divides innovation activities into two stages based on the innovation value chain and constructs a two-stage evaluation index system including all kinds of undesirable outputs transferred from negative externalities of the ecological environment. To evaluate green technology innovation efficiency, SBM and EBM network DEA models are applied to conduct empirical analysis from the perspective of time and space. This paper also calculates the efficiency values based on the SBM model and the EBM model, respectively, and compares the differences between them. The results show that the efficiency value of the achievement transformation stage is significantly higher than that of technology development stage; there are noticeable gaps in the efficiency of green technology innovation between different regions of China. Besides, the eastern region has a better performance in green technology innovation than the western region and Qinghai has the best green technology innovation performance. Combining the empirical results, the corresponding policy recommendations are put forward.  © 2021 Wei Chen et al.","","Ecology; Economics; Efficiency; Engineering research; Environmental technology; Green manufacturing; Industrial research; Sustainable development; Ecological environments; Efficiency evaluation; Evaluation index system; Industrial enterprise; Industrial revolutions; Negative externalities; Policy recommendations; Technology development; Economic and social effects","","","","","","","Kemp R., Smith K., Becher G., How should we study the relationship between environmental regulation and innovation?, Innovation-Oriented Environmental Regulation, pp. 43-66, (2000); Luo L., Liang S., Green technology innovation efficiency and factor decomposition of China's industrial enterprises, China Population, Resources and Environment, 26, 9, pp. 149-157, (2016); Qian L., Wang W., Xiao R., Research on the regional disparities of China's industrial enterprises green innovation efficiency from the perspective of shared inputs, China Population, Resources and Environment, 28, 5, pp. 27-39, (2018); Szajt M., Aktywność patentowa państw OECD w ujȩciu regionalnym - Konwergencja czy utrzymanie status quo, Studies of the Industrial Geography Commission of the Polish Geographical Society, 31, 4, pp. 40-51, (2017); Bai J., Jiang K., Li J., Convergence analysis of regional innovation efficiency in China, Finance and Trade Economy, 28, 9, pp. 119-123, (2008); Li X., Long H., Research focus, frontier and knowledge base of green technology in China: Metrological research based on mapping knowledge domains, Polish Journal of Environmental Studies, 29, 5, pp. 3003-3011, (2020); Pan X., Liu F., Research on industrial enterprise's innovation efficiency in China based on regional comparison, Management Review, 22, 2, pp. 59-64, (2010); Li X., Zhu J., Innovation efficiency and convergence research on China's provincial industrial enterprises, Journal of Applied Statistics and Management, 32, 6, pp. 1090-1099, (2013); Zhang K., Jiang W., Xu Y., Hou Y., Zhang S., Liu W., Assessing the corporate green technology progress and environmental governance performance based on the panel data on industrial enterprises above designated size in Anhui Province, China, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 28, 1, pp. 1151-1169, (2021); Furman J.-L., Porter M.-E., Scott S., The determinants of national innovative capacity, Research Policy, 31, 6, pp. 899-933, (2002); Hansen M.T., Birkinshaw J., The innovation value chain, Harvard Business Review, 85, 6, pp. 121-142, (2007); Liu C., Gao X., Ma W., Chen X., Research on regional differences and influencing factors of green technology innovation efficiency of China's high-tech industry, Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, 369, (2020); Fang Z., Hua B., Yuriy B., Evaluation research of green innovation efficiency in China's heavy polluting industries, Sustainability, 12, 1, (2020); Tang K., Qiu Y., Zhou D., Does command-and-control regulation promote green innovation performance?

Cobalt-nanoparticles with kerosene as the base fluid are considered. The governing partial differential conservation equations and convenient boundary conditions are rendered into a nondimensional form. The finite difference method (FDM) is then applied to determine the solution of a collection of resultant equations. The outcomes obtained by FDM have also compared with cited investigation. Illustrations describing influences of prominent parameters which provides physical interpretations of velocity, angular velocity, and temperature fields as well as the skin friction coefficient and Nusselt number are examined in detail with the help of graphical representations. This investigation determined that the skin-friction coefficient and heat transport rate reduced along with augmentation in the magnetic force and micropolar parameter, while opposite performance is adhered with elevating in the thermal radiation. Moreover, the boosted nanoparticle volume fraction reduced the skin friction coefficient and improved the Nusselt number. © The Author(s) 2021.","isoflux sphere; micropolar ferrofluid; Natural convection;

If sales quantities are disclosed, potential customers will increase (decrease) their willingness to pay for the product based on the observation of relatively high (low) sales. In a monopoly market, a firm can control initial sales through the initial price, thus influencing consumers' SL outcomes. We find that disclosing sales quantities and enhancing SL are always beneficial for a firm in a monopoly context. With an increase in the intensity of SL, a monopoly firm has a higher incentive to decrease the initial price of a product to attract early buyers, which is beneficial for consumers. However, consumer surplus may decrease if consumers' purchase intentions are strongly driven by historical sales quantities. In a duopoly market, learning based on historical sales quantities can encourage potential customers but intensify competition between firms. Thus, in a competitive market, sales disclosure and SL are only beneficial to firms when consumers' intrinsic valuation of a product is relatively low. Otherwise, SL harms firms.  © 2021 Rui Zheng et al.","","Commerce; Competition; Costs; Competitive markets; Consumer surplus; Duopoly markets; Monopoly markets; Potential customers; Purchase intention; Social learning; Willingness to pay; Sales","","","","","Wuhan University of Technology, WUT, (3120621190, 40120596); Wuhan University of Technology, WUT","This study was partially supported by grants from Wuhan University of Technology (40120596 and 3120621190).","Jing B., Social learning and dynamic pricing of durable goods, Marketing Science, 30, 5, pp. 851-865, (2011); Chen Y., Wang Q., Xie J., Online social interactions: A natural experiment on word of mouth versus observational learning, Journal of Marketing Research, 48, 2, pp. 238-254, (2011); Yu M., Debo L., Kapuscinski R., Strategic waiting for consumer-generated quality information: Dynamic pricing of new experience goods, Management Science, 62, 2, pp. 410-435, (2015); Papanastasiou Y., Savva N., Dynamic pricing in the presence of social learning and strategic consumers, Management Science, 63, 4, pp. 919-939, (2017); Crapis D., Ifrach B., Maglaras C., Scarsini M., Monopoly pricing in the presence of social learning, Management Science, 63, 11, pp. 3586-3608, (2017); Carare O., The impact of bestseller rank on demand: Evidence from the app market∗, International Economic Review, 53, 3, pp. 717-742, (2012); Sun S., Zheng X., Sun L., Multi-period pricing in the presence of competition and social influence, International Journal of Production Economics, 227, (2020); Hu M., Wang Z., Feng Y., Information disclosure and pricing policies for sales of network goods, Operations Research, 20, (2020); Pan C., Xiaomi Says Sales of Its New 5G Mi 10 Phones Have Exceeded 1 Million in Mainland China, (2020); Banerjee A.V., A simple model of herd behavior, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 107, 3, pp. 797-817, (1992); Bikhchandani S., Hirshleifer D., Welch I., A theory of fads, fashion, custom, and cultural change as informational cascades, Journal of Political Economy, 100, 5, pp. 992-1026, (1992); Liu T., Schiraldi P., New product launch: Herd seeking or herd preventing?, Economic Theory, 51, 3, pp. 627-648, (2012); Zhang J., Liu Y., Chen Y., Social learning in networks of friends versus strangers, Marketing Science, 34, 4, pp. 573-589, (2015); Feldman P., Papanastasiou Y., Segev E., Social learning and the design of new experience goods, Management Science, 65, 4, pp. 1502-1519, (2019); Peng W., Tian Z., Wang Y., Price guarantee for advance selling in the presence of preorder-dependent social learning, International Journal of Production Economics, 219, pp. 115-122, (2020); Hu M., Milner J., Wu J., Liking and following and the newsvendor: Operations and marketing policies under social influence, Management Science, 62, 3, pp. 867-879, (2016); Jiang B.-J., Wang B., Impact of consumer reviews and ratings on sales, prices, and profits: Theory and evidence, Icis 2008 Proceedings, 23, (2008); Qian Y., Counterfeiters: Foes or friends?

The temperature distribution of the part was first predicted by an analytical thermal model, which consists of a linear heat source solution and a heat sink solution. The temperature increase due to laser power input was calculated by the point moving heat source solution. The temperature drop due to thermal conduction, convection, and radiation at part boundaries was calculated by the heat sink solution. The coefficient of laser power absorption was inversely obtained by comparing predicted molten pool widths with experimental measurements. The lack-of-fusion area was then calculated by plotting molten pool shapes of multi-tracks and multi-layers on a transverse cross-sectional area of the part. The powder bed porosity was calculated by an advancing front method with the consideration of powder size distribution and packing pattern. Finally, the lack-of-fusion porosity was obtained by multiplying the lack-of-fusion area with powder bed porosity. The predicted results were close to the measurements of Ti6Al4V in LPBF. The maximum deviation for porosity prediction is 5.91%. The presented model shows high computational efficiency without relying on iteration-based numerical method. The computational time for five consecutive layers is less than 100 s. The acceptable accuracy, short computational time, and the ability to consider complex boundary effects make the proposed method a good basis for future research and a promising tool for optimization of process parameters in LPBF of complex parts. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Analytical model; Boundary heat loss; Lack-of-fusion porosity; Laser power absorption; Powder-bed fusion","Aluminum alloys; Computational efficiency; Forecasting; Heat conduction; Heat sinks; Iterative methods; Numerical methods; Titanium alloys; Advancing front method; Computational time; Cross sectional area; Linear heat sources; Moving heat sources; Optimization of process parameters; Porosity predictions; Temperature increase; Porosity","","","","","Boeing","The authors received financial support from The Boeing Company.

Materials manufactured by additive manufacturing technologies (Dental LT Clear, Freeprint Splint, Freeprint Ortho, V-Print Splint) as well as subtractive technologies (Yamahachi PMMA, Smile PEEK) were evaluated and compared to the cold polymerizing PMMA (Orthocryl) used for conventional TPPs. The test was carried out using a modified protocol following DIN EN ISO 20795-2:2013, for which materials are pre-conditioned by storage in distilled water for 50 ± 2 h at 37 ± 1 °C. The flexural strength and modulus of each material was then determined by a three-point bending test. Orthocryl showed one of the lowest flexural strength values (93.5 ± 3.0 MPa) while Dental LT Clear exhibited the highest flexural strength (147.7 ± 5.0 MPa; p = 0.0465) among the additive manufacturing materials. Smile PEEK showed the highest value (244.0 ± 1.7 MPa; p < 0.0001) among the subtractive manufacturing samples. Freeprint Ortho did not show a significantly different flexural strength value (92.6 ± 9.9 MPa; p = 0.0890). The tested materials exhibited comparable or superior properties to Orthocryl. Therefore, materials manufactured by CAD/CAM technologies seem to have suitable mechanical properties for the intended application. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive Manufacturing (AM); Flexural strength; Mechanical testing; Orthodontic Materials; Subtractive Manufacturing (SM)","Additives; Bending dies; Bending strength; Computer aided design; Additive manufacturing technology; Cad/cams; Different class; Distilled water; In-vitro; Orthodontic appliances; Three-point bending test; 3D printers","","","","","Tuebingen University Hospital; VOCO GmbH","We would like to thank the team of the department of neonatology, as well as that from the oral and maxillofacial surgery departments of Tuebingen University Hospital for the great work.

An improved full-discretization method (FDM) is proposed to predict the SLD based on the hybrid interpolation scheme of the Newton and Lagrange polynomials. In order to solve the SLD, a third-order Newton polynomial is employed to interpolate the state term of the physical space equation of the system. Meanwhile, to investigate the influence of the interpolation order on predicting the SLD, the delayed term is estimated using the Lagrange polynomials of orders one to four successively. Subsequently, after constructing the transition matrix, a series of calculation for the stability prediction are carried out by applying Floquet theory. The calculated results from these constructed methods demonstrate that the FDM with a second-order Lagrange polynomial is optimal, and further has better computational performance compared with some existing discretization methods. Lastly, the influences of the dynamic parameters on chatter stability are analyzed based on the proposed FDM. When the stiffness and damping ratio increase, the limit cutting depth will be enhanced. The increasing natural frequency not only causes an obvious shift of the lobes to the right, but also raises the limit cutting depth to some extent. These theoretical analyses can guide the prediction and improvement of the chatter stability of a machining system. © 2021, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Delayed term; Dynamic parameter; Interpolation method; Milling stability; Stability lobe diagram","Computation theory; Discrete event simulation; Forecasting; Interpolation; Lagrange multipliers; Milling (machining); Polynomials; Volume measurement; Computational performance; Discretization method; Full discretization; Interpolation schemes; Lagrange polynomials; Stability lobe diagrams; Stability prediction; Stiffness and damping; System stability","","","","","Key Basic Research Project of Natural Science Foundation in Shandong Province, (ZR2018ZB0106); Shandong Province Key Agricultural Project for Application Technology Innovation, (2019JZZY010112); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, NNSF, NNSFC, (51975336); China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201906220122)","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51975336), the Key Science and Technology Innovation Project of Shandong Province (Grant No. 2019JZZY010112), Key Basic Research Project of Natural Science Foundation in Shandong Province (Grant No. ZR2018ZB0106), and China Scholarship Council (Grant No. 201906220122).

The FSS unit cells individually present a three-dimensional structure, whereas collectively these are more like planar FSS. The unit cell substrate has been printed using 3-D printing technique and metallized using copper paint. The 3-D printing offers a degree of freedom to fabricate substrate material in three dimensions. Various designs of unit cell have been studied by fabricating a dual-band FSS which highlights the significance of the dimensional change of the 3-D unit cell over FSS performance. The designed FSS has been fabricated and tested using VNA where test results are found as per desire.

In-situ process monitoring technology offers an excellent opportunity for process understanding and control, which improves the component quality and repeatability of AM. In this study, emission spectroscopy and plume imaging were utilized to monitor and understand the laser-directed energy deposition of Al7075 alloy. Characteristics of plasma were analyzed using spectra and plume image signals. Emission lines of Al I, Mg I, and Cr I observed in spectra signals demonstrated that primary elements in Al7075 were evaporated and excited during the AM process forming a plasma plume. The plasma plume intensity increased significantly as the laser power increasing. The periodic fluctuation of plasma was revealed using plume images, indicating that laser powers inputted into the target surface were unstable due to the laser and plasma interaction. The elemental evaporation and inconsistent laser input are the main challenges for Al7075 AM and are potentially monitored by plasma signals. Methods of signal process and feature extraction for spectra and plume images were developed. Experimental results showed that the aluminum emission spectral energy, the average baseline spectral intensity, and the plume area are practical for rough surface monitoring. Correlations between spectral features and key printing parameters were developed, demonstrating an excellent response of spectra features to the laser power and laser scanning speed. This investigation revealed the potentials and challenges of emission spectroscopy in the in-situ monitoring of laser AM, making progress towards intelligent additive manufacturing. © 2013 IEEE.","Additive manufacturing; directed energy deposition; emission spectroscopy; process monitoring; signal processing","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum compounds; Chromium compounds; Emission spectroscopy; Magnesium compounds; Plasma interactions; Process monitoring; Signal processing; Thermal plumes; Elemental evaporation; Emission spectral; In- situ monitoring; Laser additive manufacturing; Laser scanning speed; Periodic fluctuations; Process understanding; Spectral intensity; Aluminum alloys","","","","","National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, (F050663); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2020YFB1710002)","This work was supported in part by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) under Contract F050663, and in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2020YFB1710002.","Eyers D.R., Potter A.T., Gosling J., Naim M.M., The flexibility of industrial additive manufacturing systems, (In English), Int.

To determine the shared states and failures of all nodes in a fully distributed peer-to-peer system, the appropriate consensus algorithm needs to be selected for each Internet of Things system. In this paper, a novel hierarchical voting-based byzantine fault tolerance (HBFT) consensus algorithm is proposed. The proposed HBFT algorithm utilizes a typical PBFT algorithm hierarchically to guarantee low latency. The message complexity of HBFT shows that our proposed algorithm has better scalability. We also mathematically calculate the optimal number of groups based on the total number of nodes to determine the ratio of allowable faulty nodes per group. In addition, we analyze the reliability of byzantine fault tolerance to compare the reliability of group case with the reliability of non-group case. Finally, we introduce the methods of real-time Blockchain considering the service level agreement (SLA).

In current practice, printing paths are planned from part geometry without considering loading conditions. This paper presents a new method for optimizing printing paths to align with the principal stress field of parts in use. Because of the powerful processing capabilities, for the first time grayscale image was adopted to represent the irregular vector field, which can be robustly processed into sub-regions for generating regular printing paths. Preliminary bending test achieved promising increase in tensile strength compared with conventional methods. © 2021 CIRP","Additive manufacturing; Image processing; Tool path","Aerospace industry; Image processing; Tensile strength; Automotive products; Conventional methods; Current practices; Gray-scale images; Image processing algorithm; Loading condition; Path optimizations; Processing capability; 3D printers","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51805260); National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars, (51925505)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Ref: 51805260 ) and the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (Ref: 51925505 ).","Tekinalp H.L., Kunc V., Velez-Garcia G.M., Duty C.E., Love L.J., Naskar A.K., Blue C.A., Ozcan S., Highly oriented carbon fiber–polymer composites via additive manufacturing, Compos.

In recent years, hybrid production methods are emerging to bridge between the build volume and high throughput of conventional production methods and the design freedom enabled by additive manufacturing. The repeatability of material properties and the quality of the interface between the additive manufactured and wrought material are crucial for the adoption of hybrid manufacturing techniques by the industry. Here, the tensile behavior and fracture toughness of a hybrid Ti-6Al-4V alloy are examined in detail. Ti-6Al-4V pre-forms were built onto a wrought Ti-6Al-4V start-plate and extracted via milling. Compact tension and uniaxial tension specimens extracted from the hybrid pre-forms demonstrated good fracture and properties with no preference for crack growth in neither the AM nor wrought materials. Microstructural characterization revealed a 40 mm transition layer into the wrought material which ends abruptly with no evidence of a gradually decaying heat-affected zone. The hybrid manufacturing approach studied here expands the current limitations of large-scale critical components with fine features and allow such structures to be produced with a higher throughput. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Fracture-toughness; Hybrid manufacturing; Powder bed","3D printers; Additives; Bridges; Fracture toughness; Heat affected zone; Hybrid materials; Ternary alloys; Throughput; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Conventional production methods; Critical component; Current limitation; Hybrid production; Manufacturing techniques; Micro-structural characterization; Structural component; Tensile behaviors; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Israel Institute of Metallurgy; Technion-Israel Institute of Technology; PAZY Foundation, PAZY, (1176); PAZY Foundation, PAZY","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the assistance of the technical staff in the Israel Institute of Metallurgy at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology and the Materials Processing group at Rafael Metal Technology Center for their technical assistance along this work.

Although decellularization has led to a major advancement in bio-ink development, the effects of detergent type, the most important factor in decellularization, are still unclear. In this study, the effects of various detergent types on bio-ink performance were investigated. Porcine liver-derived dECM bio-inks prepared using widely used detergents, including sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), sodium deoxycholate (SDC), Triton X-100 (TX), and TX with ammonium hydroxide (TXA), were characterized in detail. SDS and SDC severely damaged glycosaminoglycan and elastin proteins, TX showed the lowest rate of decellularization, and TXA-based dECM bio-ink possessed the highest ECM content among all bio-inks. Differences in biochemical composition directly affected bio-ink performance, with TXA-dECM bio-ink showing the best performance with respect to gelation kinetics, intermolecular bonding, mechanical properties, and 2D/3D printability. More importantly, cytocompatibility tests using primary mouse hepatocytes also showed that the TXA-dECM bio-ink improved albumin secretion and cytochrome P450 activity by approximately 2.12- and 1.67-fold, respectively, compared with the observed values for other bio-inks. Our results indicate that the detergent type has a great influence on dECM damage and that the higher the dECM content, the better the performance of the bio-ink for 3D bioprinting. © The Author(s) 2021.","3D bioprinting; Bio-ink; decellularization; detergent","3D printers; Ammonium hydroxide; Gelation; Soaps (detergents); Sodium dodecyl sulfate; ammonium hydroxide; chondroitin sulfate; collagen; deoxycholate sodium; detergent; dodecyl sulfate sodium; elastin; glycosaminoglycan; hydrogel; molecular scaffold; triton x 100; 3d bioprinting; Bio-ink; Bioprinting; Decellularization; Decellularized; Extracellular matrices; Performance; Sodium deoxycholate; Sodium dodecyl sulphate; Triton X-100; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; biochemical composition; biocompatibility; bioprinting; decellularization; differential scanning calorimetry; DNA determination; electrospinning; extracellular matrix; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; gelation; histology; immunoturbidimetry; nonhuman; optical density; scanning electron microscopy; shear rate; tensile strength; three dimensional bioprinting; tissue engineering; Sulfur compounds","","ammonium hydroxide, 1336-21-6; chondroitin sulfate, 9007-28-7, 9082-07-9; collagen, 9007-34-5; deoxycholate sodium, 302-95-4; dodecyl sulfate sodium, 151-21-3; elastin, 9007-58-3","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (NRF-2018K1A4A3A01063890, NRF-2020M3H4A1A02084827, NRF-2020R1F1A1075865); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, MEST","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the National R&D Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (No. NRF-2020M3H4A1A02084827 and NRF-2020R1F1A1075865) and the Leading Foreign Research Institute Recruitment Program (No. NRF-2018K1A4A3A01063890) through the National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST).

The SL-SRCKF process contains two innovative steps: 1) it provides the traditional SRCKF with a self-learning ability, which means that navigation system observations can be provided continuously, even during long-term GPS outages; and 2) the relationship between the current Kalman filter gains and the optimal estimation error is established, which means that the optimal estimation accuracy can be improved by error compensation. The superiority of the proposed SL-SRCKF strategy is verified via experimental results and prominent advantages of this approach include: 1) the SL-SRCKF comprises two cycle filtering systems that work in a tightly coupled mode, and this allows more accurate error correction results to be obtained during GPS outages; 2) the system's error prediction ability is effectively improved by introducing a long short-term memory, which provides much better performance than other neural networks, such as random forest regression or the recursive neural network; and 3) under different (30, 60, and 100 s) GPS outage conditions, the long-term stability of SL-SRCKF is much better than that of other error correction approaches.  © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; deep learning (DL); Global Positioning System (GPS)/inertial navigation system (INS); long short-term memory (LSTM); square-root cubature Kalman filter (SRCKF)","Decision trees; Error compensation; Error correction; Kalman filters; Learning systems; Neural networks; Correction approaches; Filtering systems; Hybrid navigation; Long term stability; Optimal estimations; Recursive neural networks; Self-learning ability; Square-root cubature kalman filters; Global positioning system","","","","","Preresearch Field Foundation, (6140518010201); Program for the Top Young Academic Leaders of Higher Learning Institutions of Shanxi; Science Foundation of North University of China, (51821003, XJJ201822); Scientific and Technology Innovation Programs of Higher Education Institutions in Shanxi, (201802084); Weapons and Equipment Joint Foundation, (6141B021305); Young Academic Leaders Foundation in North University of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51705477, 61603353, 61973281); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Aeronautical Science Foundation of China, (2018ZCU0002); Aeronautical Science Foundation of China; Fund for Shanxi Key Subjects Construction","Manuscript received May 20, 2019; revised October 18, 2019 and November 18, 2019; accepted December 17, 2019.

This is the reason for the rapid increase over the last few years in the replacement of conventional alloys (i.e., steel and cast iron) with low-density materials (i.e., aluminum alloys, composites) and in the redesign of components shape in order to remove the unnecessary material (e.g., related to the introduction of additive manufacturing or high-strength materials). Despite this general trend, the use of higher-density metals and massive geometries is still predominant in the production of structural components, especially for heavy vehicles and safety-relevant parts. Aim of the present review is to summarize how this current situation can be overcome. The analysis started with an investigation about the materials that can be used for the production of structural parts, the potential reduction of the component weight and its costs. The scenarios analyzed foreseen by 2030 an improved weight reduction combined with additional cost. Both the parameters increased when moving from medium/small vehicles to luxury vehicles (from -18% to -35% weight and from €3 to €8-10 per kg saved, respectively) as a direct consequence of an increased usage of lighter materials. Then, the research reports some relevant actual applications, which succeeded in the weight reduction of these kind of components. The identified materials and technologies discussed were: advanced high-strength steel, carbon fiber-reinforced polymer, aluminum, additive manufacturing technologies, and alternative joining techniques. © 2021 SAE International","Additive manufacturing;

This reduces the resolution of the AM process, which is typically defined by the deposition nozzle size. If the resolution limitation is not considered when designing for Large-Scale Additive Manufacturing (LSAM), difficulties can arise in the manufacturing process, which may require the adaptation of deposition parameters. This work incorporates the nozzle size constraint into Topology Optimisation (TO) in order to generate optimised designs suitable to the process resolution. This article proposes and compares two methods, which are based on existing TO techniques that enable control of minimum and maximum member size, and of minimum cavity size. The first method requires the minimum and maximum member size to be equal to the deposition nozzle size, thus design features of uniform width are obtained. The second method defines the size of solid members sufficiently small for the resulting structure to resemble a structural skeleton, which can be interpreted as the deposition path. Through filtering and projection techniques, the thin structures are thickened according to the chosen nozzle size. Thus, a topology tailored to the deposition nozzle size is obtained along with a deposition proposal. The methods are demonstrated and assessed using 2D and 3D benchmark problems. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","design for AM; maximum size; Nozzle size; topology optimisation; WAAM","3D printers; Additives; Constrained optimization; Deposition; Nozzles; Topology; Bench-mark problems; Deposition Parameters; Design features; Manufacturing process; Projection techniques; Size constraint; Structural skeletons; Topology optimisation; Nozzle design","","","","","Consortium des Équipements de Calcul Intesif; INTERREG V A Grande R?gion; INTERREG V A Grande Région; Scientific Research Fund of Belgium; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","Funding text 1: The corresponding author acknowledges the research project FAFil (Fabrication Additive laser par dépôt de Fil), funded by INTERREG V A Grande Région and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).

This is caused by the ability of print a small part in a short time (rapid prototyping), but also because of the available materials. This is important because by using 3D printing, a specialized element is made for a specific apply. Compared with traditional production methods, such as turning and milling, 3D printing gives a wider possibility of making specific product patterns, thanks to which this method gained support and became a competitive one. Hence, the designing and manufacturing process based on it is more and more often referred as the “design-driven manufacturing”. This method gives the possibility of making personalized elements or a larger number of product variants, but also gives the possibility of manufacturing complete elements in one run. The article describes the possibilities of using 3D printing in the production of unusual elements in a uncertain situations. © 2021, ModTech Publishing House.

Photo-cross-linkable alumina slurries were designed using a partial complex of polyethyleneimine and oleic acid (PEI-OA) as reactive polymer dispersants and multifunctional acrylates (MA) as monomers. The effects of the processing parameters, such as oleic acid contents, MA contents, particle contents, and particle sizes, on photocuring properties were systematically investigated. We found that the reactive amine sites of PEI-OA attached to particles and MA volume concentrations in the liquid phase were the most dominant factors to improve the photocuring properties. Therefore, a slurry composed of larger alumina particles with higher solid contents and PEI-OA with lower OA contents was more favorable for achieving photocuring under reduced MA content. The designed photocurable slurry was then applied to ceramic stereolithography using optical fiber. 3D alumina green parts were drawn by passing blue laser beam through an optical fiber in a droplet of photocuring slurry and dense sintered alumina were successfully fabricated by rapid drying (<10 min) and debinding (<1 h) without any structural collapse. © 2021 The Society of Powder Technology Japan","Additive manufacturing; Ceramics; Optical fiber; Photocurable slurry","Aluminum oxide; Green manufacturing; Laser beams; Monomers; Monounsaturated fatty acids; Oleic acid; Optical fiber fabrication; Optical fibers; Stereolithography; Textile fibers; Alumina particles; Ceramic stereolithographies; Multi-functional acrylate; Particle content; Polyethyleneimine; Processing parameters; Structural collapse; Volume concentration; Sintered alumina","","","","","JSPS, (18H01704)","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI [grant number JP18H01704].

The nature of the molten metal flow depends on the material properties, process parameters, and powder-bed particles, etc., and may result in potentially significant variations along a laser scanning path. This study investigates the formation of transient and steady-state zones through a single-track L-PBF experiment using Inconel 625 powder. Single tracks with lengths of 1 mm and 2 mm were fabricated using 195 W laser power and scan speeds of 400 mm/s or 800 mm/s. The surface morphology of the track was analyzed using a white light interferometer (WLI), and an individual single track can be divided into three distinct zones based on the track width and height. The initial transient region has a wider and taller solidified track geometry, the region near the end of a scan has a tapered profile with a decreasing track width and height, while the steady-state region in the middle has a smaller variation in the width and height. A mesoscale numerical model was further developed using FLOW-3D to examine the formation of the transient and steady-state zones. At the start of a scan, strong flow occurs outward and backward, leading to the formation of a wider track with a bump. As the scan continues, the thermal gradient stabilizes, leading to a steady state, which resulted in a very small fluctuation in the width. Furthermore, the tapered end of the scan track is due to the half-lemniscate shape of the melt pool during laser scanning. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Additive manufacturing; Laser powder bed fusion; Numerical modelling; Transient region","Liquid metals; Morphology; Powder metals; Surface morphology; Laser scanning; Mesoscale numerical model; Molten metal flow; Process parameters; Small fluctuation; Steady-state regions; Transient region; White-light interferometer; Laser materials processing","","","","","Advanced Manufacturing Program, (1921263); National Science Foundation, NSF","This research is partially supported by NSF , Advanced Manufacturing Program (Award # 1921263).","Yadroitsev I., Et al., Single track formation in selective laser melting of metal powders, J Mater Process Technol, 210, 12, pp. 1624-1631, (2010); Dilip J., Et al., A short study on the fabrication of single track deposits in SLM and characterization, Solid freeform fabrication symposium, (2016); Gong H., Et al., Melt pool characterization for selective laser melting of Ti-6Al-4V pre-alloyed powder, Solid freeform fabrication symposium., (2014); Shrestha S., Chou K., A numerical study on the keyhole formation during laser powder bed fusion process, J Manuf Sci Eng, (2019); Aboulkhair N.T., Et al., On the formation of AlSi10Mg single tracks and layers in selective laser melting: microstructure and nano-mechanical properties, J Mater Process Technol, 230, pp. 88-98, (2016); Volpp J., Brueckner F., Kaplan A.F., Track geometry variations in selective laser melting processes, J Laser Appl, 31, 2, (2019); Li R., Et al., Balling behavior of stainless steel and nickel powder during selective laser melting process, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 59, 9-12, pp. 1025-1035, (2012); Matthews M.J., Et al., Denudation of metal powder layers in laser powder bed fusion processes, Acta Mater, 114, pp. 33-42, (2016); Gunenthiram V., Et al., Analysis of laser–melt pool–powder bed interaction during the selective laser melting of a stainless steel, (2017); Bidare P., Et al., Fluid and particle dynamics in laser powder bed fusion, Acta Mater, 142, pp. 107-120, (2018); Cunningham R., Et al., Keyhole threshold and morphology in laser melting revealed by ultrahigh-speed x-ray imaging, Science, 363, 6429, pp. 849-852, (2019); Bertoli U.S., Et al., On the limitations of volumetric energy density as a design parameter for selective laser melting, Mater Des, 113, pp. 331-340, (2017); Khairallah S.A., Et al., Laser powder-bed fusion additive manufacturing: physics of complex melt flow and formation mechanisms of pores, spatter, and denudation zones, Acta Mater, 108, pp. 36-45, (2016); Panwisawas C., Et al., Mesoscale modelling of selective laser melting: thermal fluid dynamics and microstructural evolution, Comput Mater Sci, 126, pp. 479-490, (2017); Shrestha S., Chou K., Single track scanning experiment in laser powder bed fusion process, Procedia Manuf, 26, pp. 857-864, (2018); Meier C., Et al., Modeling and characterization of cohesion in fine metal powders with a focus on additive manufacturing process simulations, Powder Technol, 343, pp. 855-866, (2019); Wischeropp T.M., Et al., Measurement of actual powder layer height and packing density in a single layer in selective laser melting, Addit Manuf, (2019); Capriccioli A., Frosi P., Multipurpose ANSYS FE procedure for welding processes simulation, Fusion Eng Des, 84, 2, pp. 546-553, (2009); King W.E., Et al., Observation of keyhole-mode laser melting in laser powder-bed fusion additive manufacturing, J Mater Process Technol, 214, 12, pp. 2915-2925, (2014)","S.

The accuracy of the fabricated components depends on various process parameters. Process parameters used in this investigation are layer thickness (150, 200 and 250 µm), infill pattern (linear, hexagonal and star fill), raster angle (0°, 45° and 90°) and infill density (40, 60 and 80%). Linear and radial dimension of knuckle joint are selected for the response factor. Design/methodology/approach: The experiments are design by using response surface methodology (RSM). Four design variables at three levels are used to examine their influence on percentage error in linear dimension and radial dimension of the component. A prototype Knuckle joint is selected as component. Minitab-14 software is used for the design of experiments. Findings: Experimental measure data is analyzed by using “smaller is better” quality characteristics. A regression model for the forecasting of percentage error in linear and radial dimension is developed. The developed model is within precision range. The optimum level of process for linear and radial dimensions are obtained: layer thickness of 150 µm, Infill pattern of linear, Raster angle of 90° and infill density of 40%. Research limitations/implications: It proves that both the mathematical model is significant and can be able to approximate the desired output value close to the accurate dimensions. While comparing the calculated F-values for both linear and radial dimension with the standard table (F-table, 0.05), it is found that at the given set of degree of freedom the standard F-values (6.61) is lower for that regression, linear, square and interaction source of the predicted model, for which p-values have already less than 0.05. It is desirable for significant process parameters. Practical implications: The dimensional accuracy with respect to average percentage error of FDM produced knuckle joint is successfully examined. The effect of process parameters, namely, layer thickness, infill pattern, raster angle and infill density on average percentage error was investigated by RSM and analysis of variance table. Social implications: The novelty of this work lies in the fact that only few studies are available in archival literature related to influence of these process parameters on percentage error in linear and radial dimension for Polycarbonate (PC) material. Originality/value: The novelty of this work lies in the fact only few studies are available in archival literature related to influence of these process parameters on percentage error in linear and radial dimension for Polycarbonate (PC) material. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing;

However, case studies demonstrating new algorithms are largely individualized, making algorithm performance difficult to compare directly. In addition, the effort and expertise required to implement case studies in real or simulated buildings limits rapid prototyping potential. Therefore, this paper presents the Building Optimization Testing Framework (BOPTEST) and associated software for simulation-based benchmarking of building HVAC control algorithms. A containerized run-time environment (RTE) enables rapid, repeatable deployment of common building emulators representing different system types. Emulators use Modelica to represent realistic physical dynamics, embed baseline control, and enable overwriting supervisory and local-loop control signals. Finally, a common set of key performance indicators are calculated within the RTE and reported to the user. This paper details the design and implementation of software and demonstrates its usage to benchmark a Model Predictive Control strategy. © This material is published by permission of [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory], operated by [The Regents of the University of California] for the [U.S. Department of Energy] under Contract No. [DE-AC02-05CH11231].

The pressure at the touchpoint, which is the interface between the residual limb with natural skin and the prosthetic limb socket with a polymeric material, should be monitored precisely when fabricating the comfort fit. Even a small volume or shape discrepancy between the residual limb and prosthetic limb sock causes several problems in the residual limb, such as skin breakage, tissue irritation, and associated pain. Volume variations of the residual limb due to squeezing by a prosthetic limb sock result in pressure changes that can be detected using a pressure sensor. In this study, the interface pressures between the residual limb and prosthetic upper-limb socket were obtained using a 3D printed capacitive pressure sensor. An upper-limb prosthetic socket and capacitive pressure sensor were fabricated using a dual nozzle 3D Fused Deposition Modelling technique. Polylactic acid, polylactic acid-carbon black compound, and polyurethane were used as the personalized upperlimb socket and sensing electrode, and substrate material, respectively. The as-fabricated sensors were embedded into the sock wall, and their sensing properties were characterized. For a case study, the sensor-embedded sockets were worn on an amputee's residual upper-limb to characterize empirically the contact pressure occurring at the interfaces. A weight was attached to the end of the limb socket to examine the effects of weight on the local pressures acting on the residual upper limb. The observed interface pressures and pressure distribution at the interface can provide valuable information to clinicians and developers that can guide fit improvements. © 2021.

However, due to advancements in additive manufacturing, new capabilities have replaced traditional methods of manufacturing. In this paper, we present a soft 3D-printed robotic hand actuated by custom-made coiled shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators. The hand uses additive manufacturing of flexible thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) material, which allows flexing at the joint and hence eliminates the need for additional assembly. Here, we present the full characteristics of the robotic hand such as object grasping categorized by size and weight from the ARAT kit and others. The robotic hand is 425 mm in length, weighs 235 g and is able to operate at a frequency of 0.125 Hz without active cooling. It can grasp an object of 55–81 mm widths, weighing up to 133 g, while consuming an average power of 7.82 W. We also show the time domain response of our custom-made coiled SMA to different current inputs, and its corresponding force and displacement. The current design yields a lightweight and low cost artificial hand with significantly simplified manufacturing for applications in robotics and prosthetics. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the optimal Al-grading structure of these SL EBLs remains unclear owing to a lack of systematic investigation. The present work addresses this issue by applying EBL composed of alternating half-peak, single-peak, and double-peak p-type AlxGa1-xN/GaN SL structures with varying values of x ranging from 0.05 to 0.15 in 0.05 step increments. Simulation analysis is employed to obtain the internal quantum efficiency (IQE), energy band diagrams, polarization compensation factor, hole concentration, and electron concentration of GaN-based UV LEDs with three different SL-EBL structures. The results obtained at an injection current of 200 mA demonstrate that UV LEDs with double-peak SL-EBL structures provide the maximum IQE, which is 38% greater than that of devices employing the conventional EBL in simulation experiment. This SL-EBL is demonstrated to improve the hole injection and electron overflow performance of GaN-based UV LEDs owing to the polarization charge and lattice mismatch at the p-AlxGa1-xN/GaN interfaces. The reduced Al composition on the p-GaN side reduces the potential barrier of hole injection. Moreover, the predicted increase in the IQE of GaN-based UV LEDs with the optimal SL-EBL is verified experimentally.  © 2013 IEEE.","Light emitting diodes; superlattice electron blocking layers; ultraviolet sources","Electron injection; Electrons; Gallium nitride; Grading; III-V semiconductors; Lattice mismatch; Light emitting diodes; Polarization; Structural optimization; Compensation factor; Electron blocking layer; Electron concentration; Energy-band diagram; GaN-based light-emitting diodes; Internal quantum efficiency; Polarization charges; Superlattice layers; Gallium alloys","","","","","Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, (201805010001, 2016B090927009, 2016B090927002); UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (106167); Special Projects in Key Fields of Artificial Intelligence in Colleges and Universities of Guangdong Province, (2019KZDZX1042); Special Projects in Universities’ Key Fields of Guangdong Province, (2020ZDZX2002); Project of Innovation in Colleges and Universities of Guangdong Province, (2019KTSCX084)","This work was supported in part by the Guangdong Science and Technology Project under Grant 2016B090927009, Grant 2016B090927002, and Grant 201805010001; in part by the Special Projects in Universities\u2019 Key Fields of Guangdong Province under Grant 2020ZDZX2002; in part by the Special Projects in Key Fields of Artificial Intelligence in Colleges and Universities of Guangdong Province under Grant 2019KZDZX1042; and in part by the Project of Innovation in Colleges and Universities of Guangdong Province under Grant 2019KTSCX084.","Song K., Mohseni M., Taghipour F., Application of ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) for water disinfection: A review, Water Res, 94, pp. 341-349, (2016); Jain B., Velpula R.T., Velpula S., Nguyen H.-D., Nguyen H.P.T., Enhanced hole transport in AlGaN deep ultraviolet light-emitting diodes using a double-sided step graded superlattice electron blocking layer, J.

However, currently available SL based depth sensors are sensitive to imaging noises, which severely limits the performance of subsequent advanced vision tasks. In this letter, we propose a robust and practical SL illumination pattern coding method based on epipolar geometry. The proposed pattern can effectively alleviate coding redundancy in traditional global random speckle SL patterns and make the stereo matching more robust to noise. Meanwhile, this coding strategy supplies sufficient non-local similar blocks, which inspires us to propose a uni-direction block-stacking 3D filtering algorithm to further improve the 3D imaging quality. To verify the proposed algorithms, we developed a prototype using the off-the-shelf projector and camera. Both simulation and real scene experimental results show that the proposed methods can achieve high-quality 3D imaging performance under different noisy conditions.  © 1994-2012 IEEE.","epipolar geometry; illumination pattern; noise correction; Structured light","Imaging systems; Optical projectors; Coding redundancies; Epipolar geometry; Filtering algorithm; Illumination patterns; Noisy conditions; Stereo matching; Structured Light; Three dimensional (3-D) imaging; Stereo image processing","","","","","","","Du Q., Liu R., Guan B., Pan Y., Sun S., Stereo-matching network for structured light, IEEE Signal Process.

Hence, we propose to design a trust-based multi-level secure routing protocol (RP) for authentication and authorisation (TMSR-AA) in WMN. The path trust value (PTV) is calculated along the route from these trust tables. Hence, the multi-level security (MLS) is used to transmit the data by categorising into different security levels (SLs). The packets transmitted in the network are assigned an SL based on the type of data, a mesh-router with a specific SL to send packets only at the same-level or at lower-level during transmission. The performance of the 'TMSR-AA-WMN' protocol upholds a trust table with its neighbouring nodes and routing protocol for authentication and authorisation. The 'TMSR-AA-WMN' is compared with 'ESR' protocol in terms of packet-delivery-ratio, packet-drop, delay, computational over-head, communication over-head and detection-accuracy.

The present study investigates the relationship between the bond strength of the dental porcelain to selective-laser-melted (SLM) titanium and the temperature of the titanium’s pre-oxidation. The SLM Ti-6Al-4V substrates were airborne-particle abraded and either left to passivate in air at room temperature (control) or pre-oxidized in a furnace under vacuum conditions (10 kPa) at temperatures of 300, 600, 750, or 800 °C. The surface characteristics were determined using contact profilometry to measure the profile roughness (Ra), atomic force microscopy for the surface roughness (S a) and Auger electron spectroscopy for the thickness of the oxide scale. Dental porcelain was applied to the metal substrates and the titanium-ceramic bond was assessed according to the ISO standard 9693-1:2012. The metal-ceramic interfaces were analyzed with scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy. The R a and S a values showed a strong positive correlation with the pre-oxidation temperature. The oxide scales covering the titanium surfaces thickened markedly at temperatures of 750 °C and above. However, the bond strength was negatively correlated with the pre-oxidation temperature. Room-temperature passivation in air following the airborne-particle abrasion of the SLM titanium resulted in a titanium-ceramic bond that is well above the ISO 9693-1:2012 recommended minimum value for metal-ceramic systems. Thus, no pre-oxidation of SLM titanium frameworks is necessary prior to the application/firing of porcelain. © 2021 The Author(s).

Reimagining the way IoT connectivity services are presented by combining AWS cloud technology with mobile connectivity offers rapid prototyping to help connect devices natively over Wi-Fi. For this, the MQTT communication protocol is used to interact with the IoT device and exchange data, which allows controlling the basic functions of a sensor node. The installation is realized through a software development kit (SDK), which allows the creation of an application for Android devices. This solution gives the option to integrate together, improving the connectivity of the IoT system. The results enable board logging and network configuration, and can also be used to control the IoT device.

Due to the limitation of the inherent energy resolution of the detector itself, the accuracy of X-ray fluorescence analysis is difficult to be greatly improved. In some applications, even if the semiconductor detector with the best energy resolution is used, the characteristic peaks of different elements cannot be completely separated. Therefore, greatly improving the energy resolution of the detection system is a hot issue in the existing research field. To solve these problems, this paper analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of the traditional MCA (multichannel analyzer) and SLA (seeds local averaging) algorithm and proposes an ISLA (improved seeds local averaging) algorithm based on mathematical statistics. In the section of theoretical derivation, the principle of ISLA algorithm is described, whose theoretical characteristics and spectral results with different parameters are derived and simulated. In the application effect evaluation, the spectrum obtained by each method is analyzed in detail. Simulation and experimental results show that the spectrum obtained by SLA algorithm has a smaller full width at half maximum than that obtained by MCA, but the seed average process in SLA algorithm also reduces its counting rate. The optimized ISLA algorithm can not only effectively reduce the full width at half maximum of the spectral line and sharpen the spectrum peak but also compensate for the loss of the count rate of SLA algorithm.

The authors are involved in a project developing a multi-robot material extrusion 3D printer to print a gravity separation spiral (GSS), an instrument used in the mining industry to separate mineral slurry into different density components. Compared with traditional mould-based manufacturing, this new additive manufacturing method will significantly reduce manufacturing tooling costs, improve the customisation to enable the production of bespoke GSS that each processes different minerals and reduce worker exposure to hazardous materials. Slicing and printing large-scale helical objects in conventional horizontal layer addition would result in an unreasonable amount of waste material from support structures, and poor surface quality due to step-wise bumps. This paper presents a novel slicing algorithm using concentric vertical ray lines to slice objects radially, enabling layers to be deposited progressively in the same fashion. This method can be applied in large-scale additive manufacturing where objects are printed by a robot in a radial direction, which is different from layered vertical printing in conventional additive systems. An example GSS is sliced to generate motion plans for a print head affixed to the end effector of a robot arm. Then through simulations, it is shown how a robot’s expected manipulability measure can be used to predict and ensure the successful completion of the print. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Advanced manufacturing; Manipulability; Slicing algorithm","Additives; Data Analytics; End effectors; Industrial robots; Industry 4.0; Metadata; Mineral industry; Robot programming; Advanced manufacturing; Conventional additives; Different densities; Industrial revolutions; Manipulability measures; Sensor technologies; Slicing algorithms; Support structures; 3D printers","","","","","Harvard and Michael Behrens; The Commonwealth of Australia’s Department of Industry, Innovation and Science; University of Technology Sydney, UTS; Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, Australian Government","Funding text 1: This research is supported by UTS, The Commonwealth of Australia’s Department of Industry, Innovation and Science (Innovative Manufacturing CRC Ltd) and Downer, via its subsidiary Mineral Technologies. ; Funding text 2: Thank you to Rapido, in particular, Herv?

A kind of diamond lattice structure unit is designed by imitating the natural method based on Design for Additive Manufacturing of mechanical parts. The mathematical model of the relative density and mechanical properties of the unit are established, and the relationship between the two is obtained, which is verified by simulations; then the relatively uniform results are obtained. The variable density hypothesis of diamond lattice structure is proposed, the methods of simulations and compression tests are used to verify the hypothesis, and the results show that the variable density structure with the density of the filling element decreasing gradually with the stress point as the center has better compression performance and concurrently verify the correctness and applicability of the equivalent modulus of elasticity mathematical model. The results of this study can be applied to the solid sandwich filling of pressure mechanical parts, and the stress density matching relationship can be carried out to further specific design.  © 2021 Xuan Yin et al.","","3D printers; Additives; Aerospace industry; Compression testing; Crystal lattices; Density (specific gravity); Design for manufacturability; Diamonds; Filling; Compression performance; Density matching; Diamond lattice structure; Lattice structures; Material complexity; Mechanical structures; Relative density; Variable density; Structural design","","","","","","","Chu C., Graf G., Rosen D.W., Design for additive manufacturing of cellular structure, Computer-Aided Design and Applications, 5, 5, pp. 686-696, (2008); Rosen D.W., Research supporting principles for design for Additive Manufacturing, Virtual and Physical Prototyping, 9, 4, pp. 225-232, (2014); Thompson M.K., Moroni G., Vaneker T., Design for additive manufacturing: Trends, opportunities, considerations, and constraints, CIRP Annals, 65, 2, pp. 737-760, (2016); Helou M., Kara S., Design, analysis and manufacturing of lattice structures: An overview, International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing, 31, 3, pp. 243-261, (2018); Nguyen J., Sang-In P., Rosen D., Heuristic optimization method for cellular structure design of light weight components, International Journal of Precision Engineering and Manufacturing, 14, 6, pp. 1071-1078, (2013); Yang L., Experimental-assisted design development for an octahedral cellular structure using additive manufacturing, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 21, 2, pp. 168-176, (2015); Yang L., Harrysson O., Cormier D., West H., Gong H., Stucker B., Additive Manufacturing of metal cellular structures: Design and fabrication, The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society, 67, 3, pp. 608-615, (2015); Vongbunyong S., Kara S., Development of software tool for cellular structure integration for additive manufacturing, Procedia CIRP, 48, pp. 489-494, (2016); Araujo H., Leite M., Ribeiro A.R., Deus A.M., Reis L., Fatima Vaz M., The effect of geometry on the flexural properties of cellular core, structures, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part L: Journal of Materials: Design and Applications, 3, pp. 338-347, (2019); Monteiro J.G., Sardinha M., Alves F., Evaluation of the effect of core lattice topology on the properties of sandwich panels produced by additive manufacturing, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part L: Journal of Materials: Design and Applications, pp. 1-13, (2020); Ahmed Y.H., The Development of Lightweight Cellular Structures for Metal Additive Manufacturing, (2013); Kadkhodapour J., Montazerian H., Darabi A.C., Failure mechanisms of additively manufactured porous biomaterials: Effects of porosity and type of unit cell, Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials, 50, pp. 180-191, (2015); Li Y., Jahr H., Pavanram P., Additively manufactured functionally graded biodegradable porous iron, Acta Biomaterialia, 96, pp. 646-661, (2019); Panda B.N., Design and Development of Cellular Structure for Additive Manufacturing, (2015); Song G.-H., Jing S.-K., Zhao F.-L., Wang Y.-D., Xing H., Zhou J.-T., Design optimization of irregular cellular structure for additive manufacturing, Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering, 30, pp. 1184-1192, (2017); Zhao F.-L., Jing S.-K., Liu C.-Y., Variable density cellular structure design method base on local relative density mapping, Journal of Mechanical Engineering, 54, 19, pp. 121-128, (2018); Liu J.-H., Wang D.-P., Xu W.-T., Design method of honeycomb structure generation for additive manufacturing, Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems, 23, 10, pp. 2101-2107, (2017); Liao Z.-Y., Wang Y.-J., Wang S.-T., Graded-density lattice structure optimization design based on topology optimization, Journal of Mechanical Engineering, 55, 8, pp. 65-72, (2019); Liu H.-W., Mechanics of Materials, (2004); Yu Y.-X., Reduced moment of inertia of variable cross-section members, Hoisting and Conveying Machinery, 2, pp. 75-78, (1980); Gibson J., Ashby M.F., Cellular Solids:Structure and Properties, (1997)","W.

Chemical EOR is a promising technology to boost the production of old reservoirs with the aid of surfactants and polymers. Thus, the production of low-cost EOR surfactants from local resources with acceptable performance is highly attractive. The objective of the present work was to demonstrate the development of low-cost lignosulfonate surfactant production from kraft black liquor (BL). First, lignin was isolated from black liquor using a novel CO2 bubbling technique, followed by addition of coagulants. Next, sodium lignosulfonate (SLS) was synthesized from the resulting lignin, followed by formulation of SLS with octanol and palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) soap to obtain an ultralow interfacial tension (IFT) surfactant. The initial IFT value of the SLS solution was already high at 0.7 mN/m. After formulation, the composition SLS:PFAD soap:octanol = 70:22:8 (wt%) improved the IFT value to 3.1 10-3 mN/m. An ultralow IFT in the range of 10-3 mN/m as achieved here fulfills the required IFT value for EOR surfactant. © 2021 Published by ITB Institute for Research and Community Services, ISSN: 2337-5779,.","Black liquor; EOR surfactant; Formulation; IFT; Lignin; Sodium lingo-sulfonate","Costs; Fatty Acids; Lignosulfonates; Liquids; Oil; Production; Surfactants; Costs; Enhanced recovery; Fatty acids; Lignin; Sodium; Black liquor; Enhanced oil recovery surfactant; Enhanced-oil recoveries; Formulation; Interfacial tension values; Lignosulfonates; Sodium lignosulfonates; Sodium lingo-sulphonate; Sulphonates; Ultralow interfacial tension; Surface active agents","","","","","Department of Chemical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Petronas; Universitas Gadjah Mada, UGM","PT.

In this study, by using first-principles calculations we propose new PbFCl-type ternary structures of single layers (SLs) and double layers (DLs), namely KAB (A = Cu, Au and B = S, Se). The results indicate that SLs and DLs of KAB are direct band gap semiconductors, ranging from 0.5 eV to 1.4 eV. More importantly, electron mobilities of KCuS, KAuS and KCuSe are larger than 104 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the superiority of optical absorption during visible light region reveals a potential application prospect in photoelectric devices. These findings provide alternative candidates for the application in photoelectric materials and are conductive to understanding the intrinsic properties and potentials of new-type 2D materials. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carrier mobility; First-principles calculations; Photoelectric material; Photoelectric properties","Calculations; Energy gap; Gold compounds; Hall mobility; Hole mobility; Light absorption; Optical properties; Photoelectric devices; Photoelectricity; Selenium compounds; Application prospect; Direct band gap semiconductors; First-principles calculation; Intrinsic property; Semiconducting materials; Ternary structure; Two Dimensional (2 D); Visible light region; Copper compounds","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11804116, 61571210, 62071200); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, (ZR2018MA035, ZR2019MA041); Taishan Scholar Project of Shandong Province, (ts20190939)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.62071200, 61571210, 11804116) and Taishan Scholar Project of Shandong Province (ts20190939) and the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (Grant No. ZR2018MA035 and ZR2019MA041).","Novoselov K.S., Et al., Electric field effect in atomically thin carbon films, Science, 306, pp. 666-669, (2004); Asadollah B., Graphene-like BC<sub>6</sub>N single-layer: tunable electronic and magnetic properties via thickness, gating, topological defects, and adatom/molecule, Physica E, 118, (2020); Asadollah B., Et al., Graphene hetero-multilayer on layered platinum mineral jacutingaite (Pt<sub>2</sub>HgSe<sub>3</sub>): van der Waals heterostructures with novel optoelectronic and thermoelectric performances, J.

SBs are host to a number of devices and technologies capable of providing residential flexibility in order to maintain acceptable operating conditions within the distribution system. A prevalent class of devices with significant potential for flexibility provision are shiftable loads (SLs), which represent a large amount of potential SB-provided flexibility. However, the accurate modelling of SLs within the multi-period optimal power flow (MP-OPF) framework results in complex non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems. For realistic feeders, MINLP problems are intractable and hence require some heuristic form of circumvention. This work evaluates the limitations of the MINLP formulation and proposes new practical alternatives, namely a flexible NLP approximation and a multi-faceted heuristic algorithm. The proposed approaches are generic and applicable for any problem size or type of SL, while they are shown to work efficiently, both speed-wise and solution-quality-wise, outperforming state-of-the-art MINLP solvers. A simple scoring and ranking scheme is also proposed in order to make a direct comparison between the different approaches. © 2020","mixed-integer nonlinear programming; multi-period optimal power flow; residential flexibility; shiftable loads; smart buildings","Acoustic generators; Approximation algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Integer programming; Nonlinear programming; Distribution systems; Heuristic approach; Large amounts; Mixed integer non-linear programming problems; Operating condition; Optimal power flows; Solution quality; State of the art; Electric load flow","","","","","Luxembourg National Research Fund; Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg, FNR, (C18/SR/12676686)","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the funding from the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR) in the framework of the gENESiS project (C18/SR/12676686). ; Funding text 2: The authors acknowledge the funding from the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR) in the framework of the gENESiS project (C18/SR/12676686).","Amin S., Wollenberg B., “Toward a smart grid: power delivery for the 21st century”, IEEE Power Energy Mag., 3, 5, pp. 34-41, (2012); Avramidis I., Evangelopoulos V., Georgilakis P., Hatziargyriou N., “Demand side flexibility schemes for facilitating the high penetration of residential distributed energy resources”, IET Gener.

WAAM is characterized by its ability to manage various metallic materials and high deposition speed. However, its shape accuracy is lower than that of its accumulation via other AM processes and finishing is required as a post-process. In addition, accumulations by AM composed of metal have a complicated thermal history owing to repeated melting and rapid solidification. Consequently, dendritic growth occurs in the microstructure of its accumulation using SUS316L austenitic stainless steel. Therefore, compared with equigranular structures, the mechanical properties of stainless steel, such as ductility and yield strength, are anisotropic. Hence, we herein propose a new system that combines wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) and finishing processing systems. In this method, finishing is performed by the rotating tool when the molten metal solidifies. Experiments using the new system are performed to suppress an anisotropic microstructure by the accumulation of WAAM. As a rotary tool, a cutting tool and a friction stir burnishing (FSB) tool are used. Microstructure observation and X-ray diffraction analysis are performed to evaluate the anisotropy of the accumulation. Using the new system, dendritic growth can be suppressed in an accumulation. By applying the abovementioned simultaneous processing system to the outermost layer of WAAM deposition, improvement in fatigue strength via surface modification and simplification of the finishing process are expected.  © 2021 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.","Cutting; Directed energy deposition; Finishing process; Friction stir burnishing; Wire and arc additive manufacturing; X-ray diffraction analysis","3D printers; Additives; Deposition; Friction stir welding; Liquid metals; Rapid solidification; Textures; Wire; X ray powder diffraction; Dendritic growth; Directed energy; Directed energy deposition; Energy depositions; Finishing process; Friction stir; Friction stir burnishing; Manufacturing IS; Processing systems; Wire and arc additive manufacturing; Friction","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (JP19K14858)","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP19K14858.","Alcisto J., Enriquez A., Garcia H., Hinkson S., Steelman T., Silverman E., Valdovino P., Gigerenzer H., Foyos J., Ogren J., Dorey J., Karg K., McDonald T., Es-Said E.

In this paper, on-line device simulator nanoMOS using NEGF with finite difference method (FDM) discretization is used to obtain current-voltage (I-V) graph. The simulated on-state current is compared with the calculated and plotted using freeware Scilab code without including NEGF with FDM method to demonstrate the flexibility and accuracy of NEGF with FDM method. Accuracy of 92% is achieved. The difference in due to output resistance at saturation region of I-V curve. Also, this quantum transport model is compared with two others electron transport models derived through Boltzmann statistics along with Einstein relationship, one with high drain bias while other with traditional MOSFET model with ballistic mobility. After analysis, these two approximated equations show 0.87 and 8.8 times, respectively, matches against simulated value. Obviously, nano-MOSFET under high drain bias is closely matched with the quantum model. The traditional MOSFET with ballistic mobility is suitable for very-short-channel length devices (like DG nano-MOSFET) and III-V channel materials with very high-real mobility devices. © 2021 The Authors.","Conventional model; Current-voltage; Nano-MOSFET; NEGF; Quantum transport","","","","","","","","Ren Z., Nanoscale MOSFETs: Physics, simulation and design, (2001); Baldo M., Introduction to Nanoelectronics, (2011); Atamuratov A.

This means that the design validation stage is often challenging, considering it is based on an ideal Computer Aided Design (CAD) model that is not truly representative, since the AM part will be different in terms of dimensional accuracy and surface finish. Previous studies have relied on the design of surface textures that are independent of the overhang angle, or techniques based on directly using X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) data. In this paper, a new technique for designing surface texture on the CAD of lattices has been investigated and correlated with areal surface roughness parameters. After extracting areal surface parameters from the XCT data of the lattice, the method allowed for the design of this surface texture on the part CAD taking in consideration if its up skin or down skin, without using XCT data as the main input. By applying this method, it is possible to obtain a lattice CAD model with a designed surface texture and geometry that is more representative of the actual AM lattice. The mean deviation between the CAD model with the designed surface and the XCT was a third of the one between the XCT and the initial CAD. The proposed method allows for designing and replicating LPBF AM surfaces on the CAD of a lattice, taking into consideration the dimensional deviation caused by AM surfaces, especially on overhangs. Assuming that an LPBF AM process is stable and produces approximately the same AM surface, this method can be used to predict the geometry of a lattice, providing a cost-effective and efficient methodology that minimizes the time needed for design validation. © 2020 The Authors","Computer aided design (CAD); Defect modelling; Lattice structures; Metrology; Surface topography; X-ray computed tomography","Additives; Computerized tomography; Cost effectiveness; Geometry; Structural design; Surface roughness; Textures; Topography; Computer aided design models; Design validation; Dimensional accuracy; Dimensional deviation; Lattice structures; Surface geometries; Surface roughness parameters; X-ray computed tomography; Computer aided design","","","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, LLNL, (DE-AC52–07NA27344, LDRD-20-SI-001, LLNL-JRNL-812397); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/P006930/1)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the UK’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) funding of the Future Metrology Hub (Grant Ref: EP/P006930/1 ).

In the design of reinforced concrete structures, the Ultimate Limit State (ULS) and the Serviceability Limit State (SLS) must be checked. Therefore, this paper presents an optimization scheme for reinforced concrete plane frames, in which the objective is to minimize the cost of structures for three cases of constraints: the first is related to ULS and SLS; the second refers only to the ULS; and the third is related only to the SLS. Computational routines for checking limit states of beams and columns are implemented in MATLAB, following the requirements of the Brazilian code. Structural analyses are performed by using the MASTAN2 software, taking into account geometric nonlinearities and a simplified physical nonlinearity method. The objective function considers the cost of concrete, reinforcement and formwork, and the optimization problems are solved by genetic algorithms. Two numerical examples of frames are presented. Regarding the optimal characteristics related to each type of limit state, it is noted that the beams and columns tend to have larger and more reinforced cross sections in the case of the ULS. Even so, optimal structures related to the ULS often do not satisfy SLS and vice versa, which indicates that the optimal characteristics related to each limit state may be different. In addition, it is observed that the SLS is less restrictive than ULS. © 2021, IBRACON - Instituto Brasileiro do Concreto.

However, suitable synthetic and stimuli-responsive bioinks are underrepresented in this context. In this work, we described a hybrid system of nanoclay Laponite XLG and thermoresponsive block copolymer poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline)-b-poly(2-n-propyl-2-oxazine) (PMeOx-b-PnPrOzi) as a novel biomaterial ink and discussed its critical properties relevant for extrusion-based bioprinting, including viscoelastic properties and printability. The hybrid hydrogel retains the thermogelling properties but is strengthened by the added clay (over 5 kPa of storage modulus and 240 Pa of yield stress). Importantly, the shear-thinning character is further enhanced, which, in combination with very rapid viscosity recovery (~ 1 s) and structure recovery (~ 10 s), is highly beneficial for extrusion-based 3D printing. Accordingly, various 3D patterns could be printed with markedly enhanced resolution and shape fidelity compared to the biomaterial ink without added clay.

Contemporary strategies used in 3D tissue and organ engineering integrate the use of automated digital manufacturing methods, such as 3D printing, bioprinting, and biofabrication. Human tissues and organs, and their intra- and interphysiological interplay, are particularly intricate. For this reason, attentiveness is rising to intersect materials science, medicine, and biology with arts and informatics. This report presents advances in computational modeling of bioink polymerization and its compatibility with bioprinting, the use of digital design and fabrication in the development of fluidic culture devices, and the employment of generative algorithms for modeling the natural and biological augmentation of in vitro tissues. As a future direction, the use of serially linked in vitro tissues as human body-mimicking systems and their application in drug pharmacokinetics and metabolism, disease modeling, and diagnostics are discussed. © 2020 The Authors.

Additive manufacturing and advanced materials, such as liquid metals and synthetic ceramic, offer new opportunities to realize thermal systems. This paper investigates the use of additive manufacturing to develop thermal structures designed around liquid metals to provide active magnetohydrodynamic cooling by obviating the need for moving parts and addressing the corrosive issue of liquid metal. Optimized components for the magnetohydrodynamic cooling prototype have been conceptualized, modeled, simulated, and fabricated to enhance flow and thermal transport efficiency, magnetic flux intensity, material compatibility, and manufacturing feasibility. Prototype systems were used to determine electrical and magnetic saturation thresholds of electrodes and electromagnets under direct current and alternating current. Additionally, the effect of electroplated Hartmann wall on flow rate and pressure drop was determined. The magnetohydrodynamic cooling prototype was shown to reach volumetric flow rates of up to 650 mm3 ∕s and generated pressure due to Lorentz forces of up to 230 Pa, resulting in heat transfer improvement relative to passive prototype of 1.054. Magnetohydrodynamic cooling was also compared with alternative liquid metal cooling techniques to prove its benefits. © 2021, AIAA International.

In present work, with gas flow guidance, the mass transfer mechanism of vapor Si and volatile impurities, and corresponding heat transfer rule in the furnace chamber are investigated by simulation and experiment. Numerical simulation shows that vapor Si is preferentially transferred to the outlet, and temperature in the outlet is lower than the solidification temperature of vapor Si when gas flow is fixed at 0° and 1.16 m s−1 (optimal conditions). Experimental results show that volatile impurities are effectively removed (P and Al both are less than 0.01 ppmw in the refined Si ingot with >99% of removal efficiency). Moreover, volatile impurities flux positively increases with increase of vapor Si flux. Gas flow significantly gathers the vapor Si in the outlet, reinforcing evaporation kinetics of molten Si and volatile impurities, which demonstrates the numerical simulation model is feasible to control the mass transfer and evaporation kinetics. Gas flow guidance may be a promising way to improve volatile impurities removal from Si. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","Evaporation; Mass and heat transfer; Numerical simulation; Si refining; Volatile impurities","Evaporation; Flow of gases; Heat transfer; Mass transfer; Numerical models; Petroleum refining; Removal; Evaporation kinetics; Furnace chamber; Mass transfer mechanism; Optimal conditions; Removal efficiencies; Simulation model; Solidification temperature; Volatile impurities; Silicon","","","","","Double-First Class” Foundation of Materials and Intelligent Manufacturing Discipline of Xiamen University; East-West Joint Project of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region; Foundation of Materials and Intelligent Manufacturing Discipline of Xiamen University","Funding text 1: The authors grateful acknowledge the financial support from project Preparation of Crystalline Silicon and Extended Technology by EDM method supported by the East-West Joint Project of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.

Objective: We developed a depth camera–based, task-specific virtual reality game, Stomp Joy, for poststroke rehabilitation of the lower extremities. This study aims to assess its feasibility and clinical efficacy. Methods: We carried out a feasibility test for Stomp Joy within representative user groups. Then, a clinical efficacy experiment was performed with a randomized controlled trial, in which 22 patients with stroke received 10 sessions (2 weeks) of conventional physical therapy only (control group) or conventional physical therapy plus 30 minutes of the Stomp Joy intervention (experimental group) in the clinic. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Lower Extremity (FMA-LE), Modified Barthel Index (MBI), Berg Balance Scale (BBS) score, single-leg stance (SLS) time, dropout rate, and adverse effects were recorded. Results: This feasibility test showed that Stomp Joy improved interest, pressure, perceived competence, value, and effort using the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory. The clinical efficacy trial showed a significant time-group interaction effect for the FMA-LE (P=.006), MBI (P=.001), BBS (P=.004), and SLS time (P=.001). A significant time effect was found for the FMA-LE (P=.001), MBI (P<.001), BBS (P<.001), and SLS time (P=.03). These indicated an improvement in lower extremity motor ability, basic activities of daily living, balance ability, and single-leg stance time in both groups after 2 weeks of the intervention. However, no significant group effects were found for the FMA-LE (P=.06), MBI (P=.76), and BBS (P=.38), while a significant group interaction was detected for SLS time (P<.001). These results indicated that the experimental group significantly improved more in SLS time than did the control group. During the study, 2 dropouts, including 1 participant who fell, were reported. Conclusions: Stomp Joy is an effective depth camera–based virtual reality game for replacing part of conventional physiotherapy, achieving equally effective improvement in lower extremity function among stroke survivors. High-powered randomized controlled studies are now needed before recommending the routine use of Stomp Joy in order to confirm these findings by recruiting a large sample size. © Yangfan Xu, Meiqinzi Tong, Wai-Kit Ming, Yangyang Lin, Wangxiang Mai, Weixin Huang, Zhuoming Chen.","Lower extremity;

Various methods have been developed based on the material dry unit weight or density. As a simple alternative method, this research investigates a new technique for the compaction control of sand using a dynamic lightweight cone penetrometer (DLP). This penetrometer has the same design as the widely used standard cone penetrometer but has a lighter hammer mass of 2.25 kg. A large number of tests were carried out in large moulds in the laboratory using two different typical sand samples from Western Australia. Strong correlations were found between the compacted dry density and the dynamic lightweight cone penetrometer index for the two experimental sand samples used in this study with different moisture contents. DLP can provide a rapid, simple and less expensive method for the compaction control of compacted sand fills in the field. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","compaction control;

The objective of this work is to compare the difference of the solidification behaviors by means of numerical simulation when it precisely deposits material upon the single- and multiple-layer. Here, a three-dimensional (3D) heat transfer and fluid flow model of arc-based additive manufacturing to calculate thermal-flow fields, deposit shape and size, cooling rates and solidification parameters was developed. The calculated fusion zone geometries for the single- and multiple-layer deposition processes considering convective flow of melts agreed well with the corresponding experimental data for AA2319 deposits. It was found that under the same process parameters, the cooling rate and the solidification rate of the molten pool for the single-layer deposition process are always greater than that for the multiplelayer deposition process. Specifically, the refined equiaxed grains are more easily obtained at a cooling rate greater than 50 K ps-1 when the polarity is designated as direct current electrode positive (DCEP). Width of the deposited bead of multi-layer structures is significantly greater than that of single-layer structures due to the lack of material at the lateral sides and the ambient conditions for the heat loss. © 2020 Japan Welding Society.

Current autologous fat graft implantations can result in up to 90% of volume loss in long-term outcomes due to their limited revascularization. Adipose tissue has a highly vascularized structure which enables its proper homeostasis as well as its endocrine function. Mature adipocytes surrounded by a dense vascular network are the specific features required for efficient regeneration of the adipose tissue to perform host anastomosis after its implantation. Recently, bioprinting has been introduced as a promising solution to recreate in vitro this architecture in large-scale tissues. However, the in vitro induction of both the angiogenesis and adipogenesis differentiations from stem cells yields limited maturation states for these two pathways. To overcome these issues, we report a novel method for obtaining a fully vascularized adipose tissue reconstruction using supporting bath bioprinting. For the first time, directly isolated mature adipocytes encapsulated in a bioink containing physiological collagen microfibers (CMF) were bioprinted in a gellan gum supporting bath. These multilayered bioprinted tissues retained high viability even after 7 days of culture. Moreover, the functionality was also confirmed by the maintenance of fatty acid uptake from mature adipocytes. Therefore, this method of constructing fully functional adipose tissue regeneration holds promise for future clinical applications.

The research presented herein is seeking to integrate AM into the construction sector through the establishment of an automated end-to-end framework for the generation of high-performance AM structures, combining sophisticated optimization techniques with cutting edge AM methods. Trusses of tubular cross-section subjected to different load cases have been selected as the demonstrators of the proposed framework. Optimization studies, featuring numerical layout and geometry optimization techniques, are employed to obtain the topology of the examined structures, accounting for practical and manufacturing constraints. Cross-section optimization is subsequently undertaken, followed by a series of geometric operations for the design of free-form joints connecting the optimized members. Solid models of the optimized designs are then exported for wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). Following determination of the optimal printing sequence, the trusses are printed and inspected. The efficiency of the optimized designs has been assessed by means of finite element modelling and compared against equivalent conventional designs. Design efficiency (reflected in the capacity-to-mass ratios) was at least doubled for all optimized trusses (when compared to their equivalent reference designs), demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework.  © 2013 IEEE.","Additive manufacturing; end-to-end framework; free-form joints; geometry optimization; layout optimization; optimized trusses","Construction industry; Efficiency; Finite element method; Geometry; Shape optimization; Structural optimization; Trusses; Additive manufacture; End to end; End-to-end framework; Free-form joint; Freeforms; Geometry optimization; Layout optimization; Optimization techniques; Optimized designs; Optimized trusse; 3D printers","","","","","","","Buchanan C., Gardner L., Metal 3D printing in construction: A review of methods, research, applications, opportunities and challenges, Eng.

The aim to incorporate 3 at.% Cu into Ti6Al4V(ELI) is selected for improved antibacterial properties while maintaining appropriate mechanical properties. Previously, topologically optimized Ti6Al4V(ELI) lattice structures were successfully designed, manufactured and studied for implant applications. The development of a new alloy produced by in-situ alloying of elemental powder mixture of Ti6Al4V(ELI) and pure Cu powders was used here for the production of identical lattice structures with improved antibacterial properties. One of the same as-designed CAD models was used for the manufacturing of these lattices compared to previous work on pure Ti6Al4V(ELI) lattices, making direct comparison of mechanical properties possible. Similar manufacturability highlights the applicability of this alloying technique to other lattice designs. Microstructural characterization was performed by optical and electron microscopies, as well as microCT. Mechanical characterization was performed by means of compression tests and hardness measurements. Results showed that in-situ alloying with copper leads to the formation of localized Cu-rich regions, refinement of martensitic phase and the formation of CuTi2 intermetallic precipitates, which increased the hardness and strength of the material. Deviations in wall thickness between the as-designed and as-manufactured lattices led to anisotropy of the mechanical properties of the lattices. Higher compressive strength values were obtained when thicker walls were oriented along the loading direction. Nevertheless, alloying with Cu had a higher impact on the compressive strength of lattice structure than the wall thickness deviations. The direct in-situ alloying of copper in Ti6Al4V(ELI) is a promising route for direct manufacturing of antibacterial implants. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cellular lattice structures; In-situ alloying; Laser powder bed fusion; Mechanical properties; Ti6Al4V(ELI)-Cu","Alloys; Lasers; Powders; Titanium; Alloying; Binary alloys; Compression testing; Compressive strength; Computer aided design; Computerized tomography; Copper alloys; Copper metallography; Hardness; Manufacture; Titanium alloys; Titanium metallography; aluminum; copper; titanium; vanadium; alloy; titanium alloy (TiAl6V4); Antibacterial properties; Cellular lattice structures; Direct manufacturing; Elemental powder mixture; Intermetallic precipitates; Mechanical characterizations; Micro-structural characterization; Optical and electron microscopies; anisotropy; antibacterial activity; Article; chemical structure; compressive strength; electron microscopy; mechanics; optics; powder bed fusion; priority journal; thickness; laser; powder; Structural properties","","aluminum, 7429-90-5; copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; titanium, 7440-32-6; vanadium, 7440-62-2; Alloys, ; Powders, ; Titanium, ; titanium alloy (TiAl6V4), ","","","Karlstads universitet, KAU; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी; Horizon 2020; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (823717); National Research Foundation, NRF, (97994); Tillväxtverket, (20201144)","Funding text 1: This work supported by the South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology and National Research Foundation of South Africa (Grant ? 97994).

Nowadays, because of the exceptional properties of SMPs and their implementation in 4D printing, they are most taken into attention. In this study, thermomechanical coupling effect on 3D fracture analysis of SMPs in large deformation regime has been investigated. Firstly, a thermo-visco-hyperelastic model is implemented to model the thermomechanical cycle of the SMP in the stress-free strain-recovery as well as the fixed-strain-stress-recovery processes. Motivated by fracture analysis and self-healing properties of SMPs, both 2D and 3D fracture analysis are conducted through various feasibility applications, such as flow control valve, pressure control valve, filtration and drug delivery capsule. Moreover, the ability of the analysis is shown through examining different parameters could affect the SMP response, such strain rate (or applied strain), temperature rate and memory recovery. Finally, the results show the ability of the numerical modeling in the aforesaid applications to design, analyze, and fabricate these applications. © 2020","2D & 3D self-healing SMP; 4D printing; Drug delivery soft capsule; Finite strain; Fracture analysis; Shape memory polymer (SMP)","Controlled drug delivery; Fracture; Fracture mechanics; Polymers; Recovery; Safety valves; Self-healing materials; Shape-memory polymer; Targeted drug delivery; Deformation regimes; Flow control valves; Pressure control valves; Self-healing properties; Stress-free strains; Thermomechanical coupling effects; Thermomechanical cycles; Visco-hyperelastic; Strain rate","","","","","","","Ardakani S.H., Moslemzadeh H., Mohammadi S., Delamination Analysis in Bimaterials Consisting of Shape Memory Alloy and Elastoplastic Layers, (2019); Arrieta S., Diani J., Gilormini P., Experimental characterization and thermoviscoelastic modeling of strain and stress recoveries of an amorphous polymer network, Mech.

The brute force optimization needs too many experiments and/or analyses to obtain an optimized design. However, the same engineering design can be achieved by fewer experiments by using design of experiment (DOE) methodology, which minimizes the work load. In this study, local and mean heat transfer coefficients for a grooved pipe model are optimized and the system constraints are determined in compatible with the additive manufacturing method. DOE based response surface methodology (RSM) and an in-house developed optimization code are used to obtain the optimal local and mean heat transfer coefficients. The analyses are performed for both laminar and turbulent flow cases for understanding the backward and forward effects of grove dimensions better. The comparison of the recirculation regions in the groove geometries for optimal cases of laminar and turbulent flows reveals that the grooves in the pipe do not have to be uniform along the streamwise direction to obtain optimal heat transfer for local needs. This optimization approach provides both local and global controllability of heat transfer and the heat transfer values can be increased up to 20% in this thermal-fluid engineering problem. In addition, pressure drop and heat transfer contribution ratio of each grooved section are presented in detail. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","Additive manufacturing; Design of experiments; Heat transfer optimization; Response surface methodology; Stochastic algorithms.","3D printers; Additives; Design of experiments; Heat transfer coefficients; Heating; Optimal systems; Stochastic systems; Thermal Engineering; Turbulent flow; Global controllability; Laminar and turbulent flow; Optimization approach; Recirculation regions; Response surface methodology; Stochastic algorithms; Streamwise directions; Thermal fluid engineering; Stochastic models","","","","","Izmir Kâtip Çelebi University, (2017-ÖNAP-MÜMF-0005)","This study was supported by the Scientific Research Project Coordinatorship of Izmir Kâtip Çelebi University ( 2017-ÖNAP-MÜMF-0005 ).

The problem is relevant for fire safety and the associated understanding of the generation mechanism of the newly discovered whirling flame, the so-called blue whirl. Based on the dynamic balance of the triple flame propagation speed and the local flow velocity at the bottom boundary layer, theoretical solutions of the liftoff position, rf, and the critical blowout limit represented by its Ekman number, EkBt, are derived. The theoretical results agree well with the numerical results both qualitatively and quantitatively. It is shown that the response of rf to the system Damköhler number, Da, forms a typical C-shaped curve and there are two solutions of rf for relatively large Da, with the one closer to the edge of the fuel pool being stable while the other being unstable. Explicit solution of the blowout limit shows that EkBt(SLS)4/3, where SLS is the stoichiometric planar flame speed. This is because not only the triple flame propagation speed linearly increases as SLS increases, but the flame front can also reach a position closer to the edge of the fuel pool where the flow velocity is lower. The effect of the transversal radial velocity gradient (TVG) at the Ekman boundary layer on the stabilization of the fire whirl is also investigated. The TVG makes the flame harder to liftoff and blowout and the effect of which can be described by a non-dimensional parameter, λ, which represents the ratio of the flame curvature and the TVG. The TVG normally plays a secondary role in the triple flame propagation due to the relatively large flame curvature of the triple flame. © 2020 The Combustion Institute.","Blowout; Fire whirl; Liftoff; Stabilization; Triple flame","Blowouts; Boundary layers; Fires; Flame research; Flow velocity; Blowout; Ekman boundary layers; Fire whirl; Flame curvatures; Flame propagation speed; Fuel pools; Liftoff; Radial velocity; Triple flame; Velocity gradients; Stabilization","","","","","","","Wang P., Liu N., Hartl K., Smits A., Fire Technol., 52, 1, pp. 263-272, (2016); Tohidi A., Gollner M.J., Xiao H., Annu.

Here, an anatomically correct IVD scaffold composed of biomaterials, cells, and growth factors were fabricated via three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technology. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and transforming growth factor-β3 (TGF-β3) were loaded onto polydopamine nanoparticles, which were mixed with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) for regenerating and simulating the structure and function of the nucleus pulposus and annular fibrosus. In vitro experiments confirmed that CTGF and TGF-β3 could be released from the IVD scaffold in a spatially controlled manner, and induced the corresponding BMSCs to differentiate into nucleus pulposus like cells and annulus fibrosus like cells. Next, the fabricated IVD scaffold was implanted into the dorsum subcutaneous of nude mice. The reconstructed IVD exhibited a zone-specific matrix that displayed the corresponding histological and immunological phenotypes: primarily type II collagen and glycosaminoglycan in the core zone, and type I collagen in the surrounding zone. The testing results demonstrated that it exhibited good biomechanical function of the reconstructed IVD. The results presented herein reveal the clinical application potential of the dual growth factors-releasing IVD scaffold fabricated via 3D bioprinting. However, the evaluation in large mammal animal models needs to be further studied. © 2020 [The Author/The Authors]","3D bioprinting; Growth factor (GF); Intervertebral disc (IVD); Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs); Regenerative medicine","collagen type 1; collagen type 2; connective tissue growth factor; glycosaminoglycan; molecular scaffold; nanoparticle; polydopamine nanoparticle; transforming growth factor beta3; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; annulus fibrosus; Article; biomechanics; cell differentiation; cell viability; controlled study; drug release; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; immunohistochemistry; intervertebral disk degeneration; mesenchymal stem cell; mouse; nonhuman; nucleus pulposus; particle size; phenotype; Raman spectrometry; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; scanning electron microscopy; stereomicroscopy; surface property; three dimensional bioprinting","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81802131); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2019T120347, XK2019013); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFA0703000, 2018YFB1105600); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This research was supported by National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2018YFB1105600 ,No. 2018YFA0703000 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81802131 ), Project funded by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2019T120347 ) and the fund of No. XK2019013 .

Additive manufacturing falls into this category by nature of its repetitive action in building three-dimensional structures in a layer-by-layer manner. In literature, spatial ILC (SILC) has been used in conjunction with additive processes to regulate single-layer structures with only one class of material. However, SILC has the unexplored potential to regulate additive manufacturing structures with multiple build materials in a three-dimensional fashion. Estimating the appropriate feedforward signal in these structures can be challenging due to iteration varying initial conditions, system parameters, and surface interaction dynamics in different layers of multi-material structures. In this paper, SILC is used as a recursive control strategy to iteratively construct the feedforward signal to improve part quality of 3D structures that consist of at least two materials in a layer-by-layer manner. The system dynamics are approximated by discrete 2D spatial convolution using kernels that incorporate in-layer and layer-to-layer variations. We leverage the existing SILC models in literature and extend them to account for the iteration varying uncertainties in the plant model to capture a more reliable representation of the multi-material additive process. The feasibility of the proposed diagonal framework was demonstrated using simulation results of an electrohydrodynamic jet printing (e-jet) printing process. © 2021 ASME Letters in Dynamic Systems and Control.

We introduce a three-dimensional bioprinting concept that uses organoid-forming stem cells as building blocks that can be deposited directly into extracellular matrices conducive to spontaneous self-organization. By controlling the geometry and cellular density, we generated centimetre-scale tissues that comprise self-organized features such as lumens, branched vasculature and tubular intestinal epithelia with in vivo-like crypts and villus domains. Supporting cells were deposited to modulate morphogenesis in space and time, and different epithelial cells were printed sequentially to mimic the organ boundaries present in the gastrointestinal tract. We thus show how biofabrication and organoid technology can be merged to control tissue self-organization from millimetre to centimetre scales, opening new avenues for drug discovery, diagnostics and regenerative medicine. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","Bioprinting; Extracellular Matrix; Gastrointestinal Tract; Organoids; Computer architecture; Controlled drug delivery; Cytology; Diagnosis; Histology; Stem cells; Cellular density; Epithelial cells; Extracellular matrices; Gastrointestinal tract; Micro architectures; Self organizations; Three dimensions; Three-dimensional bioprinting; bioprinting; cytology; extracellular matrix; gastrointestinal tract; metabolism; organoid; procedures; Tissue","","","","","École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, EPFL; nccr – on the move; Horizon 2020; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (668294); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Wellcome Trust, WT, (211944/Z/18/Z, 211944); Wellcome Trust, WT; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (310030_179447); Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF","We thank N.

Generally, performance characteristics like cycle time, turnaround time, handling time, productivity, etc. are baselined. Many of the aforementioned metrics may not be normally distributed. In this paper, the authors discuss the cases of baselining non-normal performance characteristics. The methodology is to fit a general system of distributions namely the Pearson family of distribution and identify the SLA value using the best fit Pearson type of distribution. The methodology is demonstrated through two case studies and results are found to be very encouraging. The methodology can be used for baselining of non-normal performance characteristics of various service industries.

Developing continuous printing trajectories to improve the mechanical properties of the as-built parts is of great significance. However, myriad jumping paths and gathered connection paths occur in the existing printing strategies causing inferior part quality. In this study, we present a novel continuous printing strategy to avoid jumping paths and achieve the unique dispersion of connection paths. Tensile and three-point bending tests are conducted to verify the enhanced mechanical performance. This work enables us to eliminate the cutting mechanism in the commercial C-CFRP printers. © 2020 Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME)","Additive manufacturing; Continuous carbon fiber reinforced plastic composites; Continuous printing strategy; Mechanical property","3D printers; Additives; Bending dies; Bending tests; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Graphite fibers; Carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composites; Cutting mechanisms; Mechanical performance; Part quality; Three-point bending test; Plastics industry","","","","","Dalian Science and Technology Innovation Fund, (2018J11CY001); Liaoning Revitalization Talents Program, (XLYC1801008, XLYC1902014, XLYCYSZX1901)","Fuji Wang acknowledges the supports by the Science and Technology Innovation Foundation of Dalian (2018J11CY001) and Liaoning Revitalization Program (XLYC1902014, XLYC1801008, and XLYCYSZX1901).","Williams G., Trask R., Bond I., A self-healing carbon fibre reinforced polymer for aerospace applications, Compos A Appl Sci Manuf, 38, 6, pp. 1525-1532, (2007); Friedrich K., Almajid A.A., Manufacturing Aspects of Advanced Polymer Composites for Automotive Applications, Appl Compos Mater, 20, 2, pp. 107-128, (2013); Ku H., Wang H., Pattarachaiyakoop N., Trada M., A review on the tensile properties of natural fiber reinforced polymer composites, Compos B Eng, 42, 4, pp. 856-873, (2011); Goh G.D., Yap Y.L., Agarwala S., Yeong W.Y., Recent Progress in Additive Manufacturing of Fiber Reinforced Polymer Composite, Adv.

The development of the prosthetic device includes designing the mechanical and electronic parts, programming the Arduino board and Android application for control, simulation and analysis of 3D printed parts most subjected to stress, and 3D printing the parts under different settings. The device was tested in terms of time spent and capacity of lifting varying loads when not worn and when worn by users.

However, the ability to unravel how these cues dictate the biological function in bioprinted constructs is limited by the lack of extracellular matrix (ECM)-mimetic bioinks with fully controllable properties. In this study, a multifunctional bioink that uniquely combines the independent control over the biochemical and biophysical cues that regulate cell fate with the bioorthogonal nature of thiol–norbornene photoclick chemistry is designed for the extrusion bioprinting of bioinspired 3D cellular niches with tunable properties. The bioink rheology is controlled by ionic gelation, being dependent on both the type and content of divalent ions (calcium and barium), while the mechanical and biochemical properties of hydrogels are tailored via a post printing thiol–ene reaction. Bioprinted cell-adhesive and protease-degradable hydrogels modulate cell proliferation and ECM deposition in a matrix-stiffness dependent manner over 14 days of culture regardless of cell spreading, demonstrating the ability to probe the effect of matrix cues on cell response. This bioink can be used as a versatile platform where building blocks can be rationally combined for the bioprinting of functional cell- and tissue-specific constructs with controlled cellular behavior. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","biofabrication; bioinks; click chemistry; extracellular matrix; hydrogels","Bioprinting; Cues; Hydrogels; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; Adhesives; Cell proliferation; Cytology; Gelation; Hydrogels; Stiffness matrix; alkene derivative; barium ion; calcium ion; hydrogel; norbornene; thiol; unclassified drug; Biochemical properties; Biological functions; Cellular behaviors; Degradable hydrogel; Extracellular matrices; Functional cells; Independent control; Tunable properties; Article; bioengineering; bioink; cell culture; cell fate; cell proliferation; cell spreading; cellular parameters; chemical reaction; click chemistry; extracellular matrix; flow kinetics; gelation; ionic gelation; photoclick chemistry; priority journal; three dimensional bioprinting; three dimensional cellular niche; association; bioprinting; hydrogel; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; Cells","","barium ion, 22541-12-4; calcium ion, 14127-61-8; Hydrogels, ","","","Centro de Materiais da Universidade do Porto; Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional funds COMPETE; Institute for Research and Innovation in Health Sciences, (PTDC/BBB‐ECT/2145/2014, PTDC/MEC‐GIN/29232/2017, UID/BIM/04293/2020); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (Norte-01-0145-FEDER-000012); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the FEDER – Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional funds COMPETE 2020 – Operacional Programme for Competitiveness and Internationalisation (POCI), Portugal 2020, and by Portuguese funds through the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) in the framework of the projects Norte-01-0145-FEDER-000012, “Institute for Research and Innovation in Health Sciences” (UID/BIM/04293/2020), 0245_IBEROS_1_E, PTDC/BBB-ECT/2145/2014, and PTDC/MEC-GIN/29232/2017.

One of these promising opportunities is to use the underused assets in people-based systems to transport goods. In this paper, we consider an integrated system in which a set of freight requests needs to be delivered using a fleet of grounded, and autonomous, pickup and delivery (PD) robots where a public transportation service (referred to as scheduled line (SL)) can be used as part of PD robot's journey. Passengers and PD robots (carrying freight) share the available capacity on SLs where passengers are prioritised, and their transport demand is stochastic. Thus the number of available places for PD robots is only revealed upon shuttle arrival to the corresponding SL station. We first formulate this problem as a Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows and Scheduled Lines (PDPTW-SL). We then introduce a sample average approximation (SAA) method along with an Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search (ALNS) algorithm for solving the stochastic optimization problem. Finally, we present an extensive computational study, analyse its results and give some directions for future research. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ALNS; pickup and delivery;

The device was fabricated from a photopolymer material using a three-dimensional printing technique and tested for flow resistance and cooling performance using water as the working fluid. Parallel to physical experiments, computational simulations were performed using a quarter-jet repeating unit cell consistent with the physical device geometry, but independent of the manifold architecture. Pressure drop and heat transfer results from both methods were evaluated and compared. It was found that the computational and experimental pressure drop results showed excellent agreement after manifold pressure drops were properly accounted for using a reduced-order analytical model. Heat transfer results were shown to have reasonable agreement with differing trends. A discussion on possible causes for the difference is presented and suggestions are made for future accommodation.

This leads to the problems of high energy consumption, high number of migrations, and high average service-level agreement (SLA) violation rate. In order to solve the above problems, an adaptive deployment algorithm for IaaS cloud virtual machines based on Q learning mechanism is proposed in this research. Based on the deployment principle, the deployment characteristics of the IaaS cloud virtual machines are analyzed. The virtual machine scheduling problem is replaced with the Markov process. The multistep Q learning algorithm is used to schedule the virtual machines based on the Q learning mechanism to complete the adaptive deployment of the IaaS cloud virtual machines. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has low energy consumption, small number of migrations, and low average SLA violation rate. © 2021 Shuguang Chen.","","Energy utilization; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS); Learning algorithms; Markov processes; Reinforcement learning; Virtual machine; Deployment algorithms; Deployment characteristics; Deployment process; High energy consumption; Iaas clouds; Learning mechanism; Q-learning; Servicelevel agreement (SLA); Violation rates; Virtual machine scheduling; Network security","","","","","","","Qiao S., Zhang Q., Zhang Q., Hybrid seismic-electrical data acquisition station based on cloud technology and green IoT, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 31026-31033, (2020); Bouza M.K., Cloud technology is the foundation for designing efficient application, Artificial Intelligence, 24, 1-2, pp. 14-23, (2019); Mohammadhosseini M., Haghighat A.T., Mahdipour E., An efficient energy-aware method for virtual machine placement in cloud data centers using the cultural algorithm, The Journal of Supercomputing, 75, 10, pp. 6904-6933, (2019); Lei Z., Wang L., Virtual machine deployment and migration optimization mechanism for cloud data center, Computer Engineering and Design, 40, 8, pp. 2216-2223, (2019); Liao J., Qingxiao S., Yang H., Research on preemptible virtual machine instance configuration and scheduling methods that meet the execution time limit of workflow, Computer Engineering and Science, 42, 11, pp. 1956-1964, (2020); Jiliang L., Bing Q., Wenjiang L., A cloud virtual machine scheduling strategy combining wake-up threshold and semi-sleep mode, Journal of Yanshan University, 44, 4, pp. 370-378, (2020); Ghasemi A., Haghighat A.T., A multi-objective load balancing algorithm for virtual machine placement in cloud data centers based on machine learning, Computing, 102, 9, pp. 2049-2072, (2020); Sayadnavard M.H., Haghighat A.T., Rahmani A.M., A reliable energy-aware approach for dynamic virtual machine consolidation in cloud data centers, Journal of Supercomputing, 75, 4, pp. 2126-2147, (2019); Jin S., Qie X., Zhao W., Yue W., Takahashi Y., A clustered virtual machine allocation strategy based on a sleep-mode with wake-up threshold in a cloud environment, Annals of Operations Research, 293, 1, pp. 193-212, (2020); Xu H., Cheng P., Liu Y., A fault tolerance aware virtual machine scheduling algorithm in cloud computing, International Journal of Performability Engineering, 15, 11, (2019); Usman M.J., Ismail A.S., Chizari H., Abdul-Salaam G., Usman A.M., Gital A.Y., Kaiwartya O., Aliyu A., Energy-efficient virtual machine allocation technique using flower pollination algorithm in cloud datacenter: A panacea to green computing, Journal of Bionic Engineering, 16, 2, pp. 354-366, (2019); Xi X., Cao X., Yang P., Network resource allocation for eMBB payload and URLLC control information communication multiplexing in a multi-UAV relay network, IEEE Transactions on Communications, 69, 3, pp. 1802-1817, (2021); Li Z., Ding Z., Distributed multiobjective optimization for network resource allocation of multiagent systems, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, (2020); Coorevits T., Kossman S., Chicot D., Hennebelle F., Montagne A., Iost A., Virtual machine concept applied to uncertainties estimation in instrumented indentation testing, Journal of Materials Research, 34, 14, pp. 2501-2516, (2019); Liang Z., Liu Y., Lok T.-M., Huang K., Multi-cell mobile edge computing: Joint service migration and resource allocation, IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 20, 9, (2021); Qian H., Yu J., Hua L., Relay selection algorithm based on social network combined with Q -learning for vehicle D2D communication, IET Communications, 13, 20, pp. 3582-3587, (2019); Fan Y., He M., Su L., Zhou -.

It is to be noted that the foam production parameters have significant influence on the cellular structure of foam concrete, which governs the material properties of concrete. Hence, in an attempt to improve the foam quality, the present work focuses on evaluation of the suitability of viscosity enhancing agent carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) in performance improvement of foam produced with surfactant sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) for use in foam concrete production. Firstly, the influence of the addition of CMC on behavior of foam produced with surfactant SLS was studied by evaluating essential characteristics such as foam density, foam stability, and viscosity of surfactant solution. As a next step, the microstructure of foam and its behavior in cement slurry and mortar at the optimized concentrations of SLS and CMC were studied. Experimental studies revealed that the addition of 0.2 % CMC to 2.5 % SLS surfactant solution resulted in a 134 % increase in viscosity of surfactant solution, which eventually resulted in tremendous improvement in foam quality in terms of 34 % reduction in foam drainage (at the 5th minute after foam generation) and 22 % reduction in larger size foam bubbles (D90). Furthermore, as the air void microstructure of foam concrete is dependent on the foam bubble sizes, the reduction in foam bubble sizes resulted in 20 % enhancement in compressive strength of foam concrete. The addition of CMC is also found to affect the workability of foam concrete mixes, which is evident from the reduction in flow spread and the increase in flow time. Also, as the foam has retarding properties, the increase in foam content is found to increase the demolding time requirement of foam concrete specimens.

However, the existing printing mechanism is normally based on slices of a 3D structure in computer-aided slicer software and prints in horizontal and diagonal manners. Such printing mechanism involving soft bioink which does not polymerise in short period of time produces distorted constructs due to the thixotropic properties of the bioink. To circumvent this problem, G-codes for simple 3D bioprinting mechanism were derived. A 3D bioprinter has been developed to implement unidirectional printing for different concentration of bioink. The modified coding was successfully customized for printing single layer to multilayer hexagonal structures. Additionally, the dimension accuracy of the 3D printing in producing similar dimensions of a design in CAD software is highly dependent on the concentration of the bioink applied. The results show that up to 97 % of printing accuracy can be achieved by applying 10: 50 % v/v of alginate/gelatin bioink. © 2021 UTHM Publisher.

One of the considered states is the Serviceability Limit State (SLS), which verifies that the permanent rotation of the foundation generated from accumulated strains in the soil is below a project specific criterion. Despite design codes requiring an estimation of the permanent rotation, there is not clear guidance on how to implement this. This paper describes a methodology to estimate the monopile permanent rotation for SLS and discusses its advantages and limitations. The methodology combines an accumulation method with results from 3D Finite Element Analyses (FEA) and a soil model that accounts for strain accumulation as a function of the number of cycles, relative density and load characteristics. The performance of the proposed methodology is compared against experimental centrifuge tests and results from advanced 3D FEA, indicating that it can predict the permanent rotation with satisfactory accuracy, and with a considerable reduction in computational effort. This is important for the design of OWTs, where different load histories might be required to be checked – often under tight time constraints – to find which load history leads to the largest permanent rotation, and therefore is more critical to SLS design. © 2020 The Authors","Accumulated rotation; Design; High cycle accumulation; Numerical modelling; Offshore wind turbine foundations; Serviceability limit state","Offshore oil well production; Rotation; Strain; Accumulated strain; Centrifuge tests; Computational effort; Load characteristics; Number of cycles; Relative density; Serviceability limit state; Strain accumulations; accumulation; centrifugal model test; finite element method; limit analysis; offshore structure; pile; prediction; rotation; sand; soil-structure interaction; wind turbine; Offshore wind turbines","","","","","WAS-XL, (268182); EDF Energy; University of Sheffield; Norges Forskningsråd; ÃlectricitÃ© de France, EDF","Funding text 1: The authors wish to gratefully acknowledge the financial support by the Research Council of Norway and the industrial partners Equinor, Innogy, EDF, and Multiconsult through the project Wave loads And Soil support for eXtra Large monopiles ( WAS-XL ), Grant No. 268182 , and the financial support received through a NGI internal strategic research project SP9: Behaviour of Sand under Partial Drainage and Offshore Foundation which is funded by the Research Council of Norway through an annual base funding to NGI .

A number of MEMS studies in literature have addressed 3D actuation either through a single scanning unit with three degrees of freedom, or combination of multiple scanning units each having one or more degrees of freedom in scanning. Such microsystems are manufactured with high fabrication complexity while only offering a limited (typically < 0.5 mm) actuation capability in the axial dimension whereas advances in the adaptive optics and wave-front shaping allow for light penetration up to several millimeters within the tissue. In an effort to address deep tissue slices that light can penetrate using adaptive optics, here we present a 3D printed Polyamide-based 3D actuator with hybrid hydraulic and electromagnetic actuation mechanisms. Our actuator is able to provide up to 3 mm axial displacement in air (and 4 mm in tissue), with only a pumped fluid pressure of 500 kPa. Furthermore, the actuator provides 5 degrees total optical scan angle in the lateral directions, with 5 Vrms drive voltage that is applied to the coil. Overall, the device is manufactured in a compact form factor, having 10 mm diameter and 45 mm length, making it suitable for endoscopic or within hand-held probe use. Using selective laser sintering process in manufacturing the actuator allows for low-cost and rapid manufacturing capability making the device attractive for use in disposable laser scanning probes for imaging within the gastrointestinal tract. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","3D-printing; Actuators; Confocal microscopy; Electromagnetic actuation; Hydraulic actuation; Selective laser sintering; SLS","Adaptive optics; Air; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Laser heating; Light; MEMS; Scanning; Selective laser sintering; Sintering; Tissue; Wavefronts; Actuation capability; Axial displacements; Electromagnetic actuation; Gastrointestinal tract; Lateral directions; Rapid manufacturing; Three degrees of freedom; Wave front shaping; Hydraulic actuators","","","","","S cientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey; TUBITAK, (117E235); Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştirma Kurumu, TÜBITAK","Funding text 1: This document is the results of the research project funded by the S cientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) grant no: 117E235. ; Funding text 2: This document is the results of the research project funded by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) grant no:117E235.","Diaspro A., Confocal and Two-Photon Microscopy: Foundations, Applications and Advances, (2002); Seibel E.J., Smithwick Q.Y.J., Unique features of optical scanning, single fiber endoscopy, Lasers Surg.

Box: 14115-143, Tehran, Iran","Abstract: Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) has several industrial applications because of its advantages over other additive manufacturing methods. In this study, two stainless steel 347 walls, namely as-deposited (AD) wall, and inter-layer cold worked (CW) wall, were prepared using the WAAM method to investigate the isotropy of their mechanical properties and wear properties in vertical and horizontal directions. For the AD wall, the mean yield strength, ultimate strength, and elongation of horizontal samples were 410 MPa, 620 MPa, and 47%, respectively. In comparison, these values for the vertical (V) samples were 402 MPa, 590 MPa, and 49%, respectively. For the CW wall, the mean yield strength, ultimate strength, and elongation of horizontal samples were 815 MPa, 876 MPa, and 26%, respectively, while those of vertical samples were 722 MPa, 824 MPa, and 25%, respectively. The CW wall’s tensile test results indicated that inter-layer cold working intensified the anisotropy of tensile properties in both vertical and horizontal directions. Microstructural investigation revealed that inter-layer cold working and the heat resulted from subsequent layers deposition in the CW wall recrystallized the layers and reduced the grain size. Additionally, wear test results demonstrated that inter-layer cold working increased hardness and thus wear-resistance of the samples and reduced their friction. The results showed that the coefficient of friction (COF) and wear rates of the samples are not highly dependent on their direction.

The lure of additive manufacturing lies in the quick time-to-market and ability to produce parts and components with high degrees of topographical complexity empowered by the layer-by-layer production approach. One challenge that is attracting a significant amount of attention is improving the multi-functionality of additively manufactured parts, as enabling multi-functionality will result in transitioning AM to a broader application domain. The objective of this paper is to report novel developments that improve the functionality of polymer-based parts by adding electrical conductivity and fluid management to the existing load-bearing capabilities. A space structure was 3D-printed using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) with embedded internal channels throughout the entire structure and then sealed using an acetone-diluted epoxy. The inner surfaces of the embedded channels of the sealed structure were then metallized using an electroless silver-coating process; these processes were found to be robust and independent of the inner diameter and length of the structure. The electromechanical performance of the structure was verified by applying mechanical loading while monitoring the change in electrical resistivity. The latter was found to remain nearly constant up to the point of ultimate mechanical failure. Finite element modeling was used to identify the areas of structural weaknesses and assist in elucidating the failure modes. The results were found to be in good agreement with the experimental data. © 2020 Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc..

In general, a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) system is required not only to generate the deposition path as a numerical control data but also to estimate the shape of the build structure. Estimating the build structure before the actual fabrication can help determine the optimal process parameters. However, the build structure simulated using the existing CAM system may not be sufficiently accurate, because the bead geometry is influenced by various factors, such as the process parameters, material type, target shape, and the location in which the molten metal is deposited. In this scenario, it is challenging to obtain the optimal process parameters based on the build structure simulation results. Therefore, in this study, a two-dimensional bead cross-section model was established, in which the bead accumulation was considered to fabricate a shell structure, and a build shell structure simulator was developed. The temperature distribution was numerically simulated to obtain the relationship between a process parameter and the bead cross-section geometry without conducting destructive inspection. Furthermore, the accuracy of the simulator was investigated. The results indicated that the accuracy of the simulator was approximately ±1 mm in the area with a low influence of the deposition start and stop processes. © 2021 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers","Additive manufacturing; Arc discharge; CAM; Directed energy deposition; Welding; Wire material","Additives; Computer aided manufacturing; Computer control systems; Deposition; Electric welding; Liquid metals; Simulators; Additive manufacturing process; Cross section model; Cross-section geometry; Destructive inspection; Numerical control; Process parameters; Prototype machine; Structure simulations; 3D printers","","","","","MAZAK foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (JP16K17995)","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP16K17995 and MAZAK foundation.","Abe T., Katagiri M., Sasahara H., Accurate fabrication by improvement of lamination path on direct metal lamination using arc discharge, Proceedings - ASPE 2012 Annual Meeting, 54, 54, pp. 269-299, (2012); Abe T., Sasahara H., Development of the shell structures fabrication CAM system for direct metal lamination using arc discharge-lamination height error compensation by torch feed speed control, International Journal of Precision Engineering and Manufacturing, 16, 1, pp. 171-176, (2015); Christensen N., Davies V., Jermundsen K.

Most current SCs are generally limited by their low stretchability, complicated fabrication process, and insufficient performance and robustness. This study presents a facile method to fabricate arbitrary-shaped stretchable electrodes via 4D printing of conductive composite from reduced graphene oxide, carbon nanotube, and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate. The electrode patterns of an arbitrary shape can be deposited onto prestretched substrates by aerosol-jet printing, then self-organized origami (ridge) patterns are generated after releasing the substrates from holding stretchers due to the mismatched strains. The stretchable electrodes demonstrate superior mechanical robustness and stretchability without sacrificing its outstanding electrochemical performance. The symmetric SC prototype possesses a gravimetric capacitance of ≈21.7 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and a capacitance retention of ≈85.8% from 0.5 to 5 A g−1. A SC array with arbitrary-shaped electrodes is also fabricated and connected in series to power light-emitting diode patterns for large-scale applications. The proposed method paves avenues for scalable manufacturing of future energy-storage devices with controlled extensibility and high electrochemical performance. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","4D printing; aerosol-jet printing; hybrid composites; self-organized origami; stretchable supercapacitors","Capacitance; Carbon nanotubes; Energy storage; Graphene; Hybrid materials; Substrates; Supercapacitor; Capacitance retention; Electrochemical performance; Gravimetric capacitance; Hybrid composite materials; Large-scale applications; Poly-3 ,4-ethylenedioxythiophene; Stretchable electrodes; Stretchable electronics; Electrochemical electrodes","","","","","USDA-NIFA; USDA‐NIFA; National Science Foundation, NSF, (ECCS‐1344745, ECCS‐2024649); National Science Foundation, NSF; Michigan State University, MSU","Funding text 1: This work is partially supported by NSF (ECCS-2024649), NSF (ECCS-1344745), USDA-NIFA (Hatch Project-1016788), and Michigan State University.

Seamlessly communicating among people, including vulnerable groups, is an important sign of social civilization and technological progress. As an important sensor, micro-Doppler (MD) radar has many advantages such as not being restricted by ambient light, long detection distance, no need to consider occlusion, and sensitive detection to slight movements. In recent years, it has been used in various recognition tasks. In this article, we proposed a sign language (SL)/hand gesture recognition method based on a novel discriminative feature, built a measurement system of hand movements using an ultrawideband (UWB) radar, measured ten-type, 15-type SL actions, and ten-type hand gesture actions, and completed the tasks of ten-type SL/hand gesture recognition based on the extracted new features. Compared with the five related methods, experimental results show that the proposed method improves the recognition accuracy by 6.4% on the ten-type SL dataset, which proves the effectiveness of the new cumulative distribution density (CDD) features. For comparison, the proposed method is directly applied to the ten-type hand gesture dataset without any change, and recognition accuracy is improved by 8.6%, which verifies the universality of the proposed new CDD features. Meanwhile, we also give the experimental results when the radial distance measured by radar changes and the types of SL increase. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Classification; cumulative distribution density (CDD); hand gestures; micro-Doppler (MD); recognition; sign language (SL)","Palmprint recognition; Radar; Radar measurement; Ultra-wideband (UWB); Cumulative distribution; Discriminative features; Measurement system; Recognition accuracy; Sensitive detection; Technological progress; Ultra wideband radars; Vulnerable groups; Gesture recognition","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61520106002); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","Manuscript received May 22, 2021; accepted June 15, 2021.

However, 3D printing using a metal compound has disadvantages in that it increases the cost for supplying metal materials. A method of using slag which is a recyclable material has been proposed to reduce costs. With the growing demand for additive manufacturing using by-products, slag has gained attention as a diverse recycling material for 3D printing technologies. A new fabrication approach was analyzed for producing porous bodies via additive manufacturing for blending slag and reinforced metals. However, because of its low quality due to low strength, low durability, and structural defeats, the amount of slag generated is high, and its usability remains uncertain. Also, slag is an excellent material with a huge potential for producing structures with high mechanical properties, and limited research in the area of slag recycling has been conducted due to difficulties in sintering the iron by-products. To develop a recycling approach that utilizes slag in 3D printing powders, a study to increase the industrial usability by mixing slag and ceramic beads was described. A method was presented to compare the physical properties of 3D printed slag parts with the physical properties of those generated by blending iron slag, alumina, and zirconia. In order to find the mixing ratio with the optimum physical properties, the average particle size, bending stress, and maximum compressive stress were tested. The combination ratio to obtain the highest strength was when iron slag powder was 40% and alumina was 60%. In addition, the specimens by composition to which the stress test was applied were cut to analyze the tissue under a microscope. It is thought that cracking in the sintered structure decreases and density increases by mixing alumina and zirconium, contributing to increased strength. When a ceramic bead composed of alumina and zirconium is mixed with slag to form a composite material, a metal compound having a level of physical properties that can be used as a material for 3D printing can be produced. Furthermore, a novel concept of producing lightweight structural materials via additive manufacturing, which entails a fabrication process whereby high-strength metals are stacked inside hollow base steels, was proposed. © 2020, China Iron and Steel Research Institute Group.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; By-product; Mechanical property; Slag","Additives; Aluminum oxide; Blending; Compressive stress; Iron; Iron research; Layered manufacturing; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Powder metals; Recycling; Sintered alumina; Sintering; Slags; Structural metals; Structural properties; Zirconia; Zirconium; Average particle size; Fabrication process; High mechanical properties; Lightweight structural materials; Metal materials; Recyclable material; Recycling materials; Three-dimensional (3D) printing; 3D printers","","","","","","","Xi B., Li R., Zhao X., Dang Q., Zhang D., Tan W., Resour.

Despite the wealth of technological progress at the time of the crisis caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus: Virus that causes current Pandemic situation (COVID-19), the global population had long been exposed beforehand to an acute absence of essential medical devices. As a response, a new type of composite materials intended for rapid prototyping, based on layered silicate saponite (Sap), antimicrobial dye phloxine B (PhB) and thermoplastics, has been recently developed. Design/methodology/approach: Sap was modified with a cationic surfactant and subsequently functionalized with PhB. The hybrid material in powder form was then grounded with polyethylene terephthalate-glycol (PETG) or polylactic acid (PLA) in a precisely defined weight ratio and extruded into printing filaments. The stability and level of cytotoxicity of these materials in various physiological environments simulating the human body have been studied. The applicability of these materials in bacteria and a yeast-infected environment was evaluated. Findings: Ideal content of the hybrid material, with respect to thermoplastic, was 15 weight %. Optimal printing temperature and speed, with respect to maintaining antimicrobial activity of the prepared materials, were T = 215°C at 50 mm/s for PETG/SapPhB and T = 230°C at 40 mm/s for PLA/SapPhB. 3 D-printed air filters made of these materials could keep inner air flow at 63.5% and 76.8% of the original value for the PLA/SapPhB and PETG/SapPhB, respectively, whereas the same components made without PhB had a 100% reduction of airflow. Practical implications: The designed materials can be used for rapid prototyping of medical devices. Originality/value: The new materials have been immediately used in the construction of an emergency lung ventilator, Q-vent, which has been used in different countries during the COVID-19 crisis. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","3D-print; Antimicrobial material; Ceramics; Medical devices; Phloxine B","Cationic surfactants; Diseases; Hybrid materials; Plastic bottles; Rapid prototyping; Reinforced plastics; Silicates; Viruses; Anti-microbial activity; Antimicrobial materials; Design/methodology/approach; Global population; Optimal printing; Physiological environment; Polyethylene terephthalate glycols; Technological progress; 3D printers","","","","","Univerzita Komenského v Bratislave, (UK/163/2017, UK/403/2018); Univerzita Komenského v Bratislave; Agentúra na Podporu Výskumu a Vývoja, APVV, (APVV-15–0347, APVV-18–0075); Agentúra na Podporu Výskumu a Vývoja, APVV","This work was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under contract No. APVV-15–0347, APVV-18–0075 and Grants for Comenius University PhD students and young researchers (UK/163/2017 and UK/403/2018).

Struts with unusual geometries, e.g. dog-bone struts and corrugated struts, are assembled in parallel in a standard lattice unit-cell to obtain the targeted elasto-plastic behavior, here a “whistle-blower” behaviour.

This paper presents a cost-effective method to fabricate ultra-thin and highly sensitive piezoresistive strain sensors. In our fabrication steps, carbon ink that is mainly composed of carbon black particles is solidified with a drying process to form a “paperlike,” flexible conductive film. Without any surface modification techniques, the carbon ink film is directly placed onto liquid-state PDMS and then bonded after the drying process. Following the rapid prototyping, different performance metrics of the fabricated sensors, including piezoresistivity, gauge factor, temperature dependency, elastic modulus, and repeatability are measured. Specifically, sensors fabricated with this method show a significantly improved gauge factor (~26) compared to similar flexible sensors fabricated by more complicated micro-fabrication methods. The proposed method of fabrication and the corresponding ultra-thin (~45 μm) sensor prototype may benefit the design and mass production of future wearable biomedical and healthcare sensors. © 2020, The Author(s).","","Carbon black; Conductive films; Cost effectiveness; Fabrication; Gages; Carbon black particles; Conductive particle; Cost-effective methods; Flexible conductive films; Performance metrics; Piezo-resistive sensors; Surface modification techniques; Temperature dependencies; Wearable sensors","","","","","Qatar Foundation, QF; Qatar National Research Fund, QNRF","This work was made possible by NPRP grant NPRP11S-0104-180192 from the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation).

Existing nerve conduits must make trade-offs between mechanical strength and biocompatibility. Here, we propose a multi-nozzle additive-lathe 3D bioprinting technology to fabricate a bilayered nerve conduit. The materials for printing consisted of gelatin methacrylate (GelMA)-based inner layer, which was cellularized with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and GelMA/poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA)-based outer layer. The high viability and extensive morphological spreading of BMSCs encapsulated in the inner layer was achieved by adjusting the degree of methacryloyl substitution and the concentration of GelMA. Strong mechanical performance of the outer layer was obtained by the addition of PEGDA. The performance of the bilayered nerve conduits was assessed using in vitro culture of PC12 cells. The cell density of PC12 cells attached to cellularized bilayered nerve conduits was more than 4 times of that on acellular bilayered nerve conduits. The proliferation rate of PC12 cells attached to cellularized bilayered nerve conduits was over 9 times higher than that on acellular bilayered nerve conduits. These results demonstrate the additive-lathe 3D bioprinting of BMSCs embedded bilayered nerve conduits holds great potential in facilitating peripheral nerve repair. © 2020 [The Author/The Authors]","Additive-lathe 3D bioprinting; Gelatin methacrylate; Mesenchymal stem cells; Nerve conduit; Neuron outgrowth","gelatin; gelatin methacrylate; GelMA poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate; hydrogel; unclassified drug; animal cell; Article; biocompatibility; bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell; cell culture; cell density; cell proliferation; cell viability; confocal microscopy; nerve compression; nerve conduction; nonhuman; PC12D cell line; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; scanning electron microscopy; tensile strength; three dimensional bioprinting; water absorption; Young modulus","","gelatin, 9000-70-8","Bruker Avance 400, Bruker, Switzerland; DYYB-10; ElectroForce, TA Instruments, United States; Olympus FV1000 BX6, Olympus, Japan; TM-10, Hitachi, Japan","Bruker, Switzerland; Hitachi, Japan; Olympus, Japan; TA Instruments, United States","Key Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong, (2017C01054, 2017C01063); Key Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51821093); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFA0703000); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2019FZA4002, 2019XZZX003‐02); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2018YFA0703000 ), the Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province (Grants No. 2017C01063 , No. 2017C01054 ), the Science Fund for Creative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51821093 ), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant Nos. 2019XZZX003‐02 and 2019FZA4002 ).

However, due to its high Young’s modulus, it has been modified over the years in order to produce a better biomaterial. Tantalum (Ta) has recently emerged as a new potential biomaterial for bone and dental implants. It has been reported to have better corrosion resistance and osteo-regenerative properties as compared to Ti alloys which are most widely used in the bone-implant industry. Currently, Tantalum cannot be widely used yet due to its limited availability, high melting point, and high-cost production. This review paper discusses various manufacturing methods of Tantalum alloys, including conventional and additive manufacturing and also discusses their drawbacks and shortcomings. Recent research includes surface modification of various metals using Tantalum coatings in order to combine bulk material properties of different materials and the porous surface properties of Tantalum. Design modification also plays a crucial role in controlling bulk properties. The porous design does provide a lower density, wider surface area, and more immense specific strength. In addition to improved mechanical properties, a porous design could also escalate the material's biological and permeability properties. With current advancement in additive manufacturing technology, difficulties in processing Tantalum could be resolved. Therefore, Tantalum should be considered as a serious candidate material for future bone and dental implants. © 2021 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.","Bone implant; Porous metal; Porous structure; Surface coating; Tantalum","3D printers; Additives; Biocompatibility; Coatings; Corrosion resistant alloys; Dental alloys; Dental prostheses; Mechanical permeability; Metal implants; Porosity; Tantalum alloys; Titanium alloys; Bone implant; High costs; High melting point; Literature reviews; Metallic implants; Porous metal; Porous structures; Property; Surface coatings; Titanium (alloys); Corrosion resistance","","","","","","","Javaid M., Haleem A., Additive manufacturing applications in orthopaedics: A review, J.

In this study, a novel porous structure, i.e. hierarchical three-dimensional porous (H3DP) structure inspired by the bone in nature is created based on the primitive triply periodic minimal surface sheet structure, which is a basic three-dimensional periodic porous structure consist of triply periodic minimal surfaces. The numerical simulation for the axial crushing of the H3DP structures is carried out using the nonlinear finite element code through LS-DYNA. For accuracy of the numerical results, the finite element model is validated by the experiment performed for H3DP structures which are manufactured by selective laser melting technology using a EOS M290 machine. The numerical results showed that this novel bio-inspired H3DP structure had excellent energy absorption capacity. However, the crashworthiness of the H3DP structure is affected by design parameters such as wall thickness, ribs thickness, number of inner ribs and distance between the inner and outer walls. In order to obtain the optimal design of the H3DP structure with the best crashworthiness, a multi-objective optimization is implemented employing the Kriging (KRG) surrogate modeling method and Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). According to the crashworthiness comparison of the H3DP structure and the traditional energy absorbed structures, it is found that the H3DP structure had relatively higher energy absorption capacity than the primitive sheet structure as well as lots of previous traditional materials or structures in nature and engineering. Thus, the H3DP structure can be used as a good energy absorbing structure and had good application prospect in the field of impact engineering. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Crashworthiness; Kriging surrogate model (KRG); Optimization; Porous structure; Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS)","Automobile manufacture; Biomimetics; Crashworthiness; Energy absorption; Finite element method; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Porosity; Selective laser melting; Application prospect; Energy absorbing structure; Energy absorption capacity; High-energy absorption; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (NSGA II); Non-linear finite elements; Traditional materials; Triply periodic minimal surfaces; Structural design","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11972153, 51706187); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2017JJ3020); State Key Laboratory of Advanced Design and Manufacturing for Vehicle Body, SKLDMVB, (51775001); Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, (11832009, 51621004)","This work is supported jointly by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 11972153 and No. 51706187 ), the fund of State Key Laboratory of Advanced Design and Manufacturing for Vehicle Body (No. 51775001), the Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51621004), the Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.11832009) and Hunan Natural Science Foundation (No. 2017JJ3020).

Most 3D printing technologies are not fully deployed on the industrial scale of aerospace sector, but are rather used for rapid prototyping of components. One of the main potential applications is for them to offer a rapid solution for remote operations, where it is difficult to supply parts. Additive manufactured lattice structures are cellular structures based on biomimicry (inspired from nature lattice structures such as bones, metal crystallography, etc.), that possess many superior properties compared to solid materials and are ideal for fabricating aerospace structures mainly due to the mass reduction they introduce and the high strength-to-weight ratio. Their mechanical properties are defined by the infill percentage, the geometry of the cell structure and the material used in the manufacturing process. © 2021 SBNA.

It is found that FGMs exhibit progressive layer-by-layer deformation mode regardless of unit cell designs and build direction. This deformation behavior is highly favourable for uni-directional impact absorption applications compared to uniform density counterparts with random or diagonal failure. Overall, the EBM-built FGM exhibits superior energy absorption than counterparts of uniform density. Significant improvement in the quasi-elastic gradient and energy absorption is obtained by changing the build direction for specific designs. Compared with other FGM or uniform density lattice structures from the literature, the energy absorption of lattice structures with lower relative density could outperform those with higher relative density by changing the unit cell design or density profile. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","additive manufacturing; compressive properties; electron beam melting; Functionally graded material; lattice structure","3D printers; Aluminum alloys; Deformation; Electron beams; Energy absorption; Fracture mechanics; Titanium alloys; Compressive properties; Deformation behavior; Dimensional accuracy; Elastic gradients; Functionally graded material (FGM); Impact absorption; Lattice structures; Relative density; Functionally graded materials","","","","","3D Additive Manufacturing; SIMTech-NTU Joint Laboratory; Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR, (1325504103)","The work was financially supported by A*STAR Industrial Additive Manufacturing Program: Work Package 3 (Electron Beam Melting, grant number 1325504103) and SIMTech-NTU Joint Laboratory (3D Additive Manufacturing) Project Fund.

This paper introduces a novel fuzzy inference architecture, in which the computational mechanism is based on stochastic logic (SL). First, the basic concept of SL is described, then the architecture of the SL-based fuzzy logic controller (SFLC) is built up systematically using the derived stochastic elements. The second part of the paper demonstrates the application of the proposed techniques, where the SFLC-based control performance is evaluated on a real mechatronic system. The results show that the SL-based approach provides effective and robust control performance, simple architecture and high noise tolerance. The proposed method is also benchmarked against conventional FLCs indicating that the robustness of the stochastic architecture allowed to outperform the benchmark controllers in noisy environments.  © 2013 IEEE.","fuzzy hardware; fuzzy logic controller; self-balancing robot; Stochastic logic","Binary sequences; Controllers; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Robust control; Stochastic systems; Control performance; Fuzzy logic controllers; Mechatronic systems; Noisy environment; Novel architecture; Random binary sequences; Stochastic computing; Stochastic elements; Computer circuits","","","","","European Commission, EC, (2020-4.1.1-TKP2020, EFOP-3.6.1-16-2016-00003)","This work was supported in part by the European Union under Grant EFOP-3.6.1-16-2016-00003 project.

Firstly, based on the FDM theory, the original blasting vibration signal is decomposed to obtain several modal components; then, the dominant component of the signal is filtered according to the dominant frequency of the modal component and its correlation with the original signal; finally, the dominant component is reconstructed to remove the trend item and noise at the same time; spectrum analysis is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the method. The results show that FDM can effectively disperse low-frequency trend items, high-frequency noise, and useful signal information while decomposing signals containing trend terms and noise; compared with the existing common methods, it can more effectively retain the original information, which provides a reference for the trend item and noise removal of similar blasting vibration signals.  © 2021 Hailong Wang et al.","","Blasting; Decomposition; Spectrum analysis; Vibration analysis; Blasting vibration signal; Decomposition methods; Dominant frequency; Fourier decomposition; High-frequency noise; Lower frequencies; Noise interference; Original signal; Removal method; Spectra analysis; Signal processing","","","","","","","Yuan H., Liu X., Bian Y., Analysis of acoustic wave frequency spectrum characters of rock mass under blasting damage based on the HHT method, Advances in Civil Engineering, 2018, 4, (2018); Wu Z., Huang N.E., Ensemble empirical mode decomposition: A noise-assisted data analysis method, Advances in Adaptive Data Analysis, 1, 1, pp. 1-41, (2009); Fu L.J., Wang F.S., Liu Z.N., Application of improved adaptive CEEMD method in denoising of ECG signal, Journal of Electronic Measurement and Instrument, 34, 4, pp. 50-57, (2020); Hassan A.R., Subasi A., Zhang Y.C., Epilepsy seizure detection using complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise, Knowledge-Based Systems, 191, 5, pp. 1-12, (2020); Chen P., Zhao X.Q., Feature extraction of early faults of rolling bearings based on optimized VMD and improved threshold noise reduction, Journal of Vibration and Shock, 40, 13, pp. 146-153, (2021); Li C., Liang S.F., Liu C.P., Cheng J., Liu D.S., Elimination method of trend term of blasting vibration signal based on improved ensemble empirical mode decomposition, Transactions of Beijing Institute of Technology, 41, 6, pp. 636-641, (2021); Jia B., Ling T.L., Hou S.J., Liu D., Wang X., Application of variable mode decomposition in the removal of blasting signal trend items, Explosion and Shock Waves, 40, 4, pp. 123-131, (2020); Zhang L., Ling T.H., Chen Z.H., Zhang S., Yu B., Determining the actual delay time of millisecond blasting based on the improved CEEMDAN method, Journal of Vibration and Shock, 39, 20, pp. 274-280, (2020); Huang J., Gao J., Zhang L., Study on feature signal extraction method of axlebox bearing fault based on wavelet denoising and HHT transformation, Machine Tool & Hydraulics, 48, 10, pp. 50-55, (2020); Shan R.L., Song Y.W., Bai Y., Zhang L., Zhou T., Zhang S., Research on the energy attenuation characteristics of blasting vibration signals based on wavelet packet transformation, Journal of Mining Science and Technology, 3, 2, pp. 119-128, (2018); Li Q.Y., Wang H.W., Wang J.B., Zeng H.D., Zheng J., Research on preprocessing of blasting vibration signal based on EEMD and wavelet threshold, Mining and Metallurgical Engineering, 41, 3, pp. 28-31+36, (2021); Fu X.Q., Yang R.S., Liu J.F., Zhang H., Zhang R., Baseline drift correction and de-noising method of shaft lining vibration signal in near field of freezing vertical shaft blasting, Explosion and Shock Waves, 40, 9, pp. 100-112, (2020); Liu Y., Liu X.B., Liang S., Aeroengine rotor fault diagnosis based on fourier decomposition method, China Mechanical Engineering, 30, 18, pp. 2156-2163, (2019); Jin Z.M., Sun L.P., You G., Lv S., Yi C., Improved Fourier decomposition and its application to fault diagnosis of rolling bearing, Machine Tool & Hydraulics, 49, 6, pp. 163-169, (2021); Fu X.W., Gao X.Q., Rolling bearing fault diagnosis based on FDM and singular value difference spectrum, Acta Metrologica Sinica, 39, 5, pp. 688-692, (2018); Singh P., Joshi S.D., Patney R.K., Saha K., The fourier decomposition method for nonlinear and non-stationary time series analysis, Proceedings.

Specifically, print surface temperature plays a critical role in determining the quality characteristics of the product. Moreover, heat transfer via conduction as a result of spatial correlation between locations on the surface of large and complex geometries necessitates the employment of more robust methodologies to extract and monitor the data. In this article, we propose a framework for real-time data extraction from thermal images and a novel method for controlling layer time during the printing process. A FLIR™ thermal camera captures and stores the stream of images from the print surface temperature, while the Thermwood Large Scale Additive Manufacturing (LSAM™) machine is printing components. A set of digital image processing tasks were performed to extract the thermal data. Separate regression models based on real-time thermal imaging data are built on each location on the surface to predict the associated temperatures. Subsequently, a control method is proposed to find the best time for printing the next layer given the predictions. Finally, several scenarios based on the cooling dynamics of surface structure were defined and analyzed, and the results were compared to the current fixed layer time policy. It was concluded that the proposed method can significantly increase the efficiency by reducing the overall printing time while preserving the quality.
