Therefore, rapid optimization of such characteristics is becoming critical in most clinical and research studies. This paper describes the development of an upgraded 3D printed cuff electrode shell design containing a novel intrinsically conductive polymer (ICP) for stimulation and recording of peripheral nerve fibers. Methods: A 3D stereolithography (SLA) printer was used to print a scalable, custom designed, C-cuff electrode and I-beam closure for accurate, rapid implementation. A novel contact consisting of a percolated carbon graphite base electrodeposited with an intrinsically conductive polymer (ICP), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) produced a PEDOT:PSS + carbon black (CB) matrix that was used to form the electrochemical interface on the structure. Prototype device performance was tested both in-vitro and in-vivo for electrical chemical capacity, electrochemical interfacial impedance, surgical handling, and implantability. The in-vivo work was performed on the sciatic nerve of 25 anesthetized Sprague Dawley rats to demonstrate recording and stimulating ability. Results: Prototypes of different spatial geometries and number of contacts (bipolar, tripolar, and tetrapolar) were designed. The design was successfully printed with inner diameters down to 500 μm. Standard bipolar and tripolar cuffs, with a 1.3 mm inner diameter (ID), 0.5 mm contact width, 1.0 mm pitch, and a 1.5 mm end distance were used for the functional tests. This geometry was appropriate for placement on the rat sciatic nerve and enabled in-vivo testing in anesthetized rats. The contacts on the standard bipolar electrode had an area of 2.1 × 10−2 cm2. Cyclic voltammetry on ICP coated and uncoated graphite contacts showed that the ICP increased the average charge storage capacity (CSC) by a factor of 30. The corresponding impedance at 1 Hz was slightly above 1 kΩ, a 99.99% decrease from 100 kΩ in the uncoated state. The statistical comparison of the pre- versus post-stimulation impedance measurements were not significantly different (p-value > 0.05). Conclusions: The new cuff electrode enables rapid development of cost-effective functional stimulation devices targeting nerve bundles less than 1.0 mm in diameter. This allows for recording and modulation of a low-frequency current targeted within the peripheral nervous system. © 2022 The Authors.

Hereby, this study presents a micro/nano multiphase synergistically reinforced Ti-55Al-7.5Nb/Ti2AlN-Ti5Si3 metal–matrix composite (TiAl MMC) synthesized via direct laser deposition. The as-prepared TiAl MMCs exhibit homogeneously equiaxed grains and no cracks, compared with the coarse columnar microstructure and macro/micro cracks of Ti-55Al-7.5Nb alloy. The grain size of the TiAl MMCs increases in the form of a parabola with increase of the laser power, and also increases from the bottom to the top along the building direction with fixed laser power. Precipitates of Ti2AlN and Ti5Si3 can alleviate the texture index, and thus facilitate an in situ production of isotropic MMCs. Meanwhile, TiAl MMCs feature excellent compressive and high-temperature (900 °C) tensile strength, resulting from the precipitates of rod-like Ti2AlN dispersed inside the grains, and the micro/nano-Ti5Si3 reticularly distributed at the grain boundaries (GBs). The micro/nano multiphase reinforcement could help guide the additive manufacturing of preparing reticular-boundary-reinforced cracks-free TiAl MMCs, which feature controllable microstructures and enhanced mechanical properties. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Finite element method; Laser deposition; Metal–matrix composite; Synergistic reinforcement; TiAl-based alloy","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Cracks; Deposition; Grain boundaries; Metallic matrix composites; Reinforcement; Silicon; Tensile strength; Ternary alloys; Textures; Titanium alloys; Direct laser deposition; Laser depositions; Laser power; Matrix composite; Metal matrix; Metal–matrix composite; Micro/nano; Multiphases; Synergistic reinforcement; TiAl-based alloys; Finite element method","","","","","Funds for Creative Research Groups of China, (51921001); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51831001); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFB3700501); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; National Major Science and Technology Projects of China, (J2019-VII-0016-0156); National Major Science and Technology Projects of China","This work was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2021YFB3700501 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51831001 ), the Funds for Creative Research Groups of China ( 51921001 ), and the National Science and Technology Major Project ( J2019-VII-0016-0156 ).","Appel F., Clemens H., Fischer F.D., Modeling concepts for intermetallic titanium aluminides, Prog.

Here, the advantageous solidification behavior of an Al-Ni-Mg alloy was employed, whereby hot cracking can be omitted through dominant amounts of eutectic solidification. Specimens of this new alloy processed by wire-arc additive manufacturing were investigated in-depth to study the phenomena of microstructure formation and the phenomena governing the mechanical characteristics. For this purpose, the deposits were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, hardness, tensile and fracture toughness testing. Results of microstructure investigations were compared to thermodynamic calculations. The microstructure consists of α-Al/Al3Ni colonies separated by α-Al intercolony regions. Minor amounts of Al3Zr and Mg2Si second phase particles were observed. Mechanical characterization reveals ductile failure after pronounced hardening and substantial isotropic fracture toughness. The mechanical properties are discussed based on the prevalent microstructural characteristics. The presented results provide the basis for future, novel and advanced alloys dedicated for their use in wire-arc additive manufacturing. © 2022 The Author(s)","Aluminum alloys; Eutectic structure; Mechanical properties; Microstructure formation; Wire-arc additive manufacturing","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Differential scanning calorimetry; Eutectics; Fracture testing; Fracture toughness; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Magnesium alloys; Microstructure; Nickel alloys; Scanning electron microscopy; Solidification; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Ternary alloys; Wire; Eutectic structures; Evolution behavior; Hypoeutectics; In-situ composite; Manufacturing phase; Mechanical behavior; Microstructure formation; Phase evolutions; Wire arc; Wire-arc additive manufacturing; 3D printers","","","","","Bundesministerium für Klimaschutz, Umwelt, Energie, Mobilität, Innovation und Technologie, (877340); Österreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft, FFG","This research has been funded by the Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology within the framework “Production of the Future” in the project “DEDAluS – Directed Energy Deposition of Aluminum Structures” (grant agreement no. 877340) administered by FFG.

The oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) bulk material was successfully fabricated using laser-based powder bed fusion (PBF-LB). Micro-scale Y-Al-O complex oxides and nanoscale Y2O3 @TiN core-shell structures were found in the as-built material. The importance of the presence of residual oxygen in the atomization system and the building chamber for the formation of dual-scale secondary phases was revealed. In addition, the formation mechanism of the dual-scale secondary phases was elucidated by investigating the phase and composition of the as-built ODS steel. Columnar crystals with {001}< 100 > cubic alignments grew epitaxially from the bottom of the molten pool during the PBF-LB process, forming a weak cubic texture in the as-built material. This cubic texture led to anisotropic tensile properties of the as-built material, where the room-temperature ultimate tensile strength in the XY-45° direction was higher than that in the building direction (Z). Our work provides a feasible scheme to shorten the preparation process of ODS alloys, which is usually carried out using complicated means. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Cubic texture; Mechanical property; ODS steels; PBF-LB; Precipitates; Residual oxygen","Aluminum alloys; Aluminum compounds; Atomization; Chromium alloys; Dispersions; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Ion beams; Iron alloys; Tensile strength; Yttrium oxide; Cubic texture; Dual scale; Focused ions beams; Laser-based; Oxide dispersions strengthened steels; PBF-LB; Powder bed; Prealloyed powder; Residual oxygen; Secondary phase; Textures","","","","","Major Special Science and Technology Project of Yunnan Province, (202002AB080001-3); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52001001, 52101037); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2021M690821); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","This work was supported by Major Special Science and Technology Project of Yunnan Province (Grant number 202002AB080001-3 ); National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant numbers 52101037 , 52001001 ); and the fellowship of China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant number 2021M690821 ).

Because of the significant resemblance between these skin lesions, physicians spend a lot of time analyzing them. A Deep Learning (DL) based automated categorization system can help clinicians recognize the type of SL and improve the patient's health. In this research, DL approaches such as VGG-16, ResNet-50 and customized model are employed to detect the SL using a smartphone application. These models are trained on the SL classification dataset from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2019. The customized model over fits the other two models with a validation accuracy of 86.21%, whereas the validation accuracy of VGG-16 and ResNet-50 is 85.15% and 84.82%, respectively. Physicians will save time and have a higher precision rate in the automatic classification of SL utilizing DL. © 2022, Ismail Saritas.

The formation of brittle intermetallic compounds (IMCs) at the bonding interface has been the major barrier to safety-critical applications with existing manufacturing processes, including additive manufacturing techniques. This study showed that a combination of a novel modified friction stir additive manufacturing (M-FSAM) and pre-processing surface polishing of the stainless steel enables the formation of a relative homogenously distributed nanoscale amorphous layer along the bonding interface between the 6061 Al and the 304 stainless steel. As a result, the high interfacial bonding strength of 280 MPa was achieved. Compared to the existing friction stir welding/AM processes, M-FSAM enables a significant increase in tool traverse speed and a remarkable reduction in tool cost for Al-Fe bimetallic component manufacturing. The nanoscale amorphous layer consisted of a continuous O and Mg rich layer 10–20 nm in thickness and a discontinuous Al-Fe-Si layer 50–100 nm in thickness. The O and Mg rich layer consisted of an amorphous matrix with nanocrystalline precipitates while the Al-Fe-Si layer consisted of a q-glass with some degree of crystallinity. The formation mechanism of the unique Al-Fe interfacial microstructure was analyzed in detail in this study. © 2022","Amorphization mechanism; Dissimilar metals; Friction stir additive manufacturing; Friction stir welding; Interfacial amorphization; Intermetallic compounds","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum; Aluminum alloys; Amorphization; Amorphous silicon; Binary alloys; Chemical bonds; Crystallinity; Friction; Intermetallics; Microstructure; Nanocrystals; Research laboratories; Amorphization mechanism; Amorphizations; Bi-metallic components; Friction stir; Friction stir additive manufacturing; Friction-stir-welding; Interfacial amorphization; Interfacial microstructure; Intermetallics compounds; Friction stir welding","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (NSF CMMI 2126163); National Science Foundation, NSF; College of Engineering, Michigan State University; University of Michigan, U-M","This work was partially supported by the University of Michigan College of Engineering startup grant and the National Science Foundation (NSF CMMI 2126163 ).

Much effort has gone into investigating the mechanical behavior of L-PBF components; however, few studies investigated their thermal properties. This investigation characterizes the effect of process parameters on the relative density and thermal conductivity of L-PBF AlSi10Mg. Exposure time, laser power, pointwise distance, and build orientation were examined. Results show that changing these parameters can affect the thermal conductivity by up to 22%. For example, build orientation and pointwise distance influenced the thermal conductivity by 12.9% and 10%, respectively. As the pointwise distance increased, both the conductivity and the distance between the melt pool boundaries decreased, whereas the laser power had a negligible effect on both. The effect of exposure time was mainly dependent on the pointwise distance. It is shown that thermal conductivity is not only related to the relative density of the samples, but the number of the melt pool boundaries in the microstructure also plays a significant role in interrupting the heat flow. A new factor is introduced to account for the number of melt pool boundaries per unit length in the direction of heat flow, which helps to explain the variation in thermal conductivity for samples manufactured with high energy densities which had almost negligible difference in relative density.  © 2022 by ASME.","Additive manufacturing (AM); Heat transfer; Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF); Process parameters; Thermal conductivity","3D printers; Fabrication; Lakes; Silicon; Thermal conductivity; Additive manufacturing; Exposure-time; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Laser power; Melt pool; Point wise; Powder bed; Process parameters; Relative density; Heat transfer","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","The authors acknowledge the support of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).","Jafari D., Wits W.

The Mg content was decreased in the additive manufacturing process, and its distribution was not uniform. The Mg content in the central zone of each layer of the additively manufactured wall was lower than that in the adjacent remelting zone. Heat treatment was conducted to observe the microstructure of the WAAM product. The grains in the central and remelting zones of each layer were equiaxial grains, and the grain size in the central zone of each layer was larger than that in the adjacent remelting zone. Existed in the WAAM product, uneven distributions of alloying elements and microstructural differences led to the anisotropy of the mechanical properties. The maximum tensile strength of the transverse specimens was 267.6 MPa, which was 30.9 MPa higher than that of the longitudinal specimens. The maximum fracture elongation of the transverse specimens was 33.9%, while that of the longitudinal specimens was 23.8%. The tensile specimens all exhibited plastic fractures, and the Mg content on the fracture surface of the transverse specimens is higher than the Mg content of the longitudinal specimens. © 2022, ASM International.","anisotropy; element distribution; ER5356 wire; microstructure; WAAM","3D printers; Additives; Alloying elements; Anisotropy; Fracture; Gas metal arc welding; Gas welding; Tensile strength; Wire; Additive manufacturing process; Central zone; Element distribution; Er5356 wire; Gas tungsten arc welding; Gas tungsten-arc welding; Manufacturing products; Mg content; Wire arc; Wire arc additive manufacturing; Microstructure","","","","","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (DUT19JC28); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","The present research is supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities DUT19JC28.

The increasingly widespread use of CT and/or MR imaging for pre-surgical assessment, and the emergence of additive manufacturing processes such as 3D printing, could enable bespoke devices to be produced efficiently and cost-effectively. However, 3D printed metallic stents need to be self-supporting leading to limitations in their design. In this study, we investigate the use of etching to overcome these design constraints and improve stent surface finish. Furthermore, using a combination of experimental bench testing and finite element (FE) methods we investigate how etching influences stent performance. Then using an inverse finite element approach the material properties of the printed and etched stents were calibrated and compared. We show that without etching the titanium stents, the inverse FE approach underestimates the stiffness of the as-built stent (E = 33.89 GPa) when compared to an average of 76.84 GPa for the etched stent designs. Finally, using patient-specific finite element models the different stents’ performance were tested to assess patient outcomes and lumen gain and vessel stresses were found to be strongly influenced by the stent design and postprocessing. Within this study, etching is confirmed as a means to create open-cell stent designs whilst still conforming to additive manufacturing ‘rules’ and concomitantly improving stent surface finish. Additionally, the feasibility of using an in-vivo imaging-to-product development pipeline is demonstrated that enables patient-specific stents to be produced for varying anatomies to achieve optimum device performance. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Cardiovascular stents; Etching; Finite element modelling; Patient-specific","3D printers; Additives; Computerized tomography; Finishing; Finite element method; Magnetic resonance imaging; Pediatrics; Stents; Titanium; titanium; Cardiovascular stents; Design constraints; Element models; Finite element modeling; Inverse finite element approaches; Patient specific; Performance; Stent design; Surface finishes; Titania; aortic coarctation; Article; chemical composition; chemical procedures; child; clinical article; comparative study; computer aided design; etching; feasibility study; finite element analysis; geometry; human; image segmentation; interferometry; inverse finite element analysis; left common carotid artery; left subclavian artery; preschool child; prosthesis design; qualitative analysis; rigidity; scanning electron microscopy; selective laser melting; stereoscopic vision; surface property; treatment outcome; white light interferometry; Young modulus; Etching","","titanium, 7440-32-6","","","National Children's Research Centre, NCRC, (G/19/3); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/R001650/1); Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, (12/RC/2278_2); Irish Research Council, (GOIPD/2019/222)","This study was funded National Children's Research Centre , Crumlin (Grant No. G/19/3 ), an Irish Research Council Government of Ireland Postdoctoral Fellowship (2019) ( GOIPD/2019/222 ) and from research supported in part by a research grant from Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) under the grant number 12/RC/2278_2 .

The microstructure of the Ti-5Cu was mainly composed of α Ti laths, Ti2Cu and retained β phases, while the B4C/Ti-5Cu composite was composed of α Ti laths, Ti2Cu, TiC, TiB and TiB2 phases. Both the Cu and B4C additions promoted a transition from columnar to equiaxed grains for prior-β and α phases. The B4C/Ti-5Cu composite was found to have a higher hardness (467 HV) than the Ti-5Cu (417 HV). Further, the composite exhibits a yield strength of 1100 MPa and an ultimate tensile strength of 1250 MPa. Values which are higher than those of the Ti-5Cu that exhibits a yield strength of 750 MPa and an ultimate tensile strength of 900 MPa. However, this strength increase comes at the expense of a reduction in elongation to failure from 6.2% to 1.5%. Even though the composite is significantly stronger, the two materials exhibited very similar wear rates (ωB4C/Ti-5Cu = 4.95 × 10−4 mm3 N−1 m−1 and ω Ti-5Cu = 4.85 × 10−4 mm3 N−1 m−1). © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Composite; Laser powder bed fusion; Mechanical properties; Titanium‑copper alloy; Wear rate","Boron carbide; Copper alloys; Fabrication; Friction; Tensile strength; Textures; Titanium alloys; Titanium carbide; Tribology; Wear of materials; Yield stress; In-situ composite; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Mechanical and tribological properties; Microstructure mechanical properties; Powder bed; Titania; Titania‑copper alloy; Ultimate tensile strength; Wear-rate; Binary alloys","","","","","Sinoma Institute of Materials Research; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52071346); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities of the Central South University, (2021zzts0098); Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities of the Central South University","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52071346) and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Central South University (Grant No. 2021zzts0098).

Recent developments in magnetically tunable microwave/RF components are attractive for externally controlled circuits without influencing RF characteristics. This letter focuses on additive manufacturing of ferroic nanomaterials along with their implementation in frequency-tuned RF circuits using an applied magnetic field. Extraction of the additively manufactured magneto-dielectric composite was performed at $S$ -band frequencies using least squares curve fitting of measured and simulated $S$ -parameters for annular ring resonator modes. Polylactide (PLA) material used for additive manufacturing was extracted to have $\varepsilon = 1.80 - j0.031$. Meanwhile, magnetic CoFe2O4 with 45-nm average nanoparticles size was extracted to have $\varepsilon $ = $3.10 - j0.084$ and $\mu $ = $1.70 - j0.145$ ; while Protopasta's magnetic filament had $\varepsilon $ = $1.80 - j0.031$ and $\mu $ = $2.19 - j0.569$. The 3-D printed magnetic composite is used to design tunable annular ring resonators at 2.4 GHz with up to 38-MHz frequency tuning for an applied 1-kG magnetic field.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Additive manufacturing; annular ring resonator; cobalt ferrite nanoparticles; electromagnetic extraction; finite element method (FEM)","3D printers; Additives; Cobalt; Curve fitting; Extraction; Iron compounds; Magnetic fields; Nanomagnetics; Nanoparticles; Optical resonators; Annular ring resonator; Annular rings; Cobalt ferrite nanoparticles; Electromagnetic extraction; Electromagnetics; Finite element method; Frequency characterization; Radio frequency circuit; Radiofrequencies; Ring resonator; Finite element method","","","","","","","Daryoush A., Choe B., Optically reconfigured active phased array antennas, Microw.

However, the coherent summation of carriers in the OFDM system leads to a high peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR), causing non-linear clipping distortion at the transmitting light-emitting diode. This intricacy becomes a potential barrier for intensity modulation and limits the VLC systems' bandwidth. In the literature, non-distorting PAPR lowering approaches, such as the selective mapping (SLM) approach, have been confirmed as the most effective strategy for reducing ineludible high PAPR in optical OFDM systems among all other available techniques. Besides its astounding performance, the computational complexity also becomes a major complication in SLM due to the generation of multiple candidates. This paper proposes a computational complexity minimisation approach using inherit system properties in the SLM-based PAPR suppression method for VLC systems, where the phase sequence vectors are considered periodic. The alternative direct current-biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing candidates for the single frequency-domain data block are generated with the periodic phase rotation vector. The evaluation of the complexity analysis and the simulation results shows that the mitigation of computational complexity surpasses the standard SLM technique. © 2022 The Authors.

The high cycle fatigue performance of a weight-optimised bracket made using the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process was studied through shaker table testing. The results are discussed together with the observed mechanical and fatigue strengths in conjunction with material characterisation of microstructure, surface roughness, defects, micro-hardness and fracture surfaces. The debits in mechanical and fatigue strengths are expected due to process dependent surface roughness and the density of defects present. From the shaker table test results, it was concluded that the proposed weight-optimised LPBF bracket is capable of meeting the performance targets. The fundamental vibration mode of the bracket assembly was 84 Hz, which was much higher than the 1st Low Pressure shaft speed (48 Hz) of the target engine and thus avoids potential resonance. The bracket achieved its target inertial g load capability of 20 g and it was demonstrated that the bracket had enough redundancy in its load transfer paths should a strut fail during service of the engine. Lack of fusion voids and micro-cracks present on or near the surface were the prime sites for crack initiation. It has been shown that the as-built surface can cause a significant reduction (up to 40%) in the fatigue strength when compared to machined Ti-6Al-4V. A safe life regime for LPBF component design has been presented based on the Kitagawa-Takahasi diagram, modified using the Chapetti curve, which effectively links the material fatigue properties and performance of LPBF parts with intrinsic defects. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Failure mechanism; g load capability; High cycle fatigue; Laser powder bed fusion; Vibration mode","Aircraft engines; Aluminum alloys; Cracks; Engines; Failure (mechanical); Microhardness; Surface roughness; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Failure mechanism; Fatigue performance; G load capability; G-loads; High cycle fatigue; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Load capability; Powder bed; Vibration modes; High-cycle fatigue","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/R004951/1); Rolls-Royce; University of Nottingham","We thank Rolls-Royce plc and the EPSRC for the support under the Prosperity Partnership Grant \ Cornerstone: Mechanical Engineering Science to Enable Aero Propulsion Futures, Grant Ref:EP/R004951/1.

In this study, stainless steels 308LSi and 304 were used as WAAM feedstock and substrate, respectively, for additive manufacturing of two typical structures, namely wall and pipe structures. A thermomechanical coupling analysis model for WAAM was developed to investigate the formation mechanism of residual stresses in both structures, and their relationship with the deposition height and shape. The validity of the analysis was evaluated by comparing the simulated residual stresses with those measured by the contour method. Regardless of the wall or pipe structure, the tensile longitudinal (or circumferential) residual stress exists on the WAAM top surface and has the largest value (~300 MPa) at the position of several layers below the top surface. The distribution pattern of the longitudinal (or circumferential) residual stress is tensile in the layers near the top surface, compressive in the layers near the substrate surface, and tensile near the bottom surface of the substrate. This distribution pattern reaches a quasi-stable state when the total deposition height is greater than a certain size (~10 mm and 15 mm for wall and pipe structures, respectively). For the pipe structure, however, the residual stress distribution is not symmetric along the height direction. This analysis model can provide guidance for effective tailoring of residual stresses in WAAM components. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Contour method; Distribution characteristics;

The printed specimens were then subjected to annealing treatments in a range of 700 °C to 1200 °C to investigate the evolution of the microstructure using electron backscatter diffraction mapping and a five-parameter analysis of the grain boundary character distribution. The post-printing annealing treatment resulted in microstructural changes in respect to grain shape and size, the grain boundary character distribution and the overall texture. However, the extent of these changes strongly depended on the annealing temperature. The grain structure and overall texture changed only modestly when annealed below 900 °C. The grains grew by about 10 pct and this led to a small (≈ 15 pct) increase in the areas of boundaries with low energy (111) planes at the expense of higher energy grain boundary planes with the (001) orientation. Static recrystallization was the dominant microstructure evolution mechanism at annealing temperatures greater than 1000 °C, where new equiaxed grains replaced the initial printed microstructure, enhancing the relative areas of low energy grain boundaries (i.e., ∑ 3 and ∑ 9) by a factor of more than five. This change increased the population of boundaries with the low energy (111) plane by a factor of five and decreased the strength of the texture by more than 50 pct through twinning. The resultant microstructure is expected to ultimately improve the material properties, where the increase in the relative areas of ∑ 3 boundaries would enhance the corrosion resistance and fracture toughness of material, and the texture weakening diminishes the anisotropy in mechanical behaviour. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Annealing; Corrosion resistance; Fracture toughness; Grain boundaries; Grain size and shape; Annealing temperatures; Annealing treatments; Grain boundary character distributions; Grain boundary network; Laser powders; Lower energies; Networks evolutions; Post printing; Powder bed; Texture boundary; Textures","","","","","Deakin University","Deakin University’s Advanced Characterization Facility is acknowledged for use of the EBSD instruments.

To study the heat accumulation during 316L steel based parts manufactured by LPBF, a finite element method (FEM) based numerical study is carried out. For the investigation, a computationally efficient FEM based model, where the whole layer is simultaneously exposed to a heat source, is used. The simulation results are compared with experimental results to validate the numerical model. While considering different influencing factors such as volumetric energy density (VED) and inter-layer time (ILT), the FEM model is shown to successfully simulate the process of heat accumulation during LPBF based manufacturing of a cuboidal shaped geometry. It is shown that ILT and VED have a significant effect on heat accumulation. The validated numerical model provides a good basis for the optimization of processing parameters and geometries for a future investigation of a reduction of heat accumulation effects. Furthermore, it can be used to quickly provide preheating boundary conditions for detailed investigations by different model approaches at a finer scale for future studies. © 2022, The Author(s).","Finite element method; Heat accumulation; Inter-layer time; Laser powder bed fusion","","","","","","British Academy of Management, BAM","This research was funded by BAM within the focus area Materials.

The bioink used for 3D bioprinting incorporates living cells. During printing, cells suspended in the bioink sediment to form cell aggregates through cell-cell interaction. The formation of cell aggregates due to cell sedimentation have been widely recognized as a significant challenge to affect the printing reliability and quality. This study has incorporated the active circulation into the bioink reservoir to mitigate cell sedimentation and aggregation. Force and velocity analysis were performed, and a circulation model has been proposed based on iteration algorithm with the time step for each divided region. It has been found that (a) the comparison of the cell sedimentation and aggregation with and without the active bioink circulation has demonstrated high effectiveness of active circulation to mitigate cell sedimentation and aggregation for the bioink with both a low cell concentration of 1 × 106 cells ml−1 and a high cell concentration of 5 × 106 cells ml−1; and (b) the effect of circulation flow rate on cell sedimentation and aggregation has been investigated, showing that large flow rate results in slow increments in effectiveness. Besides, the predicted mitigation effectiveness percentages on cell sedimentation by the circulation model generally agrees well with the experimental results. In addition, the cell viability assessment at the recommended maximum flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1 has demonstrated negligible cell damage due to the circulation. The proposed active circulation approach is an effective and efficient approach with superior performance in mitigating cell sedimentation and aggregation, and the resulting knowledge is easily applicable to other 3D bioprinting techniques significantly improving printing reliability and quality in 3D bioprinting. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.","bioink circulation; cell aggregation; cell concentration; cell sedimentation; mitigation","Bioprinting; Cell Survival; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Reproducibility of Results; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; 3D printers; Aggregates; Cytology; Damage detection; Iterative methods; Sedimentation; Suspended sediments; Bioink circulation; Bioprinting; Cell aggregates; Cell aggregation; Cell concentrations; Cell sedimentation; Circulation models; Ink jet; Mitigation; Picoliters; bioprinting; cell survival; procedures; reproducibility; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; Cells","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CMMI-1762282); National Science Foundation, NSF","This study was partially supported by the US National Science Foundation (CMMI-1762282).","Ford S L, Additive manufacturing technology: potential implications for US manufacturing competitiveness, J.

However, the carbon fibre composites produced using current state-of-the-art AM approaches generally possess high porosity (18–25 %) compared to those produced by conventional manufacturing (1 %). An approach known as composite fibre additive manufacturing (CFAM) is presented, involving selectively printing a binder and polymer powder onto discontinuous carbon fibre sheets, which are then compressed, heated and post-processed to form net shape components. The results demonstrate a correlation between compaction pressure applied and porosity/fibre volume fraction within components. Composite components were produced containing porosity of 1.5 % and fibre volume content of 15 % with 97 MPa tensile strength and 8.9 GPa elastic modulus, presenting a new approach for production of discontinuous carbon fibre reinforced polymer parts with mechanical properties exceeding those of state-of-the-art AM. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites; Mechanical properties; Sheet lamination; X-ray computed tomography","Additives; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Computerized tomography; Density (specific gravity); Porosity; Tensile strength; % reductions; Carbon fiber reinforced; Carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite; Design freedom; Fiber reinforced thermoplastics; Improved designs; Reinforced thermoplastic composites; Sheet lamination; State of the art; X-ray computed tomography; 3D printers","","","","","University of Sheffield; Turkish Ministry of Education; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/P006566/1)","B.

The LP-DED process has been matured for alloys including stainless steels, superalloys, and titanium, but has had very limited research using copper-based alloys, which are important for applications that require high thermal conductivity. This study quantifies the size effects on microstructure, surface metrology, microhardness, and mechanical response to tensile loads for different thicknesses and powder compositions of hot isostatic pressed (HIP) LP-DED Copper-Chromium-Niobium alloy, specifically GRCop-42. To accomplish this, tensile specimens were sectioned from single track build walls in both horizontal and vertical orientations to also investigate possible anisotropic behavior in the part. Results show that microstructure, hardness, surface metrology, and porosity are independent of wall thickness. Uniaxial loading response showed some variations with specimens orientation and size effects. For vertical specimens, thicker specimens showed a 6% higher elongation than thinner specimens. Horizontal specimens showed close to double the elongation when compared to vertical specimens, where thinner specimens had a higher reduction in elongation than thicker specimens. Additionally, removing the surface effects through polishing practically eliminated the anisotropic behavior between horizontal and vertical specimens along with the observed size effects. To demonstrate size effects dependency on the manufacturing process comparison is made between GRCop-42 alloy produced by Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) and LP-DED. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive Manufacturing; Direct Energy Deposition; Microstructure; Size Effects; Thin-Walled Structures","3D printers; Anisotropy; Copper alloys; Deposition; Elongation; Nickel alloys; Niobium alloys; Size determination; Thin walled structures; Anisotropic behaviors; Direct energy deposition; Directed energy; Energy depositions; Large components; Laser powders; Sizes effect; Surface metrology; Thin walls; Thin-walled structures; Microstructure","","","","","Colton Katsarelis and Darren Tinker; RPMI; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (80NSSC21M0319); National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA","Funding text 1: This paper describes objective technical results and analysis under National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) contract number 80NSSC21M0319.

This study explored the hot-wire arc additive manufacturing (HWAAM) of the 7055 alloy, and proposed a three-stage solution and aging heat treatment method to further improve its mechanical properties. Both as-deposited and heat treated samples were mainly composed of equiaxed grains. Within grains of the as-deposited sample, the Mg(Zn,Cu)2 were precipitated. After heat treatment, apart from the small and abundant Mg(Zn,Cu)2 precipitates, the Al3Zr were also precipitated. Crack-free 7055 alloy parts were obtained, and the low porosity of as-deposited and heat treated samples were 0.18 % and 0.26 %, respectively. In addition, the alternating clustered-pore zones and discrete-pore zones were observed in both samples. After heat treatment, UTS and elongation were 563 ± 7 MPa and 10.0 ± 1.2 %, respectively, and negligible mechanical anisotropy of Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys was obtained. The good properties, which reached the wrought level, were attributed to the equiaxed grains and low porosity, as well as abundant strengthening phases. This work demonstrated the potential of additive manufacturing to fabricate alloys with unique microstructures and high performance for structural applications. © 2022","Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys; Grain morphologies; Hot-wire arc additive manufacturing; Mechanical properties; Pores; Strengthening precipitates","3D printers; Additives; Binary alloys; Copper alloys; Heat treatment; High strength alloys; Magnesium alloys; Porosity; Textures; Wire; Zinc alloys; Zircaloy; After-heat treatment; Equi-axed grains; Grain morphologies; Hot wires; Hot-wire arc additive manufacturing; Low porosity; Performance; Pore; Strengthening precipitate; Wire arc; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Department of Mechanical and Energy Engineering; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51875041, 52105319); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Beijing Institute of Technology, BIT; Southern University of Science and Technology, SUSTech","Funding text 1: The work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51875041, 52105319).

However, landfills consist mainly of soil-like material (SLM) which is of little or no economic value. The aim of the present study is to provide a global overview of SLM in terms of heavy metal concentrations and its resource potential. As references for the resource assessment served metal concentrations in ores, thresholds for compost and earthworks, and abundance in Earth's crust. The preparation of a meta-analysis included 573 chemical analyses from 59 landfills in 12 countries. Average concentrations of arsenic, zinc and nickel turned out to be quite similar worldwide, whereas those of lead, copper and mercury showed remarkable differences between the landfills. Chromium, nickel, lead and zinc concentrations proved to exceed most likely compost, while arsenic and mercury concentrations remained usually below thresholds. With regard to a reuse of SLM in earthworks, elevated zinc concentrations were most of concern, followed by lead, copper, chromium and cadmium. However, chromium and nickel concentrations were found to be most similar to abundances in Earth's crust. Heavy metal concentrations in SLM were worldwide not comparable to those found in ores. Moreover, we observed that the option of multiple metal recovery did not improve significantly the resource potential. © 2022","Fines; Heavy metals; Landfill mining; Meta-analysis; Soil recycling","Arsenic; Bioaccumulation; Chemical analysis; Chromium; Copper; Excavation; Foundations; Land fill; Mercury (metal); Metal recovery; Nickel; Soil pollution; Zinc; Chromium concentration; Earth's crust; Fine; Heavy metal concentration; Landfill mining; Meta-analysis; Nickel concentrations; Resource potentials; Soil recycling; Soil-like materials; Soils","","","","","Bavarian State Office for Environment; Gesellschaft zur Altlastensanierung in Bayern mbH; Bayerisches Landesamt für Umwelt, LfU","We would like to acknowledge the support of the participating municipalities and companies, the Bayerisches Landesamt für Umwelt (Bavarian State Office for Environment) and the Gesellschaft zur Altlastensanierung in Bayern mbH (remediation corporation in Bavaria).

This study presents an approach for manufacturing Al/C composites utilizing a high energy ball milling and laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process. We prepared Al/C60 and Al/MWCNT composites under 25 different conditions to observe their microstructure and mechanical property trends according to laser power and scan speed. The relative density of LPBFed composites increased as the energy density increased due to the oxide layer present on the aluminum surface and the high laser reflectance. It was found that, as the energy density increased, the increase in nanohardness and elastic modulus of the LPBFed composites was due to the high relative density. However, the high laser power condition of 179 W resulted in the softening of materials due to grain coarsening, resulting in a decrease in nanohardness and elastic modulus. Under the same laser conditions, the nanohardness of the LPBFed Al/2 vol.% MWCNT composites was approximately 0.5 GPa higher than that of the LPBFed Al/1 vol.% C60 composites, which is explained by the high relative density and grain refinement strengthening. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","","Aluminum;

The microstructure, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance of the composite coatings were studied. Spherical or near-spherical tungsten carbide (WC) particles are dispersively distributed in the coatings, resulting in the appearance of obvious WC and TiW2C phases. And the composite coatings mainly consist of body-centered cubic (BCC) and face-centered cubic (FCC). When x ≤ 0.3, the addition of WC enhances the BCC diffraction peak. Microhardness of the composite coatings with WC increases and is much higher than that of the substrate (280.6 HV0.1). The hardness of the CrFeMoNiTi(WC)0.3 (1005.1 HV0.1) is the highest among the composite coatings. The retained WC particles and BCC acted as load bearers during the friction process, which reduces the wear loss of the composite coating. Also, the anodic protection caused by the corrosion-resistant WC particles and BCC greatly improves the ability of the composite coatings to resist NaCl attack. Hence, CrFeMoNiTi(WC)0.3 exhibited the optimum wear resistance and corrosion resistance. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","composite coatings; corrosion resistance; high-entropy alloys; selective laser melting; WC particles; wear resistance","Composite coatings; Corrosion resistant coatings; Entropy; High-entropy alloys; Melting; Microstructure; Sodium chloride; Tungsten carbide; Wear of materials; Wear resistance; Body-centred cubic; Composites coating; Face-centred cubic; High entropy alloys; Microstructure and properties; Microstructure wear; Q235 carbon steels; Selective laser melting; WC particles; Wear corrosion; Corrosion resistance","","","","","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2018M632313); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","This study was supported by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (grant number 2018M632313) and the Jiangsu Overseas Visiting Scholar Program for University Prominent Young & Middle‐aged Teachers and Presidents.

We have 3D printed a series of porous materials coupons by varying laser parameters such as scan speed and laser power. This is shown to be a successful strategy for four different materials: AlSi10Mg, Stainless steel 316L, Inconel 625 and Ti-6Al-4V. The resulting porous material is characterized with measurements of the effective pore radius, permeability and the porosity to assess the performance. The experimental results lead to the definition of a process window of laser parameters that can be used to fabricate metal porous materials for each of the specified materials. Within this process window, we show that it is possible to obtain porous materials with pore radii ranging from 1.1 to 28.1 μm, porosity ranging from 10.4 to 42.4% and permeability ranging from 5.9 × 10–16 to 4.4 × 10–12 m2. This is solely achieved by varying laser parameters. We also describe models to predict porous material’s properties. Based on experimental results, we show that porosity can be controlled by varying laser parameters and, especially, applying appropriate energy density. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Additive manufacturing; Energy density; Heat pipe; Porous materials; Powder bed fusion; Two-phase thermal control","","","","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (80NM0018D0004); National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA","The research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (80NM0018D0004).","Faghri A., Heat pipes: Review, opportunities and challenges, Front Heat Pipes, 5, 1, (2014); Daimaru T., Et al., Development of an evaporator using porous wick structure for a two-phase mechanically pumped fluid loop, Proceedings of 49Th International Conference on Environmental Systems, (2019); Ranjan R., Et al., Analysis of the wicking and thin-film evaporation characteristics of microstructures.

Uniaxial tests are performed in both tension and compression, and the cantilever samples are tested using digital image correlation (DIC)-augmented-bending test methodology, which is a way of establishing creep parameters in high throughput fashion. In each test condition, the applied normal stress is along the transverse direction relative to the build direction. The creep response of the alloy exhibits a tension-compression symmetry in terms of the steady-state and minimum creep rates. Correlations of uniaxial and high throughput bending creep tests reveal an excellent correspondence, thereby establishing the viability of evaluating creep behavior via bending, as a first of its kind, for additively manufactured Al alloys. Detailed electron microscopy of the crept specimens revealed the stability of microstructure during the prolonged exposures up to 500 h (during uniaxial creep) and the pinning of dislocations by intra-granular Si (20–50 nm) particles.

In this paper, a 4D behavior was investigated using Near Infrared (NIR) light in combination with a low amount of NIR organic dyes in-situ embedded in the 3D printed object. As a first step, the influence of several parameters on the photothermal effect generated have been followed such as the NIR dye structure, the NIR dye concentration, the irradiation wavelength, the light irradiance and the polymer matrix. Due to the light-triggered process, the deformation of the 3D printed object could be reversibly achieved in the presence of a NIR organic dye in a few amount of time (20 s). In fact, the photothermal effect in-situ generated in the 3D printed object allowed to reach a temperature above the gel transition temperature (Tg) of the latter. This phenomenon has been highlighted with tensile tests. Indeed, these tests showed the passage of the 3D printed object from a glassy state to a rubbery state upon NIR irradiation. Finally, the photothermal effect produced was used to rapidly bond or repair two parts of a broken 3D printed object. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","4D printing; Photopolymerization; Photopolymers; Photothermal effect","3D printers; Infrared devices; Irradiation; Photopolymers; Tensile testing; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; 4d printing; Near Infrared; Near-infrared; Near-infrared dyes; Organic dye; Photo polymerization; Photo-thermal; Photothermal effects; Photopolymerization","","","","","Agence Nationale de la recherche (France), (ANR-19-CE07-0042)","The authors thank the Region Grand Est (France) for the MIPPI-4D funding and the Agence Nationale de la recherche (France) for the funding of this work (ANR-19-CE07\u20130042).","Hahladakis J.N., Iacovidou E., Closing the loop on plastic packaging materials: what is quality and how does it affect their circularity?, Sci.

We input the result in the Serrano–Liška (SL) gravity theory to discuss the corresponding Neutron Star (NS) properties. We have shown that the upper bound for the GUP parameter from nuclear matter properties is β≤ 2 × 10 - 7 MeV- 2. If we used this β upper bound to calculate NS matter, and considering SL parameter c~ as an independent parameter, we have found that the upper bound for the SL parameter, which modifies the Einstein field equation, is c~ ≤ 10 7 m2. This beta upper bound is determined by considering the anisotropy magnitude smaller than the pressure magnitude. By employing β= 2 × 10 - 7 MeV- 2 and c~ = 10 7 m2, we obtain the mass–radius relation that satisfies NICER data for both PSR J0740+6620 (whose mass is ∼ 2.1 M⊙) and PSR J0030+0451 (M∼ 1.4 M⊙). Our GUP parameter upper bound perfectly matches the constraint from 87Rb cold-atom-recoil experiment. If we consider that the same strength from the additional logarithmic term in the entropy from both GUP and SL model are dependent, for β< 2 × 10 - 7 MeV- 2, it is clear that SL parameter lower bound is c~ > - 16 × 10 - 34 m2. The magnitude of this bound is 10 - 40 smaller than the upper bound magnitude of SL parameter considering as independent parameter i.e., c~ ≤ 10 7 m2. © 2022, The Author(s).","","","","","","","Sampoerna University, (011/IRG/SU/AY.2021-2022)","IHB acknowledges the Sampoerna University internal Grant 011/IRG/SU/AY.2021-2022.

We study the potential of low-cost copper-nickel alloys for active cooling applications. We show that for this application, copper-nickel alloys prepared using industrial-grade powders to lower the manufacturing cost, are as good as copper-nickel alloys made out of high purity metals. Furthermore, directed energy deposition, a type of additive manufacturing, can produce copper-nickel alloys which have about 10 percent lower thermoelectric power factor compared to mechanical-alloying methods but have larger thermal conductivity values, hence, possessing similar effective thermal conductivity values, reaching 403 Wm−1K−1at 390K. Much larger values are expected at higher temperatures.

This paper introduces a new approach to characterizing internal defects and surface irregularities of additively manufactured stainless steel 316L samples using X-ray computed tomography (XCT). This method overcomes the limitations of previous methods and can effectively provide holistic information on the surface topologies of AM components. An equivalent defect size, areaeff, based on defects’ features and the interaction of internal and surface imperfections, is proposed for fatigue life and failure origins prediction. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing;

This is of practical importance for lenses fabricated using additive manufacturing, allowing accurate prediction of performance, and potentially reducing overall print time. It is shown that the farfield relative side lobe level (RSLL) is most sensitive to this form of discretization, and the impact to multi-feed and single-feed applications is considered. It is shown that for single-feed applications, large cubic macro cells are beneficial and provide a RSLL above that achieved with the continuous and non-uniform shelled counterparts. © 2022 River Publishers.

In particular, we aimed at clarifying the parameters inside the material that would better represent the strength in the thickness direction. First, the nozzle temperature was varied and the printed crystallinity, void fraction and interlaminar strength were measured. High strength was observed at both ends of the printable temperature whereas a minimum was observed at the intermediate temperature. Although the relationship between the strength, crystallinity, and void fraction was obtained, no clear trend was observed. The filament bundle deformation due to melting was focused on by observing the entire cross-section, and the extent of the deformation was quantified by defining the filament area fraction. The same trends between the strength and filament area fraction were obtained for the temperature change. In addition, the mechanism underlying the change in the filament area fraction with increasing nozzle temperature was explained. © 2022 The Author(s)","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Carbon fiber; Strength","","","","","","Joint Center for Aerospace Technology Innovation, JCATI; Toray Industries","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge that this study was made possible through support from the Joint Center for Aerospace Technology Innovation (JCATI).

This plasma device was designed to allow direct installation of sealed implant packaging containing the dental implant. In this manner, the dental implant could be treated with plasma under a moderate vacuum environment while remaining in a sterile condition. To assess the osseointegration efficiency, in vitro experiments using sandblasted, large grit, acid etching (SLA), calcium coated-SLA (CaSLA), and calcium coated-SLA with plasma treatment (PCaSLA) were performed. The implant surface was observed with scanning electron microscope (SEM) before and after plasma treatment. Thereafter, protein adsorption, cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation efficiency were investigated on the surface of each implant type using saos-2, an osteoblast. Plasma treatment significantly improved protein adsorption, cell adhesion, and cell proliferation efficiency compared to both CaSLA and SLA without damaging the calcium coating. According to the findings, the proposed vacuum plasma device has shown the potential to improve osseointegration efficiency. We believe that this plasma technology can be an innovative chairside solution that can be easily handled in the clinical field with superb usability. © 2022 by the authors.","osseointegration; osteoblast adhesion; osteoblast proliferation; plasma treatment; protein adsorption; vacuum plasma-treated implant","","","","","","Plasmapp Co., Ltd.; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2022R1A2C2010940); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Ministry of SMEs and Startups, MSS","Funding text 1: H.J.J., J.S.S., J.Y.K., Y.L. are employees of Plasmapp Co., Ltd.

By a novel quasi-in-situ electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) method, the recrystallization of SLM IN718 is primarily dominated by strain-induced boundary migration (SIBM) at 1,150 or 1,075 °C via statistical analysis. In particular, AGG at 1,150 °C is attributed to quick consumption of the high-strain regions due to a higher grain boundary (GB) velocity, while fine grains at 1,075 °C attributed to activation of more SIBM grains and uniform growth of these grains due to a slower GB velocity. The techniques proposed in this study can also work well for other SLM face-centered cubic alloys. © 2022 Acta Materialia Inc.","Abnormal grain growth; Electron backscatter diffraction; Grain refining; Inconel 718; Selective laser melting","Backscattering; Electron diffraction; Grain boundaries; Grain growth; Selective laser melting; Textures; Abnormal grain growth; Electron back scatter diffraction; Electron backscatter diffraction; Finer grains; Grain refining; Inconel-718; Narrow temperature ranges; Recrystallisation; Selective laser melting; Strain induced boundary migrations; Recrystallization (metallurgy)","","","","","","","Fayed E.M., Saadati M., Shahriari D., Brailovski V., Jahazi M., Medraj M., Sci.

To date, functional trachea regeneration with alternant cartilage-fibrous tissue-mimetic structure similar to that of the native trachea relying on the three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technology has seen very limited breakthrough. This fact is mostly due to the lack of tissue-specific bioinks suitable for both cartilage and vascularized fibrous tissue regeneration, as well as the need for firm interfacial integration between stiff and soft tissues. Here, a novel strategy is developed for 3D bioprinting of cartilage-vascularized fibrous tissue-integrated trachea (CVFIT), utilizing photocrosslinkable tissue-specific bioinks. Both cartilage- and fibrous tissue-specific bioinks created by this study provide suitable printability, favorable biocompatibility, and biomimetic microenvironments for chondrogenesis and vascularized fibrogenesis based on the multicomponent synergistic effect through the hybrid photoinitiated polymerization reaction. As such, the tubular analogs are successfully bioprinted and the ring-to-ring alternant structure is tightly integrated by the enhancement of interfacial bonding through the amidation reaction. The results from both the trachea regeneration and the in situ trachea reconstruction demonstrate the satisfactory tissue-specific regeneration along with realization of mechanical and physiological functions. This study thus illustrates the 3D-bioprinted native tissue-like trachea as a promising alternative for clinical trachea reconstruction. © 2022 The Authors.

MicroRNAs (miRs) have emerged as significant tools to regulate the differentiation and proliferation of osteogenic and chondrogenic formation in the human musculoskeletal system. Here, we describe a novel approach to osteochondral reconstruction based on the three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting of miR-transfected adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) spheroids to produce a heterotypic interface that addresses the intrinsic limitations of the traditional approach to inducing zonal differentiation via the use of diffusible cytokines. We evaluated the delivery of miR-148b for osteogenic differentiation and the codelivery of miR-140 and miR-21 for the chondrogenic differentiation of ADSC spheroids. Our results demonstrated that miR-transfected ADSC spheroids exhibited upregulated expression of osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation related gene and protein markers, and enhanced mineralization and cell proliferation compared to spheroids differentiated using a commercially-available differentiation medium. Upon confirmation of the osteogenic and chondrogenic potential of miR-transfected ADSC spheroids, using aspiration-assisted bioprinting, these spheroids were 3D bioprinted into a dual-layer heterotypic osteochondral interface with a stratified arrangement of distinct osteogenic and chondrogenic zones. The proposed approach holds great promise for the biofabrication of stratified tissues, not only for the osteochondral interfaces presented in this work, but also for other composite tissues and tissue interfaces, such as, but not limited to, the bone-tendon-muscle interface and craniofacial tissues. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.","bioprinting; bone; cartilage; miRNA; spheroids; stem cells","Bioprinting; Cell Differentiation; Chondrogenesis; Humans; MicroRNAs; Osteogenesis; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; Bone; Cartilage; Cell proliferation; Histology; Muscle; RNA; microRNA; Mirn140 microRNA, human; Adipose derived stem cells; Bioprinting; Cell spheroids; Chondrogenic; MiRNA; Osteochondral; Osteogenic; Osteogenic differentiation; Spheroid; Stem-cell; bioprinting; bone development; cell differentiation; chondrogenesis; genetics; human; procedures; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; Stem cells","","MicroRNAs, ; Mirn140 microRNA, human, ","","","National Institutes of Health or National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1914885, 2033673); National Science Foundation, NSF; National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIDCR, (R01DE024790, R01DE028614); National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIDCR","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number RDE024790A (DJH), R01DE028614 (ITO), and the National Science Foundation Award Number 2033673 (DJH) and 1914885 (ITO).

The powder features low levels of nano-sized Cu-Ni-Mo; these alloying elements are placed into the concavities of the iron powder. When these powders were used for LPBF printing, the processing window for the volumetric energy density ranged from 93 to 130 J/mm3. However, careful control of laser power (150 – 225 W) and scan speed (500 – 900 mm/s) was essential. In terms of production, a maximum relative density of 99.67% was achieved upon application of an energy density of 108 J/mm3 (175 W, 700 mm/s). An average hardness of 217.1 ± 4.7 HV was obtained, exhibiting stable standard deviations and confirming excellent mechanical homogeneity. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping revealed excellent chemical homogeneity; this translated to good mechanical homogeneity because of the uniform mixing of the nano-sized alloying elements. The printed tensile bars were stable and of a relatively high aspect ratio. Tensile strength measurements revealed that samples prepared using the partially pre-alloyed iron powder were better than those fabricated from simple raw WA iron powder; the former samples exhibited an ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 460.91 MPa with elongation of 6.98% and the latter a UTS of 197.15 MPa with elongation of 0.45%. Therefore, the pre-alloyed WA iron powder developed in this study can successfully be used in LPBF and presents a more cost-effective alternative to traditional gas atomized iron powders. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Laser Powder Bed Fusion; Mechanical properties; Partially pre-alloyed powder, Nano-sized alloying elements, Laser parameter optimization; Water-atomized iron powder","3D printers; Alloying; Aspect ratio; Copper alloys; Cost effectiveness; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Iron alloys; Molybdenum alloys; Nickel alloys; Tensile strength; Laser parameters; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Mechanical; Nano sized; Parameter optimization; Partially pre-alloyed powder, nano-sized alloying element, laser parameter optimization; Powder bed; Prealloyed powder; Water atomized iron powder; Alloying elements","","","","","Fostering Global Talents for Innovative Growth Program, (P0008745); Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology, KIAT; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (2020K2A9A2A06071441, FY2020); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work was supported by the MOTIE (Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy) in Korea, under the Fostering Global Talents for Innovative Growth Program (P0008745) supervised by the Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology ( KIAT ), by the framework of international cooperation program managed by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) (grant no. 2020K2A9A2A06071441 , FY2020) and by Nano·Material Technology Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning.

Recently, PCMs based on superlattice (SL) phase change layers have shown low resistance drift, however the origin of this low drift remains unexplored. Here, we uncover that resistance drift in SL-PCM based on alternating layers of Sb2Te3 and Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) is controlled by the number of SL interfaces as well as the degree of SL intermixing. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal smaller and more stable activation energy upon annealing (thus suppressed structural relaxation) in our SL-PCM vs. control GST devices, accounting for the low resistance drift. By controlling SL interfaces, we achieve low resistance drift coefficient v < 0.01 in these SL-PCMs, maintained after extensive cycling and at various read voltages and intervals - showing robustness required for analog computing with PCM. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","GST; interface; low resistance drift; PCM; Phase change memory; superlattice; temperature","Activation energy; Antimony; Phase change materials; Phase change memory; Tellurium; Tin; Annealing; Electrical resistance measurement; GST; Low resistance; Low resistance drift; Phase-change memory; Resistance; Resistance drifts; Superlattice; Temperature measurement","","","","","","","Raoux S., Xiong F., Wuttig M., Pop E., Phase change materials and phase change memory, MRS Bull., 39, 8, pp. 703-710, (2014); Sebastian A., Gallo M.L., Burr G.W., Kim S., BrightSky M., Eleftheriou E., Tutorial: Brain-inspired computing using phasechange memory devices, J.

Thus, in recent years, an innovative twin-wire-based plasma arc additive manufacturing (TW-PAAM) technique has been developed to fabricate the Ti-48Al alloy with low cost. In this research, the Ti-48Al alloys are fabricated by the TW-PAAM and the tungsten inert gas welding-based wire and arc additive manufacturing (TIG-WAAM). Afterward, the microstructure, residual stress and fatigue properties are characterized subsequently. The microstructure of the TiAl alloy was found to consist of a dendritic grain region and a fully lamellar colony region. The fully lamellar colonies composed of α2 and γ phases, and the size of the lamellar colonies tends to increase from the upper to the lower. The residual stress value in the TiAl alloy of lower part is higher than the upper part. Additionally, the mean residual stress value of TW-PAAM TiAl alloy (57.6 MPa) is lower than the TIG-WAAM TiAl alloy(68.4 MPa), decreasing by 15.7%. And the fatigue strength of TiAl alloy in the lower part shows poor fatigue properties compared to the upper part, which is mainly attribute to the effect of residual stress and the size of lamellar colonies. © 2022, ASM International.","fatigue crack propagation; microstructure; residual stress; titanium aluminide; WAAM","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Fatigue crack propagation; Industrial research; Inert gas welding; Inert gases; Microstructure; Residual stresses; Titanium alloys; Fatigue cracks propagation; Fatigue properties; Fully lamellar; Plasma arc; Stress values; Ti-48Al alloy; TiAl alloy; Titanium aluminides; Tungsten inert gas welding; WAAM; Wire","","","","","Shanghai Science and Technology Committee Innovation, (19511106400, 19511106402); State Key Laboratory of Metal Material for Marine Equipment and Application, (SKLMEA-K201906); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52075317); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; State Key Laboratory of Metal Material for Marine Equipment and Application","Funding text 1: This research was supported by Shanghai Science and Technology Committee Innovation Grants (nos. 19511106400 and 19511106402), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 52075317), and the State Key Laboratory of Metal Material for Marine Equipment and Application (no.

We use long term evolution/5G based spectrum access system (SAS) in the wireless network and the optical network is comprised of an Ethernet Passive Optical Network (EPON). The proposal targets a learning-based intelligent SAS where opportunistic allocation of any available bandwidth is done after meeting the SLA requirements. Such an opportunistic allocation is particularly beneficial for nomadic users with varying QoS requirements. The opportunistic allocation is carried out with the help of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction. The proposal allows the users of the integrated network to decide the payment they want to make in order to opportunistically avail bandwidth. Learning automata is used for the users to intelligently converge to the optimal payment value based on the network load. The payment made by the users is later used by the optical network units of the EPON to prepare the bids for the auction. The proposal has been verified through extensive simulations.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.","EPON; learning automata; LTE; service level agreement; VCG auction; wireless optical integrated networks","Bandwidth; Ethernet; Frequency allocation; IEEE Standards; III-V semiconductors; Optical communication; Passive optical networks; Quality of service; Spectroscopy; Ethernet passive optical networks]; IEEE 802.3 standard; Integrated networks; Learning Automata; LTE; Optical network units; Proposal; Servicelevel agreement (SLA); Vickrey-clarke-groves auctions; Wireless communications; Wireless optical integrated network; Wireless-optical; Long Term Evolution (LTE)","","","","","","","Mueck M.D., Srikanteswara S., Badic B., Spectrum sharing: Licensed shared access (LSA) and spectrum access system (SAS), pp. 1-26, (2015); Sohul M.M., Yao M., Yang T., Reed J.H., Spectrum access system for the citizen broadband radio service, IEEE Commun.

The as-printed (AP) sample initially consists of a dual-phase microstructure, with 78% martensite and 22% retained austenite. Then, the combined HIP and H1025 applied to the AP sample resulted in lower retained austenite of 7%. The microstructural analysis indicates that the post-processing after printing alleviated the process-induced defects reducing the overall defect content from 0.37% to 0.01%. Moreover, it is observed that the characteristic melt pools are dissolved, resulting in a homogeneous microstructure with reduced grain sizes. A room-temperature compression testing was then applied to the sample before and after post-processing treatment. It has been identified that, in both samples, the retained austenite transforms into martensite, a characteristic of the transformation-induced plasticity effect. The critical stress to initiate the dynamic transformation was then determined to be lower in the HIP sample than that of the AP sample. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the combined HIP+H1025 processing employed in this work effectively increased the mechanical properties of LPBF-fabricated 17–4PH steel. © 2022","17–4PH; Additive manufacturing; Hot isostatic pressing; LPBF","Additives; Austenite; Compression testing; Defects; Hot isostatic pressing; Martensite; Microstructure; Sintering; 17–4PH; Hot-isostatic pressings; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Micro-structural properties; Micromechanical property; Post-processing; Powder bed; Printed samples; Retained austenite; 3D printers","","","","","; Canada Foundation for Innovation, CFI; McCain Foundation; New Brunswick Innovation Foundation, NBIF","The authors acknowledge the funding received from a McCain Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI), and the New Brunswick Innovation Foundation (NBIF).","Najmon J.C., Raeisi S., Tovar A., Review of additive manufacturing technologies and applications in the aerospace industry, Additive Manufacturing for the Aerospace Industry, (2019); Tofail S.A.M., Koumoulos E.P., Bandyopadhyay A., Bose S., O'Donoghue L., Charitidis C., Additive manufacturing: scientific and technological challenges, market uptake and opportunities, Mater.

Manually detecting skin lesions (SL) from dermoscopy images is a difficult and time-consuming process. Thus, researchers designed computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems to assist dermatologists in the early detection of skin cancer. Moreover, SL detection naturally exhibits a long-tailed distribution due to the complex patient-level conditions and the existence of rare diseases. Very limited research for handling this issue exists on SL detection. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end decoupled training for the long-tailed skin lesion classification task. Specifically, we initialized the training of a network with a novel loss function (Formula presented.) able to guide the model to a better representation of the features. Then, we fine-tuned the pretrained networks with a weighted variant of (Formula presented.) helping to improve the robustness of the network to class imbalance. We evaluated our model on the ISIC 2018 public dataset against existing methods for handling class imbalance and existing approaches for SL detection. The results demonstrated the superiority of our framework, outperforming all compared methods by a minimum margin of 2% with a single model. © 2022 by the authors.","computer-aided diagnosis; deep learning; long-tailed distribution; skin lesion detection","","","","","","Grand Équipement National De Calcul Intensif, GENCI; , (ANR-20-CE45-0026); ","This research was funded by the French National Research Agency through the DIAMELEX project (https://anr.fr/Projet-ANR-20-CE45-0026, accessed on 7 October 2022).

Serum is a complex sample matrix that contains a variety of proteins, and a matrix is used in many clinical tests. In this study, the device performance was tested using commercial serum samples from healthy donors spiked with the following target proteins: cellular fibronectin (c-Fn) and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9). The microfluidic molds were fabricated using micro milling on acrylic and using stereolithography (SLA) three-dimensional (3D) printing for an alternative method and comparison. A simple quality control was performed for both fabrication mold methods to inspect the channel height of the chip that plays a critical role in the labeling process. The fabricated microfluidic chip shows a good reproducibility and repeatability of the performance for the optimized channel height of 150 µm. The spiked proteins of c-Fn and MMP9 in the human serum-based matrix, were successfully labeled by the functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). The biomarker labeling occurring in the serum was compared using a simple matrix sample: phosphate buffer. The measured signals obtained by using a magnetoresistive (MR) biochip platform showed that the labeling using the proposed microfluidic chip is in good agreement for both matrixes, i.e., the analytical performance (sensitivity) obtained with the serum, near the relevant cutoff values, is within the uncertainty of the measurements obtained with a simple and more controlled matrix: phosphate buffer. This finding is promising for stroke patient stratification where these biomarkers are found at high concentrations in the serum. © 2022 by the authors.","biosensor; cellular fibronectin; magnetic nanoparticle; magnetoresistive; microfluidic chip; MMP9; serum","3D printers; Biochips; Biomarkers; Microfluidics; Milling (machining); Molds; Nanomagnetics; Proteins; Quality control; Uncertainty analysis; Cellular fibronectin; Cellulars; Human serum; Labelings; Magnetoresistive; matrix; Matrix metallopeptidase 9; Metallopeptidases; Microfluidic-chips; Serum; Microfluidic chips","","","","","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (PTDC/MEC-URG/29561/2017)","This work was supported by FCT funding through the project FIM4Stroke (reference PTDC/MEC-URG/29561/2017).","Chou Y.N., Sun F., Hung H.C., Jain P., Sinclair A., Zhang P., Bai T., Chang Y., Wen T.C., Yu Q., Et al., Ultra-low fouling and high antibody loading zwitterionic hydrogel coatings for sensing and detection in complex media, Acta Biomater, 40, pp. 31-37, (2016); Warkiani M.E., Khoo B.L., Wu L., Tay A.K.P., Bhagat A.A.S., Han J., Lim C.T., Ultra-fast, label-free isolation of circulating tumor cells from blood using spiral microfluidics, Nat.

Therefore, many companies are trying to produce products by introducing 3D printing technology into the manufacturing process. The 3D printing process is based on additive manufacturing (AM), which can fabricate complex shapes and reduce material waste and production time. Although AM has many advantages, its product quality is poor compared to conventional manufacturing systems. This study proposes a methodology to improve the quality of AM products based on data analysis. The targeted quality of AM is the surface roughness of the stacked wall. Surface roughness is one of the important quality indicators and can cause short product life and poor structure performance. To control the surface roughness, the resultant surface roughness needs to be predicted in advance depending on the process parameters. Various analysis methods such as data pre-processing and deep neural networks (DNN) combined with sensor data are used to predict surface roughness in the proposed methodology. The proposed methodology is applied to field data from operated wire + arc additive manufacturing (WAAM), and the analysis result shows its effectiveness, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.93%. © 2022 by the authors.","arc welding; deep neural network; surface roughness; wire + arc additive manufacturing","Metals; Neural Networks, Computer; Printing, Three-Dimensional; 3D printers; Additives; Data handling; Deep neural networks; Electric arc welding; Quality control; metal; 3-D printing; 3D printing process; 3D-printing; Arc-welding; Batch production; Manufacturing industries; Manufacturing process; Printing technologies; Wire + arc additive manufacturing; Wire arc; three dimensional printing; Surface roughness","","Metals, ","","","Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion, IITP; Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation; National Science Foundation, NSF, (2015693); National Science Foundation, NSF; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2020-0-01539); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP","This research was supported by the Ministry of Science, ICT (MSIT), Korea, under the High-Potential Individuals Global Training Program (No. 2020-0-01539) supervised by the Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP).

Achieving reproducible component quality requires a homogenous powder bed. In this research, a recoater-based line sensor is used to acquire images of the powder bed with 6 µm/pixel resolution under coaxial, darkfield, and diffuse lighting conditions. Strategies for the provocation of various inhomogeneities are derived and used to compile datasets comprising the classes balling, incomplete spreading, groove, ridge, spatters, protruding part, scattered powder, and homogenous. A data pipeline is designed to extract image patches ranging up to 6 × 6 mm2 in size and from 6 µm/pixel to 96 µm/pixel in geometrical resolution. The resulting 45 data sets are used to train convolutional neuronal networks using the Xception architecture pretrained on ImageNet. The highest classification accuracy of 99.15 % is achieved for 6 × 6 mm2 patch size and 6 µm/px using the dark field lighting. Seven classes are classified with F1-scores between 97.85 % and 99.71 %. A gradual improvement of the geometrical resolution from 96 µm/pixel to 6 µm/pixel increases the classification performance while requiring smaller patches. This demonstrates the advantage of imaging systems with increased resolution compared to presently utilized camera systems. © 2022","Deep learning; Image processing; Laser Powder Bed Fusion; Machine learning; Powder bed; Process monitoring; Quality control; Transfer learning","3D printers; Additives; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Image processing; Learning systems; Neurons; Dark-field; Deep learning; Geometrical resolution; Images processing; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Machine-learning; Powder bed; Transfer learning; Process monitoring","","","","","","","Wohlers T., Campbell R.I., Diegel O., Kowen J., Mostow N., Wohlers Report 2021: 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Global State of the Industry, (2021); Shamsdini S., Ghoncheh M.H., Mohammadi M., Effect of recoater-blade type on the mechanical properties and microstructure of additively manufactured maraging steels, Mater.

However, one of the key technical difficulties lies in the poor L-PBF process performance of Mg, contributed by the high susceptibility to oxidation, vaporization, thermal expansion, and powder attachment etc. This work investigated the influence of L-PBF energy input and scanning strategy on the formation quality of porous scaffolds by using WE43 powder, and characterized the microstructure, mechanical properties, biocompatibility, biodegradation and osteogenic effect of the as-built WE43 porous scaffolds. With the customized energy input and scanning strategy, the relative density of struts reached over 99.5%, and the geometrical error between the designed and the fabricated porosity declined to below 10%. Massive secondary phases including intermetallic precipitates and oxides were observed. The compressive strength (4.37–23.49 MPa) and elastic modulus (154.40–873.02 MPa) were comparable to those of cancellous bone. Good biocompatibility was observed by in vitro cell viability and in vivo implantation. The biodegradation of as-built porous scaffolds promoted the osteogenic effect, but the structural integrity devastated after 12 h by the immersion tests in Hank's solution and after 4 weeks by the implantation in rabbits' femur, indicating an excessively rapid degradation rate. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Biodegradable metal; Laser powder bed fusion; Magnesium alloy; Porous scaffold; WE43","alloy; magnesium; molecular scaffold; Article; biocompatibility; biodegradability; biodegradation; bone development; cell viability; corrosion; mesenchymal stem cell; micro-computed tomography; nonhuman; orthopedics; porosity; powder bed fusion; staining; transmission electron microscopy","","magnesium, 7439-95-4","","","AO Foundation, AO, (AOTAP21-47); AO Foundation, AO; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51875310, 52175274, 82172065); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFE0104200); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2018YFE0104200 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51875310 , 52175274 , 82172065 ) and AO Foundation ( AOTAP21-47 ).

Extreme outsourcing of key capabilities has created complex and deep hybrid organizations between armed forces and the private sector. In this study, the internal and external effects and requirements of Additive Manufacturing in the context of the hybrid organization of The Finnish Defence Forces (FDF) and its strategic partner in Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul (MRO), and Millog Oy were studied. First, with a literature review, we sought to link the capability development processes and the change drivers within them in both military and commercial contexts. Then, we utilized an existing, structured capability model used by the FDF (DOTMLPFI) and its individual change drivers to form an initial concept of AM as a part of the hybrid organization in question. The initial concept shows that AM can increase the performance of the commercially backed Military Logistic System by mitigating the risks of spare parts shortage in case of supply line disturbances and by facilitating localized spare parts production. However, the different primary goals of the military and commercial organizations and the contractual base of the hybrid organization impose constraints on the capability development process. Administrative decision-making across the organizations and the conflict between maximizing military and commercial potential are the key challenges in maintaining joint-capability systems of hybrid organizations. © 2022, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; Capability development; Change driver; Military logistics","","","","","","Aalto-Yliopisto; Sähkötekniikan Korkeakoulu, Aalto-yliopisto; Insinööritieteiden Korkeakoulu, Aalto-yliopisto","Open Access funding provided by Aalto University.

The objective of this research is to optimize FDM parameters in order to obtain the highest stiffness. In this context, we used Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and we made experimental tests to validate its results. The experimental tests are divided into two categories, gears with the same parameters and gears with the same layer height and variable filling percentage. The average results of gear stiffness with the same parameters are 8.18% highest than the average results of gear stiffness with the same layer height and variable filling percentages. © 2022, Dr D.

However, in the design of mechanical metallic structures, gaining such behavior without using special materials or external sources is still a visionary thought. Here the concept of lifelike metallic structures is introduced. The vision is to produce designs where the metallic walls can behave like human muscles. To create such structures, origami-inspired designs in combination with compliant mechanisms are proposed. For fabricating such designs with desired mechanical properties, it is also proposed to leverage additive manufacturing techniques. © 2022 Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME)","Additive manufacturing; Compliant mechanisms; Lifelike metallic structure; Origami-inspired","Additives; Compliant mechanisms; Mechanisms; Metals; External sources; Human muscles; Lifelike metallic structure; Manufacturing techniques; Material sources; Mechanical; Metallic structures; Metallic walls; Origami-inspired; 3D printers","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CMMI–1840276, CMMI–1937865); National Science Foundation, NSF; Office of Naval Research, ONR, (N00014-18-1-2794); Office of Naval Research, ONR; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Fossil Energy, FE, (DE-AC05-00OR22725); Office of Fossil Energy, FE; U.S. Navy, USN","Funding text 1: Authors also acknowledges partial support from the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Fossil Energy, under contract DE-AC05-00OR22725 with UT-Battelle, LLC.

The remarkable efficiency of these biological materials is the result of billions of years of evolution. In this study, bioinspired design of architectured materials based on principles of edge-to-edge tessellation is additively manufactured. The tessellations are inspired by the atomic arrangements in cubic metallic crystal structures; simple cubic (SC), body-centered cubic (BCC), and face-centered cubic (FCC). The unit cells in these tessellations were evolved from the basic spherical morphology along with necessary surfaces at the joining area to achieve edge-to-edge tessellations. The biomimetic architectured materials called ‘advanced functional architectured materials (AFAMs)’ are designed and printed with HP-MJF 4200 powder bed fusion technology. The structural and functional properties of each AFAM were evaluated experimentally and numerically under uniaxial compression testing. The result showed FCC AFAM has high peak strength, elastic modulus, and energy absorption compared to other benchmarked surface and truss-based lattice structures. In contrast, SC AFAM demonstrated high deformation (ductility) before densification. The study also reveals that each AFAM behaves uniquely, almost as different material, in terms of its load-bearing and deformation abilities. All the AFAMs can be interlocked without any interface issues to achieve multi-material properties which otherwise cannot be achieved with functionally graded structure. The combination of these AFAMs can be utilized as an efficient solution for achieving a complex set of multi-functional requirements in additively manufactured products. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Advanced functional architectured materials (AFAMs); Biomimetic; Edge-to-edge tessellation; Interface strength; Tessellation principles","Atomic force microscopy; Biology; Biomimetic materials; Biomimetics; Compression testing; Crystal atomic structure; Deformation; Interfaces (materials); Morphology; Advanced functional architectured material; Architectured materials; Edge-to-edge; Edge-to-edge tessellation; Face-centred cubic; Interface strength; Interlockings; Property; Simple cubic; Tessellation principle; Biological materials","","","","","Ministry of Education, MOE, (108PO12)","This research work is financially supported by the High Speed 3D Printing Research Center from the Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of theHigher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE) (grant number 108PO12 ) in Taiwan.

In the current study, a 308L stainless steel (SS) cylindrical component was manufactured by WAAM technique using gas metal arc welding (GMAW) process. The mechanical and microstructural characteristics of the deposited WAAM 308L SS cylinder were investigated. The microhardness of the WAAM SS cylinder varied slightly along the building direction. The lower zone of the cylinder showed higher hardness than the middle and upper zones. The tensile strength (TS), yield strength (YS) and elongation (EL) of the WAAM 308L cylinder are 331-356 MPa, 535-582 MPa, and 44-51% in the longitudinal, transverse and diagonal orientations, respectively. The microstructure of the WAAM SS cylinder is characterized by austenite dendrites that grow vertically and residual ferrite that exists within the austenite matrix. The results show that the properties of 308L SS cylinder produced by the GMAW-WAAM technique is matching with wrought 308L SS alloy (YS: 360-480 MPa, UTS: 530-650 MPa and EL: 35-45%). Therefore, the GMAW-WAAM 308L SS technique is found to be suitable for industrial use to manufacture stainless steel components. © 2022 Carl Hanser Verlag.

This study aims to evaluate the biological effects of graphene oxide (GO) on turned and sandblasted, large-grit, and acid-etched (SLA) titanium surfaces. In vitro, bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) are seeded onto titanium discs, whose surfaces have been treated in four different ways (SLA and/or GO), to observe its effects on cellular responses such as adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. In vivo, a rabbit tibia model is used to observe the effects of the four surface treatments on osseointegration of screw-shaped titanium implants. The bone-to-implant contact is analyzed using light microscopic histomorphometry. GO significantly promotes the viability, proliferation and osteoblast differentiation of BMSCs, and it enhances the attachment and proliferation of HGFs. SLA and GO treatment of implant surfaces results in significant improvement of osseointegration in vivo. Physicochemical modification of the titanium surface by SLA treatment and GO coating stimulates osteogenic activities of mesenchymal stem cells and improves biocompatibility to connective tissue cells, leading to enhancement of bone healing at the bone-implant interface. © 2022 The Authors.

Thus, the residual stress state determination is essential for understanding the part's limitations. One residual stress measurement technique applicable to PBF-LB/M parts is the slitting method. This destructive technique allows through-thickness measurements and copes well with discontinuities in the material, yet is limited to one-dimensional stress profiles. Conversely, other stress measurement techniques, e.g. X-ray diffraction, are restricted to the part's surface. This article presents an inexpensive and straightforward stress determination approach that combines an implementation of the slitting method with X-ray diffraction measurements to create a continuous two-dimensional residual stress map along a part's cross-section. The approach was numerically validated using finite element models that simulate, on the one hand, the PBF-LB/M process and, on the other hand, the measuring process; further, it was experimentally tested in PBF-LB/M AlSi10Mg samples. The use of linear elastic fracture mechanics allowed a straightforward formulation of the approach, which enabled a high degree of automation. The accurate stress distribution results and the correlation with the simulations and previous studies demonstrate the approach's robustness and effectiveness for complex residual stress states determination in two dimensions. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; AlSi10Mg; Laser powder bed fusion; Residual stress; Slitting method; XRD","3D printers; Fracture mechanics; Powder metals; Stress concentration; Stress measurement; Thickness measurement; X ray diffraction; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Laser-based; Measurement techniques; Metallics; Powder bed; Residual stress state; Residual stresses distributions; Slitting method; XRD; Residual stresses","","","","","German Federal Ministry of Defense; Universität der Bundeswehr München","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the German Federal Ministry of Defense and Universität der Bundeswehr München.

Primary data was collected from 190 samples in India and the PLS-SEM technique was then used to perform data analysis. The findings indicate that big data analytics and additive manufacturing can aid in risk control and in turn improve the SC resilience of a firm and further minimize the propagation of the supply chain ripple effect in case of disruption. This study sheds light on firms’ 4IR resources (BDA and AM) that can be useful in developing risk control capabilities to deal with disruptions in supply chains. BDA, in particular, impacts risk intelligence, whereas AM impacts both preparedness and intelligence risk control. Distinguishing between BDA and AM is therefore important when firms are considering which technology to adopt. Therefore, for the sample analyzed, BDA has a prominent role in building risk control and resilience capabilities. These findings are an important contribution to SC risk management theory and this study also creates new research opportunities. Firms need to adopt collaborative planning, forecasting, smart manufacturing, and replenishments initiatives for vulnerable supply chain activities to reduce the SC ripple effect. Lastly, flexible, real-time production helps reduce the SC ripple effect. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive Manufacturing; Big Data Analytics; Risk Control; Supply Chain Resilience; Supply Chain Ripple Effect","3D printers; Additives; Big data; Data Analytics; Risk management; Big data analytic; Contingent resources; Data analytics; Empirical studies; Resources based; Ripple effects; Risks controls; Supply chain resiliences; Supply chain ripple effect; Supply-chain risks; Supply chains","","","","","","","Afshari H., Jaber M.Y., Searcy C., Investigating the effects of learning and forgetting on the feasibility of adopting additive manufacturing in supply chains, Computers & Industrial Engineering, 128, pp. 576-590, (2019); Aggour K.S., Kumar V.S., Cuddihy P., Williams J.W., Gupta V., Dial L., Vinciquerra J., December).

The acoustic resonance measurements are tested against an experimental database that covers a broad range of process parameters and large variations of the standard volumetric energy density. Two other nondestructive techniques are used to assess the potential of the RUS measurements of additively manufactured samples: the easy-to-use Archimedes density measurement and the cost-intensive computerized X-ray tomography. Our results show that RUS provides both qualitative and quantitative insights that allow the detection of the amount of lack of fusion porosities and the estimation of the elastic properties of the fabricated samples. Quantitative correlations between the three nondestructive testing methods are obtained, hinting at how RUS could be used effectively for systematic post-production testing of LPBF samples. © 2022 The Authors","Laser powder bed fusion; Nondestructive testing, Archimedes density measurement; Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy; X-ray computed tomography","Additives; Computerized tomography; Density measurement (specific gravity); Spectroscopy; Ultrasonic applications; Acoustic resonance; Innovative techniques; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Non-destructive analysis; Nondestructive characterization; Nondestructive testing, archimede density measurement; Powder bed; Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy; X-ray computed tomography; Nondestructive examination","","","","","","","Spierings A.B., Schneider M., Eggenberger R., Comparison of density measurement techniques for additive manufactured metallic parts, Rapid Prototyp.

The combination of high pressure and small needle diameter exposes cells to considerable shear stress, which can lead to cell damage and death. Approaches to monitor and control shear stress-induced cell damage are currently not well established. To visualize the effects of printing-induced shear stress on plasma membrane integrity, we add FM 1-43 to the bioink, a styryl dye that becomes fluorescent when bound to lipid membranes, such as the cellular plasma membrane. Upon plasma membrane disruption, the dye enters the cell and also stains intracellular membranes. Extrusion of alginate-suspended NIH/3T3 cells through a 200 µm printing needle led to an increased FM 1-43 incorporation at high pressure, demonstrating that typical shear stresses during bioprinting can transiently damage the plasma membrane. Cell imaging in a microfluidic channel confirmed that FM 1-43 incorporation is caused by cell strain. Notably, high printing pressure also impaired cell survival in bioprinting experiments. Using cell types of different stiffnesses, we find that shear stress-induced cell strain, FM 1-43 incorporation and cell death were reduced in stiffer compared to softer cell types and demonstrate that cell damage and death correlate with shear stress-induced cell deformation. Importantly, supplementation of the suspension medium with physiological concentrations of CaCl2 greatly reduced shear stress-induced cell damage and death but not cell deformation. As the sudden influx of calcium ions is known to induce rapid cellular vesicle exocytosis and subsequent actin polymerization in the cell cortex, we hypothesize that calcium supplementation facilitates the rapid resealing of plasma membrane damage sites. We recommend that bioinks should be routinely supplemented with physiological concentrations of calcium ions to reduce shear stress-induced cell damage and death during extrusion bioprinting. © 2022 The Author(s).

Components produced by AM processes are built spot to spot and layer by layer and that leads to varying local heat absorption and distribution, resulting in varying local properties depending on the shape complexity and build parameters. Different properties in different directions and at various component locations can be expected. Since AM parts are often sub-scale and/or with topological complexity, mechanical characterization with the use of standard specimens is not typically possible and small-sized specimen techniques have to be developed and applied. In the current paper, three AM produced parts made of Ti-6Al-4V by Electron Beam Powder Bed Fusion (EB-PBF) technology have been investigated. Three material conditions are reported here: as-deposited, stress relieved and HIP-ed. Local mechanical properties are assessed with the use of miniaturized compact tension (MCT) fracture toughness specimens and miniaturized tensile tests (MTT). The results are complemented by microstructural and fractographic analysis and are discussed in the light of literature values. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Fracture toughness; Local properties; Miniature tension and fracture toughness specimens","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Electron beams; Tensile testing; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Additive technology; Electron-beam; Local fractures; Local property; Metallic part; Miniature tension and fracture toughness specimen; Post-processing; Powder bed; Property characterizations; Toughness properties; Fracture toughness","","","","","ASTM; Additive Technologies, (2018-2022); CWRU Distinguished University; MSM/EF; Ministerstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy, MŠMT; Ministerstvo Průmyslu a Obchodu, MPO","The paper was supported by the project EF17_048/0007350 - Pre-Application Research of Functionally Graduated Materials by Additive Technologies (2018-2022, MSM/EF), The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic and by the institutional funding of the research organization decision no. 3/2018 of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic.

Traditionally, the objective function in topology optimization for design of structures is to minimize the strain energy (SE). For synthesis of compliant mechanisms, the objective function is usually to maximize the mutual potential energy (MPE). To design an adaptive compliant gripper for grasping size-varied objects, a multicriteria objective function considering both the SE and MPE at two different output ports is proposed in this study. In addition, based on the fact that different infill densities in three-dimensional (3D) printing leads to prototypes with different equivalent mechanical properties, this article proposes that a multimaterial design can be approximated by varying the values of infill densities in different portions of a 3D-printed component, which enables the multimaterial designs to be prototyped using the general low-cost, single-material fused deposition modeling 3D printing machines. The proposed method is used to design and prototype a bi-material compliant finger which is 3D printed using a flexible thermoplastic elastomer with infill densities of 30% and 100%. The experimental results demonstrate that the bi-material finger is a better design in terms of reducing the driving force while increasing the output displacement at the fingertip comparing to the single-material finger design with the same volume and weight. Furthermore, a two-finger gripper with two identical multimaterial-like compliant fingers is prototyped and installed on a six-axis industrial robot. The experimental tests are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented design.  © 2022 Chih-Hsing Liu et al.

In-situ temperature measurement by a high-speed thermographic camera and part-scale thermal analysis by the finite element method revealed that the constricted geometry suppressed thermal diffusion in the building sample, thereby increasing the sample temperature to over 1000 °C and maintaining the temperature at 700–1000 °C throughout the LPBF process. Multi-track thermal analyses also revealed that both the temperature gradient and solidification rate decreased by more than one digit, leading to a three-digit decrease in the cooling rate. Compared to the parts with the usual thermal history, the parts built at such high temperature had larger crystal grains elongated along the building direction, thicker cellular structures, more carbide precipitates, and a reduction of microhardness. From these results, a solidification map was created based on the correlations between the temperature gradient and solidification rate and the microstructures, and the effects of the elevated temperature on the epitaxial grain growth were also discussed. Consequently, it was demonstrated that the solidification behaviors could be controlled directly during the LPBF process without any additional heating mechanism. © 2022 The Authors","Constricted sample geometry; Elevated temperature; Grain growth; Hastelloy X; Laser powder bed fusion; Solidification behavior","Carbides; Geometry; Solidification; Temperature measurement; Thermal gradients; Thermoanalysis; Constricted sample geometry; Elevated temperature; Fusion process; Hastelloy X; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; Sample geometry; Sample temperature; Solidification behaviors; Grain growth","","","","","Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program; Swine Innovation Porc, SIP; Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST; Council for Science, Technology and Innovation, CSTI","Financial support from the Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (CSTI), the Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP) “Materials Integration for Revolutionary Design System of Structural Materials” (funding agency: JST) is acknowledged.

Furthermore, part properties such as mechanical properties, surface roughness, or density exhibit a comparatively low reproducibility. Recent progress in the field of process monitoring, however, indicates that infrared thermography can be used to correlate melt pool temperatures with the resulting part properties. The analysis of the influence of process parameters on the resulting melt pool temperatures has up until now been limited to the evaluation of the maximum temperature during exposure and the mean temperature at arbitrary moments after exposure. However, the cooling rate of the polymer melt is also essential. To prove this hypothesis, a continuous data stream, which enables an automated calculation of characteristic processing times and temperatures, is introduced within the scope of this work. Single-layer specimens are manufactured with various energy inputs, while the resulting temperature of the melt is recorded using thermal imaging. The peak temperatures are combined with the characteristics that describe the temperature decay after exposure, such as a decay time determined at a specific cooling rate. These metrics quantify the cooling behavior of melt pools in a systematic and reproducible way. Furthermore, the sequence of decay values at different cooling rates can potentially be combined with existing process knowledge to differentiate process regimes. The presented approach can be used to create a more in-depth process understanding in later works, thereby enabling applications such as in-situ quality assurance. © 2022, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; Infrared thermography; Laser sintering; Laser-based powder bed fusion of plastics; Material qualification; Polyamide 12","Additives; Density (specific gravity); Laser heating; Melting; Polymer melts; Process control; Process monitoring; Quality assurance; Selective laser melting; Sintering; Surface roughness; Cooling rates; Laser sintering; Laser-based; Laser-based powder bed fusion of plastic; Material qualification; Melt pool temperature; Poly-amide 12; Powder bed; Property; Thermal-imaging; Thermography (imaging)","","","","","Technische Universität München, TUM","","Kusoglu I.M., Donate-Buendia C., Barcikowski S., Et al., Laser powder bed fusion of polymers: quantitative research direction indices, Materials (Basel), 14, (2021); Rietzel D., Werkstoffverhalten und Prozessanalyse beim Laser-Sintern von Thermoplasten.

This promising AM route, however, comes with a dilemma: in the fusion and heat affected zones after e-beam or laser induced melting, one needs a solutionizing annealing to relieve the residual stresses and homogenize the chemical/microstructure. The super-solvus solutionizing temperature is usually adopted from the protocol for the cast superalloys, which almost always causes recrystallization and stray grain growth, resulting in a polycrystalline microstructure and degrading the high-temperature mechanical performance. Here we demonstrate a custom-designed post-printing heat treatment to replace the conventional super-solvus one. The recovery and relatively low temperature diminish the driving force for recrystallization and the movement of stray grain boundaries, without suffocating the chemical/microstructural homogenization thanks to the narrow dendrite width and short element segregation distance. The optimal duration of the heat treatment is proposed to achieve atomic-diffusion mediated chemical homogenization while limiting γ′-particle coarsening in the interdendritic regions. Our strategy makes it practically feasible to resolve several bottleneck problems with one processing/treatment, removing a seemingly formidable obstacle to effective additive manufacturing of superalloy single crystal products. © 2022 The Authors","Chemical homogenization; Heat treatment; Ni-based superalloy single crystals; Recovery; Recrystallization; Stray grain growth","3D printers; Additives; Coarsening; Grain boundaries; Grain growth; Heat affected zone; Nickel alloys; Single crystals; Superalloys; Temperature; Turbomachine blades; Chemical homogenization; Ni-based superalloy single crystal; Ni-based superalloys; Recrystallisation; Single crystal Ni-based superalloys; Single crystal superalloys; Solutionizing; Stray grain growth; Stray grains; Superalloy single crystals; Recrystallization (metallurgy)","","","","","111 Project 2.0, (BP0618008); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-AC02-05CH11231); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; Basic Energy Sciences, BES; Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering, DMSE; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51927801, U2032205); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Xi’an Jiaotong University, XJTU; International Joint Laboratory for MicroNano Manufacturing and Measurement Technologies, IJL-MMMT; National Major Science and Technology Projects of China, (2019-VII-0019-0161); National Major Science and Technology Projects of China","Funding text 1: This work is supported by the National Science and Technology Major Project (2019-VII-0019-0161), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51927801, U2032205 ), and 111 Project 2.0 (BP0618008).

Important issues of cell structure changes, precipitation sequence, and austenite reversion were evaluated. The dominant strengthening factor in each state was elucidated based on yield strength modeling. The as built fully martensitic matrix consists of dislocation cell structures, and its yield strength comes from the martensite lath and solid solution strengthening with comparable contributions. Aged at 440 °C, the cell walls kept stable and massive ω particles prominently strengthened matrix by shearing mechanism. At 490 °C, the cell walls were partially destroyed and austenite reversion just began along the lath boundary. Densely distributed η-Ni3Ti particles produced the peak strength dominantly by the Orowan mechanism, but the shearing process may also exist meanwhile. At 540 °C, cell walls further degraded and reverted austenite formed along the lath boundaries and around some retained cell walls. Its strength decreased mildly mainly due to the wider inter-particle spacing, but was still maintained quite high by Laves-Fe2Mo and η-Ni3Ti particles via the Orowan process. The reverted austenite with limited fraction had a minor role in its strength decrease, but improved ductility significantly. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Maraging steel; Precipitation; Strengthening","Austenite; Cells; Cytology; Maraging steel; Microstructure; Shearing; Strengthening (metal); Walls (structural partitions); Yield stress; Aging temperatures; Austenite reversion; Cell walls; Effect of ageing; Laser powders; Lath boundary; Microstructure evolutions; Powder bed; Reverted austenite; Strengthening; 3D printers","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (U1964204); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work is financed by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. U1964204 ).

Also, they are extensively used in heat exchangers because of their rapid heat transfer rate. This work presents the effects of thin-wall thickness on the microstructures, property, and anisotropy of the laser-powder bed fusion processed thin-walled structures with varied wall thicknesses of 0.3 mm, 0.5 mm, 1.0 mm, and 1.5 mm. The epitaxial columnar growth is favored, and the columnar grain aspect ratio increases with the wall thickness. Further, the columnar grain size increases and the geometrically necessary dislocation density decreases with increasing thickness. These microstructural differences significantly affected the tensile properties; the yield and the tensile strengths reduced, and the elongation increased with the wall thickness increase. Further, the L-PBF processed thin walls presented anisotropic properties. The samples tested along the build direction showed lower strength than those across the build direction. Moreover, the drop in strength with increasing thickness is less in the samples taken across the build direction than that along the build direction. Importantly, the degree of anisotropy increased with increasing wall thickness. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","","Anisotropy; Aspect ratio; Austenitic stainless steel; Heat exchangers; Heat transfer; Microstructure; Tensile strength; 316 L stainless steel; Build direction; Laser powders; Lightweighting; Mechanical anisotropy; Microstructure mechanical properties; Powder bed; Thickness effect; Thin-wall structures; Wall thickness; Thin walled structures","","","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2021R1A2C3006662); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (2019H1D3A1A01102866, 2021H1D3A2A02082660); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (2021R1A2C3006662).

Given the large design freedom provided by LPBF, various shell lattice structures have been designed and fabricated successfully. However, few works focus on predicting and minimizing the discrepancy between as-designed and as-printed structures, which is crucial for the geometric fidelity and resulting structural performance. This is partially due to the complexity of structures with thin-walled features and continuously changing overhang angles. This paper proposed a new method and workflow to predict the printing deviation and conduct the compensation for the thin-walled shell lattice structures fabricated by the high-precision LPBF (hp-LPBF). Numerical simulation, which was used to capture dynamic interaction behavior between the rake, powder particles, and samples, was performed using the discrete element method (DEM) to identify the key factors affecting the deviation prediction. Subsequently, a semi-analytical model was proposed to predict the as-printed thicknesses, in which the molten depth-induced staircase effect, compression-induced thickening effect, and scrape-induced thinning effect were considered. Both inclination angles and wall thickness were observed to have significant influences on the roughness and dimensional accuracy, of which three types of deviation were determined: (1) non-compensable deviation; (2) large but compensable deviation; (3) negligible deviation under 5 %. Experimental results show that, by pre-compensation, the geometric deviation of thin walls with thicknesses of 135 µm and 185 µm was controlled to less than 10 µm. The effectiveness and generality of this method for the thin-walled shell structures were further demonstrated by a case study of Schwarz Primitive triply periodic minimal surface lattice structure, which is characterized by micro-CT using the proposed workflow to predict and modify the lattice thickness and generate the compensated geometry for printing. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Geometric deviation and compensation; High-precision laser powder bed fusion (hp-LPBF); Powder-spreading simulation; Shell lattice structure; Thin-walled structure","Computerized tomography; Fabrication; Finite difference method; Forecasting; Geometry; Numerical methods; Shells (structures); Geometric deviation and compensation; Geometric deviations; High-precision; High-precision laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Lattice structures; Powder bed; Powder-spreading simulation; Shell lattice structure; Thin-walled structures; Thin walled structures","","","","","Chinese University of Hong Kong, CUHK; Shun Hing Institute of Advanced Engineering, SHIAE","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from project # RNE-p2-21 of the Shun Hing Institute of Advanced Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong .","Nagarajan B., Hu Z., Song X., Zhai W., Wei J., Development of micro selective laser melting: the state of the art and future perspectives, Engineering, 5, 4, pp. 702-720, (2019); Fan J., Zhang L., Wei S., Zhang Z., Choi S.-K., Song B., Shi Y., A review of additive manufacturing of metamaterials and developing trends, Mater.

Particularly, innovative structure design and its successful realization are paramount but often challenging due to the vast design space and associated complex manufacturing. Herein, in this study, inspired by pomelo peel's superior shielding protection to the pulp, bionic polyhedron metamaterials (BPMs) that imitate the pomelo peel are designed and realized by metal 3D printing to achieve not only superior heat dissipation but also high energy absorption. Guided by experiments and numerical simulations, the BPM with circular struts possesses the highest Nusselt number, lowest pressure drop, and friction factor at Re = 7000–30000. Above results integrated lead to that the BPM with circular struts exhibit a higher thermal efficiency index that exceeds 1 at 0.92 porosity. Furthermore, the BPM with circular struts possesses moderate specific energy absorption in existing mechanical metamaterials for their corresponding density, which has potential for gas turbines and some cooling structures. The above findings will guide the design of metamaterials with high heat dissipation and energy absorption. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","bionic design; energy absorption; heat dissipation, selective laser melting","Bionics; Geometry; Metamaterials; Selective laser melting; Struts; Automobile applications; Bionic design; Design spaces; Energy absorption capability; Heat dissipation, selective laser melting; High-strength; Innovative structures; Light weight; Selective laser melting; Structure design; Energy absorption","","","","","Academic frontier youth team, (2018QYTD04); Analytical and Testing Center of HUST; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51775208, 51922044); Huazhong University of Science and Technology, HUST; Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2020B090923001)","Funding text 1: This work was sponsored by the Natural and Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51922044, 51775208), the Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province (No. 2020B090923001), the Academic frontier youth team (2018QYTD04) at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST).

This study fundamentally investigated the elemental homogenisation and grain development in the in-situ alloying process of CoCrFeMnNi HEA, by analysing the basic units, i.e., tracks and layers, and introducing Mn as an alloying element to the base CoCrFeNi HEA. Different modelling methods were employed to predict meltpool dimensions, and the results indicated the dependence of the modelling on practical meltpool modes. Delimitation of elemental distribution was found in keyhole meltpools since an intensive flow was generated due to recoil pressure. The homogeneity of in-situ alloyed Mn in single tracks was insufficient whether operated in conduction mode or keyhole mode, which required remelting from adjacent tracks and following layers to promote homogenisation significantly. The preferred orientation in single tracks along scanning directions changed from <001> to <101> as the scanning speed increased, although the cross-sections were similar in size with identical linear energy density. Such preference can be inherited during the printing process and lead to different textures in three-layer samples. It was also observed that applying hatch spacing smaller than a half meltpool width could coarsen the grains in a layer. The results from this study provide structure-parameter correlations for future microstructural tailoring and manipulation. © 2022","Elemental homogenisation; High entropy alloy; In-situ alloying; Laser powder bed fusion; Single track","Alloying elements; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Entropy; High-entropy alloys; Iron alloys; Manganese alloys; Textures; Elemental homogenization; Grain development; High entropy alloys; In-situ alloying; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Meltpool; Microstructural development; Powder bed; Single-tracks; Alloying","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51971108, U19A2085); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, (JCYJ20180504165824643, JSGG20210420091802007); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2019B090907001)","This work was financially supported by the Research and Development Program Project in Key Areas of Guangdong Province (No. 2019B090907001 ), the Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission (Nos.

Even though pre-oxidation of the powders could improve the slurry printability, the residual oxygen element in the material would eventually deteriorate the material purity and performance. In this study, a separated redox route (pre-oxidation, 3D printing and carbothermal reduction) was proposed to overcome these challenges. SiC ceramic powder was pre-oxidized into SiC@SiO2 core-shell form to lower the UV-light absorbance. It was found that the ultraviolet (UV) light absorbance value of SiC powder at 405 nm decreased 20% from 0.357 to 0.284 after pre-oxidation process. The UV-light penetration depth of SiC@SiO2 ceramic slurries at 40 ~ 55 vol% solid loading ranging from 14.81 to 12.82 µm, which surpassed two times that for 40 vol% raw SiC ceramic slurry. Different-shaped structures of SiC@SiO2/resin green ceramic bodies were successfully fabricated by vat photopolymerization 3D printing. The oxygen element resided was then eliminated by carbothermal reduction to avoid detriment of SiO2 to the mechanical performance of the SiC ceramics. Phenolic epoxy acrylate resin with 14 wt% pyrolytic carbon (PyC) yield was chosen as the carbon source and thus the SiC@SiO2/resin green body pyrolyzed into SiC@SiO2/PyC ceramics after 1200 °C. It was found that after the heating temperature was further raised to 1600 °C, most of the pre-introduced SiO2 shells on the surface of SiC particles were in situ transformed into SiC nanowires through carbothermal reduction reaction between SiO2 and PyC, and the content of oxygen element in the ceramic matrix sharply dropped from 20.21% to 2.08%. The results demonstrated that through the proposed redox route, the photopolymerization-related issues including high UV-light absorbance and pre-oxidation-induced impurity for 3D printing of SiC ceramic slurries can be tackled. Finally, high purity porous SiCnw/SiC ceramic components with different structures were produced. This study provides a promising route for the preparation and 3D printing of photopolymerization ceramic slurries using non-oxide ceramics possessing high UV-light absorbance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Carbothermal reduction; Ceramic structure; In-situ transformation; Photopolymerization 3D printing; Silicon carbide","Additives; Carbon; Carbothermal reduction; Ceramic materials; Epoxy resins; Oxidation; Oxygen; Photopolymerization; Powders; Silica; Silicon carbide; Silicon oxides; Sintering; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Ceramic slurry; Ceramics structure; In-situ transformation; Photo polymerization; Photopolymerization 3d printing; Situ transformation; Ultra-violet light; Ultraviolet lights; 3D printers","","","","","Analysis Center of Shenzhen University; Key Project Fund for Science and Technology Development of Guangdong Province, (2020B090924003); Shenzhen Fundamental Research Project , China, (20200731211324001, JCYJ20190808144009478); Shenzhen Fundamental Research Project, China; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51975384); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Huazhong University of Science and Technology, HUST, (P2022–014); Huazhong University of Science and Technology, HUST; State Key Laboratory of Materials Processing and Die and Mould Technology; Shenzhen International Cooperation Research Project, (GJHZ20210705141803011); Shenzhen International Cooperation Research Project; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2020A1515011547); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","Funding text 1: This work is supported by Key Project Fund for Science and Technology Development of Guangdong Province, China (2020B090924003), National Natural Science Foundation of China (51975384), Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation, China (2020A1515011547), Shenzhen Fundamental Research Project, China (JCYJ20190808144009478, 20200731211324001), State Key Laboratory of Materials Processing and Die & Mold Technology, HUST, China (P2022–014) and Shenzhen International Cooperation Research, China (GJHZ20210705141803011).

However, consumer-grade depth cameras currently found in the market are not accurate enough for these tasks where millimeter (mm)-level accuracy is required. This paper presents SL Sensor, a structured light sensing solution capable of producing high fidelity point clouds at 5 Hz by leveraging on phase shifting profilometry (PSP) codification techniques. The SL Sensor was compared with to two commercial depth cameras - the Azure Kinect and RealSense L515. Experiments showed that the SL Sensor surpasses the two devices in both precision and accuracy for indoor surface reconstruction applications. Furthermore, to demonstrate SL Sensor's ability to be a structured light sensing research platform for robotic applications, a motion compensation strategy was developed that allows the SL Sensor to operate during linear motion when traditional PSP methods only work when the sensor is static. Field experiments show that the SL Sensor is able to produce highly detailed reconstructions of spray plastered surfaces. The robot operating system (ROS)-based software and a sample hardware build of the SL Sensor are made open-source with the objective to make structured light sensing more accessible to the construction robotics community. © 2022 The Authors","Construction robotics; High accuracy 3D scanning; Open source; Phase shifting profilometry; ROS; Structured light scanning","Cameras; Error compensation; Motion compensation; Open source software; Profilometry; Robot Operating System; 3D-scanning; Construction robotics; High accuracy 3d scanning; High-accuracy; Light sensing; Open-source; Phase shifting profilometry; Phase-shifting; Structured Light; Structured light scanning; Open systems","","","","","HILTI; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (871542); European Commission, EC, (H2020-ICT-2019-2 871542); Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich, ETH, (SEED-14 20-2)","This research was proposed and partially funded by an ETH Career Seed grant [grant no SEED-14 20-2 ].

In this study, the influence of different post-treatments including T6 thermal treatment and laser shock peening were investigated individually and synergistically together with electro-chemical polishing on microstructure, surface morphology, roughness, hardness and residual stresses as well as rotating bending fatigue behavior of V-notched LPBF AlSi10Mg samples. The results indicated that laser shock peening has a high potential to close the sub-surface pores up to a depth of 390 and 420 µm leading to an overall mean porosity reduction of 52% and 62% in the as-built and heat treated samples, respectively. In addition, the hybrid post-treatment of heat treatment + laser shock peening + electro-chemical polishing was found to remarkably improve the fatigue life up to 400 times longer compared to the as-built state. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing;

The build size limitations and high production costs of L-PBF make it competitive for smaller, highly complex components, while the less complex elements of an assembly are manufactured conventionally. This leads to scenarios that use L-PBF only where it’s beneficial, and it require an integration and joining to form the final product. For example, L-PBF combustion swirlers are welded onto cast parts to produce combustion systems for stationary gas turbines. Today, the welding process requires complex welding fixtures and tack welds to ensure the correct alignment and positioning of the parts for repeatable weld results. In this paper, L-PBF and milled weld preparations are presented as a way to simplify the Tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding of rotationally symmetrical geometries using integrated features for alignment and fixation. Pipe specimens with the proposed designs are manufactured in Inconel 625 using L-PBF and milling. The pipe assembly is tested and TIG welding is performed for validation. 3D scans of the pipes before and after welding are evaluated, and the weld quality is examined via metallography and computed tomography (CT) scans. All welds produced in this study passed the highest evaluation group B according to DIN 5817. Thanks to good component alignment, safe handling, and a stable welding process, the developed designs eliminate the need for part-specific fixtures, simplify the process chain, and increase the process reliability.

However, lean premixed flames are susceptible to thermoacoustic instabilities, lean blowout, and flashback. The design of such a combustion system is thus always related to the balancing between the levels of emissions and flame stability. Data-driven optimization methods and the adaptation of models through artificial intelligence have experienced a surge in development in the past years. The goal of this study is to show the potential of these methods for gas turbine burner development. A special pilot burner that features 61 different positions of fuel injection, manufactured by means of selective laser melting is used to modify the gas mixture close to the flame anchoring position. Each of the injector lines is equipped with an individual valve, such that the distribution of fuel-air mixture can be modified variously. Installed into an industrial MGT6000 swirl combustor, a data-driven optimization method is used to find an optimal subset of injection locations by automated experiments. The method uses a surrogate model that is based on Gaussian processes regression. It is adopted for experimental optimization, keeping measurement efforts to a minimum. The optimizer controls the fuel valves and uses live measurements to find a distribution that generates minimal NOx emissions while ensuring flame stability. The solutions found by the optimization scheme are analyzed and advantages and limitations of the approach are discussed.

However, the understandings on the mechanical responses of lightweight TPMS structures by μLPBF are yet to be updated. Herein, stainless steel 316L TPMS shell lattices (i.e., Primitive (P), Diamond (D) and Gyroid (G)) with different shell thicknesses and cell orientations were fabricated by µLPBF. Low-density TPMS structures with shell thickness as small as ∼100 μm and relative density ∼5 % were realized. Quasi-static compression tests and finite element modelling were conducted to study their compressive responses. Their light-weighting potential related to the scaling behavior of mechanical properties as a function of relative density was analyzed. Results show with increasing relative density, the deformation mechanism transforms from localized collapse to homogeneous bulk deformation. P-type TPMS exhibits the highest anisotropy of stiffness, strength and energy absorption capability, while G-type TPMS is near-isotropic. [1 0 0] oriented D-type TPMS shows the highest strength and best light-weighting potential. Compared with conventional LPBF, the µLPBF TPMS structures demonstrate higher mechanical properties and superior light-weighting potential. Overall, this work highlights the superiority of the µLPBF technology in fabricating lightweight TPMS structures for mechanical applications. © 2022","Deformation mechanism; Energy absorption; Light-weighting potential; Micro laser powder bed fusion; Triply periodic minimal surface","Compression testing; Deformation; Density (specific gravity); Shells (structures); Deformation mechanism; Laser powders; Light-weighting potential; Lightweighting; Micro laser powder bed fusion; Microlaser; Powder bed; Surface shells; Triply periodic minimal surfaces; Weighting potential; Energy absorption","","","","","Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU; Chinese University of Hong Kong, CUHK; Shun Hing Institute of Advanced Engineering, SHIAE","The authors would like to thank GRF Project of 15228621 and Projects 1-ZE1W and 1-CD4H from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

A combustible illuminating candle shell slurry formulation was designed, with light-curing resin, magnesium powder, and sodium nitrate as the main components, and was printed and molded by DLP light-curing 3D printing technology to test its luminescence properties, mechanical properties, compatibility, and moisture absorption. The results show that the optimal formulation mass fraction of energy-containing slurry for the 3D printing of the combustible lighting candle shell is 50% for light-curing resin, 41% for sodium nitrate (NaNO3), and 9% for magnesium powder (Mg). The mechanical properties of the shell are good, with tensile strength up to 9.82 MPa and compressive strength of 102.86 MPa, and the compatibility of the components of the formulation is good, with stable combustion, and can provide 4.73% of light intensity for the lighting candle. © 2022 by the authors.","combustible shells; light-curing 3D printing; luminescence properties; mechanical properties","","","","","","","","Back S., Son Y., Lim S., Myung I., Storage life estimation of magnesium flare material for 81 mm illuminating projectile, J.

However, owing to its chemical inertness, the integration between PEEK implants and soft tissue represents a major challenge threatening the early success of the PEEK implants. Here we investigated the influence of hydroxyapatite (HA) fillers and porous structure of AM HA/PEEK scaffolds on the integration with soft tissue through in-vitro cellular experiments and in-vivo rabbit experiments. Among the animal experiments, HA/PEEK composite scaffolds with HA contents of 0, 20 wt%, 40 wt% and pore sizes of 0.8 mm, 1.6 mm were manufactured by fused filament fabrication. The results indicated that HA promoted the proliferation and adhesion of myofibroblasts on PEEK-based composites by releasing Ca2+ to active FAK and its downstream proteins, while the surface morphology of the scaffolds was also roughened by the HA particles, both of which led to the tighter adhesion between HA/PEEK scaffolds and soft tissue in-vivo. The macroscopic bonding force between soft tissue and scaffolds was dominated by the pore size of the scaffolds but was hardly affected by neither the HA content and nor the surface morphology. Scaffolds with larger pore size bonded more strongly to the soft tissue, and the maximum bonding force reached to 5.61 ± 2.55 N for 40 wt% HA/PEEK scaffolds with pore size of 1.6 mm, which was higher than that between natural bone and soft tissue of rabbits. Although the larger pore size and higher HA content of the PEEK-based scaffolds facilitated the bonding with the soft tissue, the consequent outcome of reduced mechanical properties has to be compromised in the design of the porous PEEK-based composite implants. The present study provides engineering-accessible synergistic strategies on material components and porous architecture of AM PEEK orthopaedic implants for improving the integration with soft tissue. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Polyether-ether-ketone composites; Porous scaffolds; Soft tissue","Animals; Benzophenones; Bone Substitutes; Durapatite; Ethers; Ketones; Polyethylene Glycols; Polymers; Porosity; Rabbits; 3D printers; Additives; Biomechanics; Chemical bonds; Ethers; Fillers; Hydroxyapatite; Ketones; Morphology; Scaffolds (biology); Surface morphology; Tissue; benzophenone derivative; ether derivative; hydroxyapatite; ketone; macrogol derivative; polyetheretherketone; polymer; Bonding forces; Composite scaffolds; Hydroxyapatite filler; In-vivo; Large pore size; Orthopaedic implants; Polyether-ether-ketone composite; Porous scaffold; Porous structures; Soft tissue; animal; bone prosthesis; chemistry; Leporidae; porosity; Adhesion","","hydroxyapatite, 1306-06-5, 51198-94-8; polyetheretherketone, 31694-16-3; Benzophenones, ; Bone Substitutes, ; Durapatite, ; Ethers, ; Ketones, ; polyetheretherketone, ; Polyethylene Glycols, ; Polymers, ","","","Key R&D Program of Guangdong Province, (2018B090906001); Key R&D Program of Ningxia Province, (2020BCH01001); Youth Innovation Team of Shaanxi Universities; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/T517793/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51835010); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2020M683458); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFE0207900); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi Province, (2022JQ-378); Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi Province; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2020B1515130002); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","The work was supported by the Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 51835010 ], Key R&D Program of Guangdong Province [grant number 2018B090906001 ], China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [grant number 2020M683458 ], the Natural Science Basic Research Program of ShaanXi Province [grant number 2022JQ-378 ], the National Key Research and Development Program of China [grant number 2018YFE0207900 ], the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) via DTP Case Programme [grant number EP/T517793/1 ], Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [grant number 2020B1515130002 ], Key R&D Program of Ningxia Province [grant number 2020BCH01001 ], the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities and the Youth Innovation Team of Shaanxi Universities .","Li Q., Zhang Y., Wang D., Wang H., He G., Mater.

Although some companies provide parameter sets that are perfectly adapted for their machines and filaments, a great variety of materials that can be processed on arbitrary printers are also available. Usually, the operator has to figure out ideal printing parameters in order to achieve high-quality results. In this work, an approach is presented relating the conclusions of differential scanning calorimetry, including the melting and glass transition temperatures and the decomposition points, to the printout quality. To give an overview of the common materials and to correlate the behavior of the printing parameters, 16 different filaments categorized into groups of plastics without additives, metals and carbon, woods, and stones have been investigated. Heat towers have been printed with each filament, whereby the individual floors in 5 °C steps represent the nozzle temperatures and show features for direct comparison. As a main result, it is shown that the optimal printing quality is achieved with temperatures on the colder end of the range between melting and decomposition. © 2022 Carl Hanser Verlag.

HIP is often used by default on LPBF components to reduce porosity and obtain the best mechanical properties, however, if the HIP temperatures are too high, there is a risk of reducing mechanical strength and corrosion resistance. The purpose of this work was to investigate the HIP parameters and understand the trade-off in properties. By choosing various HIP temperatures (700 °C, 1125 °C, 1200 °C), pressures (100 MPa, 137 MPa and 200 MPa) and hold times, optimal cycles were investigated based on the most favourable mechanical properties (density, hardness, tensile and low-cycle fatigue), and pitting corrosion resistance. Microstructural features associated with LPBF such as melt pools, melt pool boundaries and sub granular cells were observed. These features were found to disappear with longer and higher temperature treatments, accompanied by increased grain sizes. Low and mid temperature point HIP treatments resulted in higher ultimate tensile strength but lower fracture elongation. The decreasing hardness and tensile strength trends were consistent with decreased grain boundary strengthening and decreased dislocation strengthening (with disappearing sub grain boundary and granular cells). Only one HIP condition, consisting of a low temperature and medium pressure, produced samples that achieved runout under low cycle fatigue testing for both the lower and higher stresses. Despite this, most higher temperature HIP cycles reduced the fatigue resistance. This was again attributed to the coarsening of the microstructure at the higher temperature treatments. The spread of the pitting potentials of HIP treated samples was reduced by 52.46 % compared to the as-built material, although none were better overall compared to the wrought material. Of all the properties, porosity appears to play the most influential role on pitting corrosion, and to this extent, despite having a larger variation in results, some of the treated parts demonstrated improved pitting resistance and some demonstrated improved repassivation potentials compared to wrought 316L. © 2022 The Authors","Corrosion; Hot isostatic pressing; Laser powder bed fusion; Mechanical properties; Stainless steel 316L","Austenitic stainless steel; Coarsening; Corrosion fatigue; Corrosion resistance; Economic and social effects; Grain boundaries; Hardness; High-cycle fatigue; Low-cycle fatigue; Pitting; Sintering; Steel corrosion; Temperature; Tensile strength; 316L; Granular cells; Hot-isostatic pressings; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Melt pool; Powder bed; Pressing temperature; Property; Stainless steel (316L); Fatigue testing","","","","","Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Dstl, (DSTLX1000128518); Swansea University","Funding text 1: This work was funded by the Defence Science and Technology Lab (DSTL) Project code: DSTLX1000128518.

Herein, laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) method was utilized to fabricate an alumina-based ceramic mold with integral core and shell (CMCS). The influences of the component contents in the composite powder on fluidity and packing density were comprehensivley studied, and the optimized formulation for the composite powder was consequently determined as 88 wt% mixed spherical alumina (coarse: fine = 9:1), 12 wt% epoxy resin E12, and 0.1 wt% fumed silica. The vacuum infiltration process was adopted to improve mechanical properties of alumina ceramic after the sintering, where the solid loading of ceramic slurry was investigated. The CMCS was divided into two parts for fabrication, i.e., the core&shell and the base with a spiral grain selector, which could facilitate convenient of cleaning residual powder due to enlarged openings. After the first infiltration and pre-sintering, the separated two parts were bonded by a ceramic binder and then underwent second infiltration and final-sintering to obtain a complete CMCS. The alumina-based ceramic fabricated through L-PBF and post-treatment possessed low sintering shrinkage (1.51–2.03%), adequate apparent porosity (30.82 ± 0.01%), and room-temperature strength (13.03 ± 2.90 MPa for unbonded specimen, 9.72 ± 1.34 MPa for bonded specimen). Strikingly, the subsequent casting experiment has proved that the method proposed in this paper is promising to fabricate superior alumina-based CMCSs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Alumina-based; Ceramic mold; Infiltration; Laser powder bed fusion; Turbine blade","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Chemical stability; Creep resistance; Epoxy resins; Fabrication; Investment casting; Molds; Shrinkage; Silica; Sintering; Turbine components; Alumina-based; Ceramic mould; Composite powders; Fusion methods; Highest temperature; Investment casting process; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; Turbine blade; Turbomachine blades","","","","","Shanghai University Superalloy Blade Technology Research Center; Huazhong University of Science and Technology, HUST; National Major Science and Technology Projects of China, (2017-Ⅶ–0008–0102); National Major Science and Technology Projects of China","Funding text 1: Our research work presented in this paper was supported by National Science and Technology Major Project, China ( 2017-Ⅶ–0008–0102 ).

The requirement of intrabony nerve regeneration cannot be fulfilled by current therapeutic options, resulting in delayed innervation. Constructing a bone organoid which takes intrabony nerves into account can be a feasible approach. Herein, in combination with the nanocomposite bioinks and multicellular 3D bioprinting technology, a biomimetic neural-bone construct was successfully developed for innervated bone regeneration. Neural cells and bone-related cells were orderly printed to imitate the simplified spatial distribution of bone and nerves. Besides, inorganic calcium silicate (CS) nanowires were synthesized and incorporated into the bioinks to serve as “bioactive factors” to regulate multicellular behaviors. CS nanowires containing-bioinks could obviously promote the long-term survival and spreading as well as osteogenic and neurogenic differentiation of encapsulated cells. Furthermore, the in vivo results demonstrated that the CS nanowires containing-bioinks for 3D bioprinting of neural-bone constructs could simultaneously accelerate the new bone formation and ingrowth of nerve fibers. Taken together, this study offers a new concept by using inorganic nanomaterials as the bioactive components of bioinks for complex tissue regeneration, which represents a potential strategy for the fabrication of bone organoid with enhanced restoration of innervation and innervated bone tissues. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3D bioprinting; Bone organoids; Calcium silicate; Innervated bone regeneration; Neural-bone constructs","Biomimetics; Nanowires; Scaffolds (biology); Silicates; Tissue; Tissue regeneration; brain derived neurotrophic factor; calcium silicate; glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor; nanocomposite; nanowire; nerve growth factor; peripheral myelin protein 22; 3d bioprinting; Bioprinting; Bone formation; Bone organoid; Bone regeneration; Bone-constructs; Innervated bone regeneration; Neural-bone construct; Organoids; Silicate nanowires; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; assay; bone development; bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell; bone regeneration; bone remodeling; bone tissue; cell encapsulation; cell function; cell interaction; cell migration; cell structure; cell viability; controlled study; crystallization; cytoskeleton; gene expression level; histology; in vitro study; long term survival; micro-computed tomography; monoculture; nerve cell; nerve cell differentiation; nervous system development; nonhuman; ossification; protein expression; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; shear stress; synthesis; three dimensional bioprinting; upregulation; Calcium silicate","","brain derived neurotrophic factor, 218441-99-7; calcium silicate, 1344-95-2, 13983-17-0; nerve growth factor, 9061-61-4; peripheral myelin protein 22, 146869-16-1","","","Shanghai Pujiang Talent Program, (2020PJD080); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (32130062); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (JCTD-2018-13); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM, (20442420300, 21DZ1205600); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFB3800800); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2021YFB3800800 ), Natural Science Foundation of China ( 32130062 ), Innovation Cross Team of Chinese Academy of Sciences ( JCTD-2018-13 ), Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality ( 21DZ1205600 , 20442420300 ) and Shanghai Pujiang Talent Program ( 2020PJD080 ).

Specifically, a three-dimensional (3-D) inkjet printing technique is used to implement the conformal characteristics needed for the array. Both the radiators and substrate of the antenna array have been fabricated by combining the fused deposition modeling and microdroplet injection molding technologies, based on an existing 3-D printer. Here, through a unique combination of 3-D and 2-D inkjet printing of dielectric material and metallic ink, respectively, we demonstrate a monolithically integrated design for a nonplanar antenna for the first time. The antenna measurements herein show the complete characterization of this new process in terms of minimum feature size and achievable conductivities. This antenna configuration offers a high-gain performance with a low-cost and rapid fabrication technique by using 3-D printing techniques. To check our design, the voltage standing wave ratio and radiation patterns were tested after adding the newly designed feed structure. The results show that the design process is very efficient. Both the antenna element and the array demonstrate positive properties and are in very good agreement with the specially mounted platform. © 2022 by the authors.","conformal antenna array; fused deposition modeling; microdroplet injection molding; three-dimensional printing technique; tightly coupled antenna; ultra-wideband","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Key Research and Development Project of Hainan Province, (21310401D, 62071166); Key Research and Development Project of Hainan Province","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Key Research and Development Project of Hebei Province under Grants 62071166 and 21310401D, respectively.","Paulsen J.A., Renn M., Christenson K., Plourde R., Printing conformal electronics on 3D structures with aerosol jet technology, Proceedings of the Future of Instrumentation International Workshop (FIIW), pp. 1-4; Munk B., Taylor R., Durharn T., Croswell W., Pigon B., Boozer R., Brown S., Jones M., Pryor J., Ortiz S., Et al., A low-profile broadband phased array antenna, Proceedings of the IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium, 2; Zhao M.Y., Zhu Y.J., Wang T., Li T.P., Xiao B.L., Niu F.L., Lei X., A wideband scanning circularly polarized array antenna based on the shorted transmission line model, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 78493-78501, (2022); Jones M., Rawnick J., A new approach to broadband array design using tightly coupled elements, Proceedings of the IEEE Military Communications Conference, pp. 1-7; Xiao S., Yang S., Chen Y., Qu S.-W., Hu J., An ultra-wideband tightly coupled dipole array co-designed with low scattering characteristics, IEEE Trans.

By predicting the penetration depth of the ink, the ideal layer thickness for BJ can be set. Each layer should be penetrated with ink. Insufficient penetration will result in a poor layer bond and a low strength of the part; over-penetration will impede a dimensionally accurate production, as the ink will leak from the sides of the part and unintentionally solidify the powder in these areas. The Washburn equation has been used for the calculation of the penetration depth in various fields, such as hydrology or with loose powders. However, a transfer to the BJ process is difficult due to the preferably compact powder bed and the fine particles. In more compact powder beds, the small radii with their greater capillary pressure and their distribution in the layer have a high influence on the penetration depth. This work shows an adaptation of the Washburn equation for powder beds in BJ and a new approach to determine the effective pore radius for calculating the penetration depth. A weighted pore radius was introduced, which accounts for the spatial distribution of the pores in the powder bed and the acting capillary pressure. The validation was performed with two different powders by experimentally simulating the BJ process through the infiltration of a drop into a powder bed. The weighted radius was used in the Washburn equation to calculate the penetration depth. The results were compared with those models from the literature and experimental data, and a good agreement between the calculation and the experiment was found. © 2022 by the authors.","binder jetting; conceptual modeling; penetration depth; pore radius; Washburn equation","","","","","","Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, (ZF4748301CM9); Allianz Industrie Forschung, AiF","We hereby express our gratitude to the AiF for the funding of this work, within the framework ZIM of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action on the basis of a decision by the German Bundestag.

National diagnostic reference levels'(NDRL) have been established for adults, but neither NDRL's nor Local diagnostic reference levels'(LDRL) have been established for pediatric patients. Objective: This study aimed to assess radiation doses experienced by pediatric patients in CT brain procedure, and derive LDRLs. Materials and methods: The values of three radiological indexes: Volume CT dose index'(CTDIvol) and dose-length product'(DLP) were assessed. Then effective dose'(ED) were estimated, and LDRLs are suggested for CT procedures based on data retrieved from 353'pediatric patients aged between 0 and 15'years'old. LDRLs were estimated based on age and weight. Results: Built on 75'percent of the median distribution of the CTDIvol and DLP values, weight assemblage LDRL values ranged from 12.29 to 28.72'mGy and from 173.32 to 565.38'mGy.cm, respectively, whereas age assemblage LDRL values ranged from 11.76 to 25.07'mGy and from 147.04 to 479.23'mGy.cm, respectively. Conclusion: This study derived the typical CTDIvol, DLP, and ED received by pediatric patient during CT brain procedure in Saudi Arabia. Then, LDRLs were proposed based on age and weight for pediatric patients aged between 0 to 15'years'old.  © SFRP, 2022.","Child; CT; Dose-length product; Effective dose; Head; Volume CT dose index","Computerized tomography; Diagnosis; Dosimetry; Child; Computed tomography'; Diagnostic reference levels; Dose-length products; Effective dose; Head; Local diagnostic reference levels; Pediatric patients; Saudi Arabia; Volume computed tomography' dose index; Pediatrics","","","","","","","Al Mohiy H., Sim J., Seeram E., Annabell N., Geso M., Mandarano G., Davidson R., A dose comparison survey in CT departments of dedicated paediatric hospitals in Australia and Saudi Arabia, World J.

Due to its properties, PS is an interesting material for the fabrication of microfluidic systems. In microfluidics, rapid prototyping is of high importance for testing new chip layouts and designs during the product development with the aim of significantly accelerating the manufacturing. To allow transitioning and thus significantly faster translation from research to scalable manufacturing, it would be ideal if the same material could be used throughout the whole design pipeline. However, rapid prototyping and high-resolution shaping of PS, especially on the micron scale, is still limited. In this work,a novel photocurable polystyrene photoresin, is presented which can be shaped using direct optical lithography. Using this PS photoresin, microfluidic chips with feature sizes down to 50 µm and a high optical transparency can be fabricated. The cured PS photoresin shows comparable surface and material properties to commercial PS. This method will enable researchers in the medical, biological and biomedical fields to produce suitable PS structures with commercial equipment. © 2022 The Authors.

A sparse array with elements seeded in a tapering spiral pattern enables one-to-one connection to an ultrasound machine, thus allowing flexible transmission and reception strategies. To test the concept of sparse spiral array imaging, we have designed, realized, and characterized two prototype probes designed at 2.5-MHz low-frequency (LF) and 5-MHz high-frequency (HF) center frequencies. Both probes share the same electronic design, based on piezoelectric ceramics and rapid prototyping with printed circuit board substrates to wire the elements to external connectors. Different center frequencies were achieved by adjusting the piezoelectric layer thickness. The LF and HF prototype probes had 88% and 95% of working elements, producing peak pressures of 21 and 96 kPa/V when focused at 5 and 3 cm, respectively. The one-way -3-dB bandwidths were 26% and 32%. These results, together with experimental tests on tissue-mimicking phantoms, show that the probes are viable for volumetric imaging. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","matrix array; PZT-on-printed circuit board (PCB); sparse array; Three-dimensional (3-D) imaging; transducer; two-dimensional (2-D) array; ultrasound (US); volume imaging","Ceramics; Equipment Design; Phantoms, Imaging; Transducers; Ultrasonography; Piezoelectric ceramics; Piezoelectricity; Printed circuit boards; Probes; Substrates; Transducers; Ultrasonics; 2-D array; 3-D imaging; Aperture; Finite element analyse; Gold; Matrix arrays; PZT; PZT-on-PCB; Sparse arrays; Spiral; Volume imaging; ceramics; chemistry; echography; equipment design; imaging phantom; transducer; Finite element method","","","","","","","Yu J., Yoon H., Khalifa Y.M., Emelianov S.Y., Design of a volumetric imaging sequence using a vantage-256 ultrasound research platform multiplexed with a 1024-element fully sampled matrix array, IEEE Trans.

Coarse columnar grains and fine grains exist simultaneously in the cylinder or bulk W specimens fabricated by bi-directional scanning. The single-directional scanning used in wall-shape specimen fabrication facilitates the epitaxial growth of W grains, forming regular elongated columnar grains. Cracks were found in all the specimens, the formation of cracks in W during LPBF is determined by a combination of the localized stress distribution and the intrinsic strength/ductility of the W phase. Cracks are concentrated at the grain boundaries where the coarse columnar grain and fine grains are adjacent. With the specimen size increased from cylinder (slender cylinder, squat cylinder), wall (thin wall) to the bulk specimen (with 0–2 mm support), more cracks were found due to higher residual stress. Cracks could relieve the residual stress dramatically, which leads to the decrease of the dislocation density, therefore, with the increase in specimen size, both low angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) and the geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) density decrease. Adding support structure in bulk W could decrease the cooling rate and increase the cooling time. Low cooling rate can reduce the stress level as well as the generation of cracks. Long cooling time could provide sufficient time for dislocation nucleation and movement to form LAGBs structure. Therefore, there are fewer cracks and higher GNDs density/LAGBs portion inside the W phase with a higher support structure. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Geometrical shapes; Laser powder bed fusion;

However, conducting tests on the creep of concrete with multiple influencing variables is time-consuming and costly. This paper presents a random forest (RF)-based model for the parameters (viscosity coefficient η and fractional derivative order α) of the FDMs based on the updated Infrastructure Technology Institute of Northwestern University (NU-ITI) database with 748 sets by the Levenberg–Marquardt method, and 10 influential variables in the database. Further, a Bayesian optimization-based random forest (BO-RF) model to more accurately and efficiently predict η and α of the FDM is also proposed. The results show that Bayesian optimization can effectively search for the optimal hyper-parameters of the RF model and achieve high prediction accuracy with determination coefficients 0.972 and 0.965 on the testing sets, respectively. Moreover, the statistical values of CEB coefficient of variation and CEB mean square error method for the FDM model based on BO-RF prediction results can achieve 13.03% and 3.96%, respectively. Finally, by measuring the relative importance of the variables, it is observed that the loading time t0 has the highest importance for both η and α, followed by temperature for η and aggregate cement ratio for α. © 2022, RILEM.","Bayesian optimization; Concrete creep; Fractional derivative; Random forest; Variable importance","Concretes; Creep; Forecasting; Mean square error; Random forests; Based modelling; Bayesian optimization; Concrete creep; Creep model; Fractional derivative model; Fractional derivatives; Model parameter estimation; Random forest modeling; Random forests; Variable importances; Decision trees","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51778044); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","The authors acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation (NSFC) of PR China (No. 51778044).

Infill pattern creates a microstructure that affects the mechanical performance as well. Whenever the length ratio of microstructure to geometry converges to one, metamaterials emerge and the strain-gradient theory is an adequate model to predict metamaterials response. All metamaterial parameters are determined by an asymptotic homogenization, and we investigate the effects of infill density and pattern on these parameters. In order to illuminate the role of infill characteristics on the strain-gradient parameters, an in-depth numerical investigation is presented for one, widely used case in three-dimensional (3D) printers, rectangular grid. © The Author(s) 2022.","additive manufacturing;

The design rules are based on scaling laws that capture the change in the meniscus oscillation relaxation time with geometric characteristics of the nozzle's inner profile. These characteristics include volume, cross-sectional area, and inner surface area of the nozzle. Using boundary layer theory for a simple geometry, we show that the meniscus settles faster when the ratio of inner surface area to volume is increased. High-fidelity multiphase flow simulations verify this scaling. We use these laws to explore several design concepts with parameterized classes of shapes that reduce the meniscus relaxation time while preserving desired droplet specifications. Our findings enable exploration of nozzle concepts that can achieve optimal performance by increasing the ratio of the circumferential surface area to the bulk volume to the extent that is allowable by manufacturing constraints. © 2022 Author(s).","","3D printers; Boundary layers; Nozzle design; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Design rules; Drop-on-demand; Geometric characteristics; High frequency HF; High-throughput; Inner surfaces; Physics-based; Surface area; Liquid metals","","","","","","","Sukhotskiy V., Vishnoi P., Karampelas I.H., Vader S., Vader Z., Furlani E.P., Magnetohydrodynamic drop-on-demand liquid metal additive manufacturing: System overview and modelling, pp. 1-6, (2018); Simonelli M., Aboulkhair N., Rasa M., East M., Tuck C., Wildman R., Salomons O., Hague R., Towards digital metal additive manufacturing via high-temperature drop-on-demand jetting, Addit.

In this work, a polymeric nanocomposite hydrogel-based ink solution was developed using boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) reinforced gelatin for 3D bioprinting of scaffolds. The ink solutions and printed scaffolds were characterised for their printability, mechanical, thermal, water uptake, and biological properties (cell viability and inflammation). The viscoelastic behaviour of the scaffolds indicated the increase in storage modulus with an increase in BNNTs composition. Additionally, the compressive strength of the scaffolds increased from 9.43 ± 1.3 kPa to 30.09 ± 1.5 kPa with the addition of BNNTs. Similarly, the thermal stability of the scaffolds enhanced with an increase in BNNTs composition. Furthermore, the scaffolds with a higher concentration of BNNTs displayed resilience in cell culture media at 37 °C for up to 14 days compared with pure gelatin scaffolds. The cell viability results showed a decreased viability rate with an increased concentration of BNNTs scaffolds. However, BNNTs incubated with cells did not display cytokine inflammation. Therefore, this work provides a potential hydrogel-based ink solution for 3D bioprinting of biomimetic tissue constructs with adequate structural stability for a wide range of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D bioprinted scaffold; Bioprinting; Boron nitride nanotubes; Cell viability; Cytokine inflammation; Gelatin; Hydrogels-based ink solution; THP-1; Tissue engineering","Biocompatible Materials; Bioprinting; Boron Compounds; Cytokines; Gelatin; Humans; Hydrogels; Inflammation; Ink; Nanogels; Nanotubes; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; Water; Biomimetics; Boron nitride; Cell culture; Cell engineering; Cells; Compressive strength; Forecasting; III-V semiconductors; Nanotubes; Nitrides; Pathology; Reinforcement; Scaffolds (biology); Thermodynamic stability; Tissue; biomaterial; boron derivative; boron nitride; cytokine; gelatin; hydrogel; ink; nanogel; nanotube; water; 3d bioprinted scaffold; Bioprinting; Boron nitride nanotubes; Cell viability; Cytokine inflammation; Cytokines; Gelatin; Hydrogel-based ink solution; THP-1; Tissues engineerings; bioprinting; chemistry; human; inflammation; procedures; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; Hydrogels","","gelatin, 9000-70-8; water, 7732-18-5; Biocompatible Materials, ; Boron Compounds, ; boron nitride, ; Cytokines, ; Gelatin, ; Hydrogels, ; Nanogels, ; Water, ","","","La Trobe University Bioimaging Facility","The authors thank Veronica Glattauer and Ilona Turek for the valuable suggestions in cell culture experiments and analysis.

The fingers of the soft gripper were 3D printed simultaneously along with the pTSC, without requiring support materials, using an inexpensive fused deposition modeling 3D printer. The pTSCs embedded in the fingers have numerous advantages, including fast response, repeatability, reliability, negligible hysteresis, stability over time, durability, and very low power consumption. Finite element modeling is used to predict the behavior of the pTSCs under different body contacts and to design their topology. Real-time pressure/force control was performed experimentally based on the feedback data provided by the pTSCs to grasp various objects with different weights, shapes, sizes, textures, and stiffnesses using an experimentally tuned proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller with the same gains for all the objects grasped. In other words, the gripper can self-adapt to different environments with different stiffnesses and provide stable contact and grasping. These results are validated theoretically by modeling the soft gripper in contact with the objects with varying stiffness to show that the stability of the contact motion is not affected by the stiffness of the environment (i.e., the grasped object) when constant PID control gains are used.  © 2022 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","3D printing; force control; soft grasping; soft grippers; soft robot control; soft sensors","3D modeling; 3D printers; Grippers; Pneumatics; Proportional control systems; Stiffness; Textures; Three term control systems; Two term control systems; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Real- time; Robots control; Soft grasping; Soft gripper; Soft robot; Soft robot control; Soft sensors; Touch sensing; Force control","","","","","University of Wollongong, UOW; Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science, Australian Research Council, ARC, (CE140100012)","This research was supported by the ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science (grant no.

For reasons of computational tractability, all existing methods use simplified approximations of a robot's kinodynamic model. We empirically confirm that any model approximations that are not physically consistent, i.e., the kinodynamic model parameters do not accurately reflect the actual link shapes, can sometimes lead to large errors in the optimization. We then propose a physically consistent, Lie group-based mesh element model for robot links that (i) parametrizes a wide variety of link shapes, and (ii) provides closed-form analytic gradients for the mesh deformations. The latter property is key to developing efficient co-design optimization algorithms that significantly improve numerical convergence and stability. Our co-design methodology is validated through extensive numerical and hardware experiments involving 3D-printed serial and parallel robots.  © 2016 IEEE.","Computational geometry; motion optimization; optimization and optimal control; robot co-design; robot optimal design","3D printers; Job analysis; Lie groups; Mesh generation; Robots; Co-designs; Computational modelling; Motion optimization; Optimal design; Optimisations; Optimization and optimal control; Robot co-design; Robot optimal design; Shape; Task analysis; Machine design","","","","","","","Ha S., Coros S., Alspach A., Bern J.M., Kim J., Yamane K., Computational design of robotic devices from high-level motion specifications, IEEE Trans.

It is known that the MP cooling and heating rates, and laser processing parameters can critically determine the grain structure and thereby affect the part properties. The objective of this work is to study the feasibility of using in-process, high-speed imaging pyrometry for evaluating the solidified MP properties “below” the surface, such as depth and microstructural properties. To accomplish this, we employ an in-house single camera-based two-wavelength imaging pyrometry (STWIP) system for monitoring the printing of single-scan tracks with Inconel 718 on a commercial LPBF printer (EOS M290). The lab designed STWIP system is a coaxial high-speed (>10,000 fps) imaging system capable of monitoring MP temperature, morphology, and intensity profiles. The temperature measurements from STWIP are emissivity independent. The STWIP measured MP signatures of the printed tracks are correlated with the ex-situ microscopy characterized MP depth and the average grain lengths. From the data analysis, using support vector machine (SVM)-based regression models, we found that the MP temperature signatures are crucial for an accurate prediction of MP depth and the grain length, thus validating the novelty and necessity of the developed in-situ monitoring methods and analysis. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Coaxial high-speed imaging; In-situ melt pool monitoring; Inconel 718; Laser powder bed fusion; Melt pool morphology; Melt pool temperature","Heating; High speed cameras; Lakes; Monitoring; Morphology; Pyrometers; Regression analysis; Support vector machines; Coaxial high-speed imaging; High speed imaging; In-situ melt pool monitoring; Inconel-718; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Melt pool; Melt pool morphology; Melt pool temperature; Powder bed; Pyrometry","","","","","Department of Energy University, (FE0031774); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; University of Pittsburgh","Funding text 1: C.K.V. and X.Z. would like to acknowledge partial support from the Department of Energy University Turbine Systems Research grant (Award Number: FE0031774 ). ; Funding text 2: We would like to thank Brandon Blasko who helped us with LPBF printing and EDM cutting.

Printing curved and complex patterns, however, requires additional attention and planning to achieve accurate fiber placement. In this context, the jet speed, as measured by the critical translation speed (CTS), is found to be an essential factor for accurately direct-writing complex nonlinear patterns. When the jet and the translation speed match, the vertical jet better approximates the tool path when the printing is nonlinear. As demonstrated here, the entire printed structure gradually deforms when the jet lag increases. For the first time with MEW, circular arc toolpaths are focused on to expand the design complexity, and there is evidence that the resolution is further improved by printing slightly under the CTS. When using such circular arc toolpaths, inwards tilting of the fiber walls can be observed and can be corrected with microscale layer shifting, shown with scaffolds based on knitting-type designs. The combination of printing at the CTS with circular arcs increases the manufacturing complexity of curved patterns and has implications for the design and utility of MEW. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","3D jetting; electrohydrodynamic jetting; melt electrospinning writing; scaffold","Manufacture; Scaffolds; 3d jetting; Additive manufacturing technology; Circular arc; Curved patterns; Electrohydrodynamic jetting; High resolution; Melt electrospinning; Melt electrospinning writing; Toolpaths; Translation speed; Electrohydrodynamics","","","","","","","Campbell I., Bourell D., Gibson I., Rapid Prototyping J., 18, (2012); Moroni L., Boland T., Burdick J.A., De Maria C., Derby B., Forgacs G., Groll J., Li Q., Malda J., Mironov V.A., Mota C., Nakamura M., Shu W., Takeuchi S., Woodfield T.B.F., Xu T., Yoo J.J., Vozzi G., Trends Biotechnol., 36, (2018); Gong J., Schuurmans C.C.L., Genderen A.M.V., Cao X., Li W., Cheng F., He J.J., Lopez A., Huerta V., Manriquez J., Li R., Li H., Delavaux C., Sebastian S., Capendale P.E., Wang H., Xie J., Yu M., Masereeuw R., Vermonden T., Zhang Y.S., Nat.

High-temperature resistojets improve the economics of small satellites and are an attractive technology for auxiliary propulsion on all-electric geosynchronous satellites. Additive manufacturing was used to economically produce the geometrically complex heating element. Endurance tests were performed on heaters and full thruster assemblies. Eight engineering model thrusters were tested, with five manufactured from Inconel 625, and three having a tantalum heater and nozzle operating at higher temperatures. The eight units were operated in vacuum to determine their endurance. The Inconel thrusters were operated at 30 W electrical power, while the tantalum thrusters were operated at 60 W, representative of intended operating conditions. Measurements of temperature and electrical resistance throughout the tests were used to infer the condition of the thrusters. Following a retrofit of two of the Inconel 625 thrusters with a modified component to mechanically support the heater, they completed 6000 heating cycles without failure. The tantalum thrusters, equipped from the outset with the modified component, completed 10000 heating cycles. Both variants exceeded the minimum cycle requirement of 4000. This work demonstrates the operational feasibility of additive-manufactured, high-temperature resistojets. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; All-electric spacecraft; Endurance testing; Resistojet; Spacecraft propulsion","3D printers; Additives; Geostationary satellites; Spacecraft propulsion; All-electric spacecraft; Endurance test; Endurance testing; Engineering modelling; Geosynchronous satellites; Heating cycles; Highest temperature; Inconel 625; Resistojet; Small-satellite; Tantalum","","","","","National Space Technology Program 2; Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd; UK Space Agency, UKSA; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/L01582X/1); University of Southampton; Innovate UK","Funding text 1: The work in this paper forms part of a PhD studentship funded through the Centre for Doctoral Training in Sustainable Infrastructure Systems (CDT-SIS) at University Of Southampton.

One of the key manufacturing constraints is the use of support structures for overhang features, which are indispensable in AM processes, but increase material consumption, manufacturing costs, and build time. Therefore, controlling support structure generation is a significant issue in fabricating functional products directly using AM. The goal of this paper is to propose a knowledge-based design algorithm for reducing support structures whilst considering printability and as-printed quality. The proposed method consists of three steps: (1) AM ontology development, for characterizing a target AM process, (2) Surrogate model construction, for quantifying the impact of the AM parameters on as-printed quality, (3) Design and process modification, for reducing support structures and optimizing the AM parameters. The significance of the proposed method is to not only optimize process parameters, but to also control local geometric features for a better surface roughness and build time reduction. To validate the proposed algorithm, case studies with curve-based (1D), surface-based (2D), and volume (3D) models were carried out to prove the reduction of support generation and build time while maintaining surface quality. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; design modification; knowledge base; process optimization; support reduction","Additives; Ground supports; Knowledge based systems; Optimization; Process control; Product design; Structural design; Surface roughness; % reductions; Build time; Design freedom; Design modifications; Knowledge base; Knowledge based design; Manufacturing constraint; Process optimisation; Support reduction; Support structures; 3D printers","","","","","NRF-2021R1I1A3044394, (NRF-2021R1F1A1062804); Ministry of Environment, MOE, (NRF-2021R1F1A1063297); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Programs through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Korean government (MSIT and MOE) (No. NRF-2021R1F1A1063297, No. NRF-2021R1I1A3044394 and No. NRF-2021R1F1A1062804).","Nickels L., AM and Aerospace: An Ideal Combination, Met.

In view of differences in the optimization of machine printing parameters for objectives with different quality requirements, this paper discusses how the control factors consisting of machine printing parameters can obtain objects with a high quality through an experimental design with full considerations of the separation force and dimensional tolerance. By taking the titling separation mechanism as an example, the importance, contribution, and best calculation results of the control factors in forming a separation force and four dimensional tolerances are obtained using the Taguchi method and an analysis of variance, and then the optimal solution for multiple objectives is obtained via the desirability approach. It was found from this study that the rising speed of the forming platform is the most important parameter affecting the dimensional tolerance and separation force. The slice layer thickness has an inverse characteristic for optimizing the dimensional tolerance of the aperture and the face width. Regarding multi-objective optimization, it will not change the optimal printing parameters considering the minimum separation force and overall dimensional tolerance, regardless of the weight of the separation force. © 2022 by the author.","3D printing; ANOVA; desirability approach; Digital Light Processing; Taguchi method","","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (111-2621-M-110-001); Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST","The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Science and Technology, R.O.C., for financial support MOST 111-2621-M-110-001.","Yanar N., Kallem P., Son M., Park H., Kang S., Choi H., A New era of water treatment technologies: 3D printing for membranes, J.

In particular, there are relatively few studies on the compressive recovery ability of NiTi alloys by the laser-directed energy deposition (LDED) process. In this paper, the compression recovery properties of NiTi alloys with the LDED process were investigated quasi-in-situ by means of transmission electron microscopy, an electron backscatter diffractometer, and focused ion beam–fixed-point sample preparation. The results showed that the material can be completely recovered under 4% deformation and the B19’ martensite phase content and dislocation density are basically unchanged. However, the recovery rate was only 90% and the unrecoverable strain was 0.86% at 8% deformation. Meanwhile, the B19’ martensite phase content and dislocation density of the material increased. Furthermore, with the increase in deformation, the relative dislocation pinning effect of the Ti2Ni precipitated phase in the alloy was enhanced, which reduced the compressive strain recovery to a certain extent. © 2022 by the authors.","compression; dislocation pinning; laser additive manufacturing; microstructure transformation; recovery ability","3D printers; Additives; Binary alloys; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Ion beams; Martensite; Microstructure; Recovery; Titanium alloys; Compression; Deposition process; Directed energy; Dislocation pinning; Energy depositions; Laser additive manufacturing; Martensite phasis; Microstructure transformations; NiTi alloys; Recovery ability; Deformation","","","","","","","Elahinia M., Shayesteh-Moghaddam N., Taheri Andani A., Amerinatanzi A., Bimber B.A., Hamilton R.F., Fabrication of NiTi through additive manufacturing: A review, Prog.

To this aim, the recent advances in sensorization and processing of the associated signals using Machine Learning (ML) techniques have made in situ monitoring a viable alternative to post-mortem techniques such as X-ray tomography or ultrasounds for the assessment of parts. Indeed, the primary advantage of in situ monitoring over post-mortem analysis is that the process can be stopped in case of discrepancies, saving resources. Additionally, mitigations to repair the discrepancies can also be performed. However, the in situ monitoring strategies based on classifying processing regimes reported in the literature so far operate on signals of fixed length in time, constraining the generalization of the trained ML model by not allowing monitoring processes with heterogeneous laser scanning strategies. As a part of this work, we try to bridge this gap by developing a hybrid Deep Learning (DL) model by combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) that can operate over variable time-scales. The proposed hybrid DL model was trained on signals obtained from a heterogeneous time-synced sensing system consisting of four sensors, namely back reflection (BR), Visible, Infra-Red (IR), and structure-borne Acoustic Emission (AE). The signals captured different phenomena related to the LPBF process zone and were used to classify three regimes: Lack of Fusion (LoF), conduction mode and Keyhole. Specifically, these three regimes were induced by printing cubes out of austenitic Stainless steel (316 L) on a mini-LPBF device with operando high-speed synchrotron X-ray imaging and signal acquisition with the developed heterogeneous sensing system. The operando X-ray imaging analysis ensured that the regimes correlated with the defined process parameters. During the validation procedure of the trained hybrid DL model, the model predicted three regimes with an accuracy of about 98% across various time scales, ranging from 0.5 ms to 4 ms. In addition to tracking the model performance, a sensitivity analysis of the trained hybrid model was conducted, which showed that the BR and AE sensors carried more relevant information to guide the decision-making process than the other two sensors used in this work. © 2022 The Authors","Acoustic Emission; Laser Powder Bed Fusion; Machine learning; Monitoring; Optical Emission","Acoustic emission testing; Austenitic stainless steel; Convolutional neural networks; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Monitoring; Powder metals; Sensitivity analysis; Time measurement; Acoustic-emissions; Fusion process; In-situ monitoring; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Learning models; Machine-learning; Operando; Optical emissions; Powder bed; Decision making","","","","","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (CRSII5_193799 / 1); Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF","We acknowledge the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI), Villigen, Switzerland, for the provision of synchrotron radiation beamtime at the TOMCAT beamline X02DA of the SLS.

For this proposed model, we show that the WL model exhibits asymptotic aggregation estimates so that all the elements in the generalized Wigner distribution matrix tend to a common one. On the other hand, for the global unique solvability, we employ the fixed point argument together with the classical semigroup theory to derive the global unique solvability of mild and classical solutions depending on the regularity of initial data. © 2022, American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

In this work we present an exposition of droplet impact on liquid films investigating the effects of mismatch in their properties on bouncing-to-merging transitions. Experiments are conducted for two sets of liquid combinations, namely, alkanes and silicon oils. The regime maps for impact outcomes (bouncing vs merging) are created from detailed experiments with various single- and two-liquid systems. The results highlight that the two-liquid systems exhibit an additional merging regime, which is not observed for single-liquid systems. Subsequently, the scaling analyses for transitional boundaries between various regimes are revisited, and new scaling laws are proposed to include the effects of asymmetry in the droplet and film properties. Finally, the experimental results are used to assess the performance of the proposed scaling laws.  © 2022 Author(s).","","Drops; Liquid films; Droplets impact; Industrial processs; Liquid droplets; Liquid system; Property; Regime map; Scaling analysis; Silicon oil; Transitional boundaries; Two-liquid systems; Merging","","","","","Jacobs School of Engineering of UCSD; National Science Foundation, NSF, (CBET-2145210); National Science Foundation, NSF","This work was funded by internal grants from the Jacobs School of Engineering of UCSD and external grants from the U.S. National Science Foundation (CAREER Award No. CBET-2145210).","Rein M., Phenomena of liquid drop impact on solid and liquid surfaces, Fluid Dyn.

Results show that the microstructure of both as-deposited and annealed alloys is composed of α2(Ti3Al), γ(TiAl), and β/B2 (β ordered to B2) phases. With the increase in annealing temperature, the microstructure changes significantly, and the content of β/B2 phase in lamellar clusters decreases gradually. However, the content of β/B2 phase between lamellar clusters increases, and its size increases. Compared with the as-deposited alloy, the content of β/B2 phase in the annealed alloy increases significantly. With the increase in annealing temperature, the γ(111) orientation texture strength of the annealing alloy decreases gradually. The results of tensile properties show that the tensile strength of as-deposited alloy is higher than that of annealed alloy at room temperature and high temperature. However, the elongation of Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb-5Ta alloy sample annealed at 1260°C/1h/furnace cooling (FC) secondary cycle is the highest at room temperature and 750 °C, and its values are 2.2 and 3.4%, respectively. © 2022, ASM International.","annealing treatment; laser additive manufacturing (LAM); tensile properties; β/B2 phase; γ-TiAl alloy","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Annealing; Chromium alloys; Niobium alloys; Tantalum alloys; Textures; Titanium alloys; Annealed alloys; Annealing temperatures; Annealing treatments; As-deposited alloy; B2 phase; Effect of annealing; Laser additive manufacturing; Β/b2 phase; Γ-(ti3al), γ alloy; Tensile strength","","","","","Dalian University of Technology, DUT, (XB2021005)","The work was supported by Ph.D. research startup foundation of Liaoning University of Technology (grant number XB2021005).

In this paper, the impact of three process parameters on interlayer bond strength in paste was investigated. Utilizing an alternative clay-based material in large-scale AM was considered in this research due to concerns about global carbon emissions associated with the concrete industry. This paper proposes an approach by manipulating process parameters that alter the geometry of the layers on the meso-scale to emulate densification and to enhance friction between consecutive layers by either periodically increasing print area or enhancing compaction during the print process. The standard flexural test was performed to obtain the flexural strength of 95 printed specimens. Results showed that periodically manipulating the standoff distance of the nozzle appears to function akin to compaction in conventional concrete casting methods and improves the interlayer bond strength under shear by 41% on average. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Bond strength; Clay; Concrete; Densification; Flexural strength; Large-scale additive manufacturing; Nozzle standoff distance; Process parameters; Robotic fabrication","Additives; Bending strength; Bond strength (materials); Compaction; Compressive strength; Concretes; Nozzles; Robotics; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Bond strength; Concrete; Densifications; Large-scale additive manufacturing; Large-scales; Nozzle standoff distance; Process parameters; Robotic fabrications; Stand-off distance (SoD); 3D printers","","","","","Texas A and M University, TAMU","This work was partially funded by the X-Grants Program: A President's Excellence Fund Initiative at Texas A&M University .","De Schutter G., Lesage K., Mechtcherine V., Nerella V.N., Habert G., Agusti-Juan I., Vision of 3D printing with concrete — technical, economic and environmental potentials, Cem.

However, the large range of relevant scales, high slopes, step-like transitions, undercuts, alternation between dark and overly bright regions and other complex features present on the surfaces, in particular of metal additive parts, represent a significant challenge for current optical measurement technologies. Measuring surfaces with such complex features requires high numerical aperture (NA) optics, and state-of-the-art systems commonly include optics that can only reliably acquire surface topographies over a small field of view (FOV), typically tens or hundreds of micrometers. Such measurements are often insufficient for practical applications. Here, we present an optical system that features a large NA ( > 0.3) and a wide FOV 2.9×2.9 mm, capable of measuring AM parts in a single measurement, without the need for lateral stitching to increase the FOV. The proposed system exhibits optical properties that provide facility for large-field, high-resolution measurement of industrially-produced additively manufactured parts.  © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.","additive manufacturing; field of view; numerical aperture; optical metrology","Additives; Optical data processing; Optical properties; Optical systems; Surface topography; Topography; 'current; Complex geometries; Complex shapes; Field of views; High slopes; Manufacturing IS; Measurements of; Metal additives; Numerical aperture; Optical Metrology; 3D printers","","","","","UK Research and Innovation, UKRI; Agència de Gestió d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca, AGAUR","N V, G C and M D would like to thank AGAUR for supporting this project with an Industrial PhD Grant DI-2021 19.

This research investigates the material characteristics of turning-style toolpath strategies to generate axisymmetric components with additive manufacturing (AM), referred to in this research as additive turning. This novel approach leverages existing CAM technology for turning, where the component rotates around a stationary cutting tool, to generate toolpath trajectories for DED with varying wall-thicknesses and controlled deposition angles. This strategy allows for entire components to be deposited in one continuous deposition, resulting in reduced cycle-time and improved material usage efficiency compared to conventional AM strategies where the beam is switched off at the end of every layer. Results from this study show that the use of additive turning can produce over 99 % dense components with less variation and anisotropy in texture and hardness, as well as a lower variation in elongation to failure when compared to conventional strategies. This research highlights that various CAM strategies could be deployed for AM to improve process efficiency or enable localized control over part performance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Computer aided manufacturing; Directed energy deposition; Grain structure; Stainless steel 316L","Additives; Austenitic stainless steel; Computer aided manufacturing; Cutting tools; Deposition; Industrial research; Textures; Component based; Computer-aided manufacturing; Directed energy; Directed energy deposition; Energy depositions; Free component; Manufacturing strategy; Manufacturing techniques; Performance; Stainless steel (316L); 3D printers","","","","","Carl Zeiss Industrial Metrology LLC; Okuma Corporation; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Advanced Manufacturing Office, AMO, (DE-AC05-00OR22725); Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the cooperation and support of the Okuma Corporation, Carl Zeiss Industrial Metrology LLC.

Many types of reinforcement, i.e., steel rebars, fiber-reinforced polymer, have been introduced to improve the structure's mechanical behavior under dynamic loading. In this paper, the Primitive minimal surface - one type of the triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) structure - is employed as reinforcement of cement-based beams. The TPMS-Primitive reinforcement scaffolds and molds are printed with thermoplastic Polylactic Acid (PLA) material, then pouring cementitious mortar to cast the beams. Different thicknesses and a linear functionally graded thickness of the TPMS-Primitive scaffolds are numerically investigated. This design helps address corrosion-associated failures in traditional reinforcement. Three types of beams, one- and two-layer TPMS-Primitive reinforced beams and one non-reinforced beam, are fabricated for impact tests. Experimental and numerical results are quite consistent in terms of the time history of impact forces, energy absorption, and failure patterns. The research outcomes indicate that considerable robustness in load-bearing ability is witnessed in TPMS-Primitive reinforced cementitious beams. Fabrication of this type of reinforcement can be achievable by using advanced additive manufacturing of recycled plastic. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Dynamic behavior; Impact load; Prefabricated construction; TPMS-Primitive reinforcement scaffolds","3D printers; Additives; Cements; Construction industry; Fiber reinforced plastics; Scaffolds; Steel corrosion; Steel fibers; Structural design; Cement concrete; Cementitious; Dynamic behaviors; Dynamic performance; Impact loads; Performance of cement; Reinforced beams; Steel rebars; Triply periodic minimal surface-primitive reinforcement scaffold; Triply periodic minimal surfaces; Dynamic loads","","","","","Vingroup Innovation Foundation; Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung, AvH; RMIT University, RMIT","Research is partially supported by Vingroup Innovation Foundation (VINIF) in project code VINIF.2019.

Open source extruders are less expensive than industrial extruders. However, they have little instrumentation, which limits processing analysis and thus the development of new materials, screw design and process control. Therefore, this project aims to develop a low-cost extruder with a high degree of instrumentation for in-situ process analysis. To achieve this, equipment was developed with an integrated circuit board, both with modularity, machine and peripheral control, process stability, and data acquisition. To validate the equipment, processing was done at constant temperature and with flow variation. The data obtained were the temperatures at different points in the barrel, the rotation speed of the extruder motor, the current consumed by the motor and the resistances, and the speed of the extruder motor. Thermal images of the components were obtained during processing, validating the type of material used in the parts manufactured by additive manufacturing. The ABS filament produced was analyzed by flow and surface analysis using a confocal microscope. Higher flow rates had a better surface quality of the filament. © 2022","Circular economy; Filament quality; In situ process; Pilot plant","Data acquisition; Extruders; Life cycle; Process control; Surface analysis; Circuit boards; Circular economy; Clean technologies; Filament quality; In-situ process; Low-costs; Open-source; Process analysis; Reuse; Screw design; Pilot plants","","","","","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (168694/2018-2, 2019/14694-0, 305959/2017-4)","Acknowledgement to the funding agencies CNPq process 168694/2018-2 and 305959/2017-4.

Because phase transformation usually occurs in high interfacial energy regions, heterogeneous microstructures with inclusions may induce a unique phase transformation during plastic deformation or temperature changes. In this study, transformation-induced plasticity in a heterogeneous microstructured Ti-Zr-Nb-Sn alloy was investigated. To design a heterogeneous microstructure, in situ alloying with directed energy deposition and elemental powders was conducted, and unmelted Nb particles were distributed in the β-Ti matrix. The high interfacial energy between the unmelted Nb particles and the β-Ti matrix supports the initiation of deformation-induced α′′ martensite, while no phase transformation occurs at the grain boundaries. Moreover, the heterogeneous microstructure and transformation-induced plasticity of the in-situ alloyed Ti-Nb-Zr-Sn alloy contribute to their high strength (700.8 MPa) by accumulating geometrically necessary dislocations and absorbing plastic deformation energy, respectively. This result indicates that the heterogeneous microstructure design with laser-based additive manufacturing is helpful for manipulating phase transformation in specific regions, which allows the adjustment of the local shape memory effect and plastic deformation in complex-shaped parts. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Mechanical property; Microstructure; Strengthening; Titanium","3D printers; Additives; Alloying; Deposition; Grain boundaries; High strength alloys; Interfacial energy; Linear transformations; Microstructure; Phase transitions; Plastic deformation; Shape-memory alloy; Titanium alloys; Zircaloy; Directed energy; Energy depositions; Heterogeneous microstructure; Metallic alloys; Phase transformation behavior; Phases transformation; Shape-memory effect; Strengthening; Titania; Transformation induced plasticity; Niobium alloys","","","","","Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy of the Republic of Korea, (20214000000480); POSCO; POSCO TJ Park Foundation; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2020R1A4A3079417, NRF-2021R1A2C3006662); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government ( MSIT ) [ 2020R1A4A3079417 ].

Prior work revealed that receiving DfAM heuristics at different points in the design process impacts the quality and novelty of designs produced afterward, but this work may have been limited by the solely virtual format. In this work, an identical experiment was performed in a face-to-face learning environment. Results indicate that neither learning format presents an advantage over the other when it comes to the quality of designs produced during the intervention. Participants across all experimental groups reported an increase in self-efficacy after the intervention, with improved performance on quiz-type questions. However, the novelty and variety of the designs produced by the in-person experimental groups were significantly lower than that of the virtual experimental groups. In addition to validating the effectiveness of virtual instruction as a teaching method, these results also support the authors’ hypothesis that the priming effect is stronger in an in-person classroom than in a virtual classroom. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Design for additive manufacturing; Engineering education; Virtual learning","Additives; Computer aided instruction; Design; E-learning; Engineering education; Virtual reality; Design for additive manufacturing; Design-process; Experimental groups; Face-to-face learning; Learning Activity; Learning environments; Process impact; Student performance; Virtual learning; Virtual learning environments; 3D printers","","","","","","","Adam G.A., Zimmer D., Design for additive manufacturing—element transitions and aggregated structures, CIRP J Manuf Sci Technol, 7, 1, pp. 20-28, (2014); Alghamdi A., Karpinski A.C., Lepp A., Barkley J., Online and face-to-face classroom multitasking and academic performance: moderated mediation with self-efficacy for self-regulated learning and gender, Comput Hum Behav, 102, pp. 214-222, (2020); Allen M., Mabry E., Mettrey M., Bourhis J., Titsworth S., Burrell N., Evaluating the effectiveness of distance learning: a comparison using meta-analysis, J Commun, 54, 3, pp. 402-420, (2004); Bhagwatwar A., Anne M., Dennis A.R., Creative virtual environments: Effect of supraliminal priming on team brainstorming.”, In: 2013 46Th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, pp. 215-224, (2013); Blosch-Paidosh A., Kristina S., Design heuristics for additive manufacturing, Proceedings of the 21St International Conference on Engineering Design (ICED 17), 5, (2017); Browning M.H., Larson L.R., Sharaievska I., Rigolon A., McAnirlin O., Mullenbach L., Cloutier S., Et al., Psychological impacts from COVID-19 among university students: risk factors across seven states in the United States, PLOS ONE, 16, 1, (2021); Clark-Carter D., Doing quantitative psychological research: from design to report, (1997); Deneui D.L., Dodge T.L., Asynchronous learning networks and student outcomes: The utility of online learning components in hybrid courses, J Instr Psychol, 33, 4, pp. 256-259, (2006); Eskinazi M., Giannopulu I., Continuity in Intuition and Insight: from Real to Naturalistic Virtual Environment, Sci Rep, 11, 1, (2021); Fillingim K.B., Nwaeri R.O., Paredis C.J.J., Rosen D., Katherine F., Examining the effect of design for additive manufacturing rule presentation on part redesign quality, J Eng Des, 31, 8-9, pp. 427-460, (2020); Heppen J.B., Kirk W., Margaret C., Faria A.M., Tobey C., Sorensen N., Culp K., Access to algebra I: The effects of online mathematics for grade 8 students, (2012); Heppen J.B., Sorensen N., Allensworth E., Walters K., Rickles J., Taylor S.S., Michelman V., The struggle to pass algebra: online vs. face-to-face credit recovery for at-risk urban students, J Res Educ Effect, 10, 2, pp. 272-296, (2017); Murdock B.B., Bennet B., The serial position effect of free recall, J Exp Psychol, 64, 5, (1962); Kranz J., Herzog D., Emmelmann C., Design guidelines for laser additive manufacturing of lightweight structures in TiAl6V4, J Laser Appl, 27, 1, (2015); Lee S.-Y., Investigating students' learning approaches, perceptions of online discussions, and students' online and academic performance, Comput Educ, 68, pp. 345-352, (2013); Lepp A., Barkley J.E., Karpinski A.C., Singh S., College students’ multitasking behavior in online versus face-to-face courses, SAGE Open, 9, 1, (2019); Lu X., Steven D., Priming effects on safety decisions in a virtual construction simulator, Eng Constr Archit Manag, 25, 2, pp. 273-294, (2018); Madhav K.C., Sherchand S.P., Sherchan S., Association between screen time and depression among US adults, Prev Med Rep, 8, pp. 67-71, (2017); Meade J.A., Parthasarathy K., Did COVID-19 impact student learning in an introductory accounting course?, Bus Educ Innov J, 12, 2, pp. 18-23, (2020); Meyers-Levy J., Zhu R., The influence of ceiling height: the effect of priming on the type of processing that people use, J Consum Res, 34, 2, pp. 174-186, (2007); Paige M.A., Fillingim K.B., Murphy A.R., Song H., Reichling C.J., Katherine F., Examining the effects of mood on quality and feasibility of design outcomes, Int J Des Creat Innov, 9, 2, pp. 79-102, (2021); Pena J., Hancock J.T., Merola N.A., The priming effects of avatars in virtual settings, Commun Res, 36, 6, pp. 838-856, (2009); Prabhu R., Investigating the effect of design for additive manufacturing education on student design processes and creativity.”, School of Engineering Design, Technology, and Professional Programs, (2018); Prabhu R., Scarlett R.M., Timothy W.S., Nicholas A.M., The earlier the better?

In addition to the spread of melanoma in the bloodstream, melanoma-stroma interaction and the lymphatic system play active roles in said heterogeneity and resistance, leading to its progression and metastasis. Reproducing the complexities of the melanoma microenvironment in vitro will help understanding its progression and enhance the translatability of potential cancer therapeutics. A blood-lymphatic integrated system with heterogeneous melanoma spheroids (BLISH) using the in-bath bioprinting process is developed. The process uniformly prints size-controllable metastatic melanoma spheroids along with biomimetic blood and lymphatic vessels (LVs). The system reproduces hallmark events of metastatic melanoma, such as tumor stroma interaction, melanoma invasion, and intravasation. The application of the system to investigate the anticancer effect of combinational targeted therapy suggests that it can be used to study the pathophysiology of melanoma and improve the accuracy of drug response monitoring in skin cancer. © 2022 The Authors.

Manufacturing parts with this technology is nowadays done through 2.5D strategies. This type of strategy consists in cutting a 3D model using planar layers parallel to each other. This 2.5D technique limits the complexity of the geometries that can be produced in WAAM without taking advantage of height deposit modulation. It also requires several start/stop phases of the arc during the transition from one layer to another, which leads to poor quality. This paper presents a new fast and efficient path planning strategy aiming at creating a continuous manufacturing path, thus increasing poor part quality. This strategy so called “Scalar Thermal Field for Continuous Toolpath” is generating a continuous spiral manufacturing toolpath for thin shaped parts. The modulation of deposition, by controlling the welding torch travel speed at constant wire feed rate, allows continuous deposition of material throughout the manufacturing process. The keypoint of the method is the use of a thermal scalar field associated with a 6-axis robotic arm kinematics which allows the manufacturing of closed parts after optimal closure point determination or direct manufacturing of opened parts with non-planar free edges. Validation of the presented method is performed by manufacturing three distinct parts: an opened, a closed part and a multi-branch part. The fabrication of these parts and their precise measurement have shown the reliability and the restitution capacity of our method which is clearly superior to 2.5D strategies nowadays commonly used in WAAM technology. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","5-axis strategy;

The upper body exoskeleton is an example of an assistive rehabilitation device. However, in order to solve its technological problems, interdisciplinary research is still necessary. This paper presents a new three-degrees of freedom (DOF) active upper-body exoskeleton for medical rehabilitation named “SAMA”. Its mechanical structure is inspired by the geometry and biomechanics of the human body, particularly the ranges of motion (ROM) and the needed torque. The SAMA exoskeleton was manufactured and assembled into an ergonomic custom-made wheelchair in a sitting posture in order to provide portability and subject comfort during experimental testing and rehabilitation exercises. Dynamic modeling using MATLAB–Simulink was used for calculating the inverse kinematics, dynamic analysis, trajectory generation and implementation of proportional–integral–derivative (PID) computed torque control (PID-CTC). A new framework has been developed for rapid prototyping (the dynamic modeling, control, and experimentation of SAMA) based on the integration between MATLAB–Simulink and the Robot Operating System (ROS) environment. This framework allows the robust position and torque control of the exoskeleton and real-time monitoring of SAMA and its subject. Two joints of the developed exoskeleton were successfully tested experimentally for the desired arm trajectory. The angular position and torque controller responses were recorded and the exoskeleton joints showed a maximum delay of 200° and a maximum steady state error of 0.25°. These successful results encourage further development and testing for different subjects and more control strategies. © 2022 by the authors.","control framework; dynamic modeling; rehabilitation robotics; Robot Operating System (ROS); upper exoskeletons; wearable robots","","","","","","","","Babaiasl M., Mahdioun S.H., Jaryani P., Yazdani M., A review of technological and clinical aspects of robot-aided rehabilitation of upper-extremity after stroke.

Evaluation of buildability based on fresh material properties and print parameters is of significance. In this paper, the buildability of printable engineered cementitious composites was investigated and quantified at the material and the structural scale. Fresh ECC material showed excellent load capacity and deformation resistance at the material scale, therefore preventing material failure of the bottom layers, as confirmed by constant shear rate tests and incremental loading tests. To predict vertical deformation of a 3DP structure, a time-dependent strain-stress model of printable ECC was proposed and validated based on the green strength evolution of the material and the buildup rate of the designed structure. At the structural scale, the approach of predicting critical height at self-buckling failure based on stiffness evolution was validated by printing a straight wall and a cylinder structure. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3D printing engineered cementitious composites (3DP-ECC); Buildability; Fresh properties; Self-buckling; Time-dependent model","Buckling; Deformation; 3-D printing; 3d printing engineered cementitious composite; 3D-printing; Buildability; Engineered cementitious composites; Fresh properties; Property characterizations; Self-buckling; Time dependent; Time-dependent models; 3D printers","","","","","Center for Low Carbon Built Environment; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Michigan; James R.

The two models are generalized into a specific type of linear interval programming (LIP) and nonlinear interval programming (NLIP), respectively. A security limits method (SLM) is proposed to solve LIP and NLIP problems. As for the LIP, the maximum radii of the interval variables are first calculated by the optimizing-scenarios method (OSM) for defining security limits, and the LIP is transformed into deterministic linear programming (LP), for which its constraints are the security limits, which can be solved by the simplex method. As for the NLIP, Monte Carlo simulations were used to obtain the maximum radii of the interval variables, and the average interval ratio of the interval variables is defined to compute the security limits for transforming the NLIP to deterministic nonlinear programming (NLP), which can be solved by using the interior point method. Finally, the IED and IRPO are used to verify the effectiveness and engineering of the proposed SLM. © 2022 by the authors.","interval uncertainty; linear; nonlinear; security limits method","Electric load dispatching; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Nonlinear programming; Reactive power; Scheduling; Economic Dispatch; Interval programming; Interval uncertainty; Interval variable; Linear; Linear intervals; Load demand; Nonlinear; Reactive power optimization; Security limit method; Linear programming","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52007056); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2020JJ5077); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52007056) and in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China (Grant No. 2020JJ5077).","Abdollahipour A., Sayyaadi H., Optimal Design of a Hybrid Power Generation System Based on Integrating PEM Fuel Cell and PEM Electrolyzer as a Moderator for Micro-Renewable Energy Systems, Energy, 260, (2022); Zhang C., Models and Algorithms of Reactive Power Optimization Considering Uncertainties Based on Interval Theory, Ph.D. Thesis, (2018); Fu X., Statistical Machine Learning Model for Capacitor Planning Considering Uncertainties in Photovoltaic Power, Prot.

By using a combination of experiment and simulation, the residual stress, heat transfer, and mass transfer behaviors are comprehensively studied. Also, microstructure evolution behavior is analyzed. The relationship between the convection behavior, the evolution of microstructure and the enhancement of residual stress induced by LSMMP is established. Compared with the traditional post-treatment process, the LSMMP assisted LAM process exhibits higher efficiency in residual stress control with the same pulsed laser energy input. The hidden mechanism in microstructure evolution and residual stress enhancement is expected to be possible related to intensified molten pool convection, uniform solute distribution and improved cooling rate induced by LSMMP. The hybrid LAM process strategy based on LSMMP provides a new approach for the application of short pulse laser in hybrid manufacturing. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Laser shock; Microstructure; Molten pool; Residual stress","3D printers; Additives; Heat transfer; Iron alloys; Mass transfer; Microstructure; Modulation; Pulsed lasers; Additive manufacturing process; Fe-based alloys; Heat transfer and mass transfers; Hybrid lasers; Laser additive manufacturing; Laser shocks; Manufacturing strategy; Microstructure evolutions; Molten pool; Process-based; Residual stresses","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51901162, U2033211); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51901162 and U2033211 ).

Herein, the concept of jammed microgels designed with a new crosslinking method is introduced to be used in 3D-printing applications. Jammed microgels decorated with superficial hydrophobic segments and pure thermo-sensitive gelatin are applied as inks and exhibit shear-induced transition and fast recoverability, which are important for 3D-printing. The interaction of microgels within the as-extruded filaments and with the adjacent deposited layers guarantees shape-fidelity. After printing, a deep eutectic solvent (DES) formed from Arginine and Glycerol ([DES]Arg/Gly) is applied over the construct to trigger a chemical crosslinking reaction between epoxy and amine groups. The introduced [DES]Arg/Gly can play simultaneously two roles: (1) activator of covalent bond formation and (2) conducting agent. Generally, a variety of features including printability, rheological properties and shape-retention are dependent on the fraction of hydrophobic segments and the applied [DES]Arg/Gly concentration. Further, the main network percolation reaction follows a different strategy to achieve a sustainable printable system with biological, mechanical and physiological sustainability of the construct. These results open new possibilities to fabricate a wide range of adaptive platforms of smart materials with ease. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Conductivity; Crosslinking; Deep eutectic solvent; Jammed microgels","3D printers; Amino acids; Chemical bonds; Eutectics; Gels; Hydrophobicity; Intelligent materials; Solvents; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Additive manufacturing technology; Conductivity; Deep eutectic solvents; Fabrication process; Hydrophobic segment; Jammed microgel; Microgel; Printing applications; Crosslinking","","","","","Iran National Science Foundation, INSF, (99026593); Office of Vice Chancellor for Research and Technology, University of Isfahan","Appreciation is extended to the Office of Vice Chancellor for Research and Technology of University of Isfahan , Iran; and Iran National Science Foundation , Iran for financial supporting of this work (No. 99026593 ).

However, fabricating such an ordered array of gradient micro/nanowires with controllable diameters and compositions is still a great challenge to most of the current methods. Here, meniscus-confined electrodeposition (MCED) technique is adopted for the rapid prototyping of the shape-gradient magnetic Cu/Co-alloy microwire arrays by adjusting the printing speed continuously, which provides a novel idea for the preparation and performance research of shape-gradient magnetic alloy microwire arrays with well-defined structures. It is found that the key to fabricating controllable gradient alloy micro/nano structures by increasing the printing speed is to continuously stretch the meniscus within the stable range of the meniscus. In the range of incremental speed in this study, the shape-gradient magnetic alloy wires with stable and uniform compositions and dense internal structures can be successfully prepared, and the gradient ratio can be adjusted from 0 to about 0.025. Compared with the uniform-diameter array, the shape-gradient magnetic alloy array shows an improvement in remanence and coercive force. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","additive micromanufacturing; Cu/Co microwire arrays; magnetization; shape-gradient","Copper alloys; Electrodeposition; Remanence; Additive micromanufacturing; Cu/co microwire array; Direct-writing; Electrodeposition process; Magnetic alloy; Micro-manufacturing; Microwire array; Nanowires (array); Printing speed; Shape gradient; Electrodes","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11574331); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Ningbo Municipal Bureau of Science and Technology, (2020Z049); Ningbo Municipal Bureau of Science and Technology","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 11574331), and the Ningbo Science & Technology Bureau (Grant No. 2020Z049).

However, its insufficient manufacturing precision impedes a wide application of this process. In order to improve the geometric accuracy of beads deposited by WAAM, a feedback control system based on the multiple model approach is developed. Different local models are identified to characterize the complex dynamics between the process parameter travel speed and the bead geometry. The developed control system is tested in the manufacturing of three different parts with variable geometry. It is demonstrated that the system effectively compensates for geometric errors (both width and height), and the three tested parts’ mean error is reduced by 78%. The system can also increase the productivity of deposition by avoiding requirements of low interlayer temperatures. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Bead geometry;

However, the existing spatial light modulators (SLM) are insufficient for large-scale holographic display. In this research, a large-scale holographic 3D display system, which consists of a laser, a beam expander, three lenses, a beam splitter, two SLMs, and an aperture stop is proposed. First, a large-scale hologram is generated using the error diffusion method. Then, the large-scale hologram is divided into two holograms with the same resolution, and loaded onto two SLMs, respectively. Finally, the diffraction light fields of the two SLMs are seamlessly spliced together in space to realize large-scale holographic 3D display. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the system. © 2022 Universitat zu Koln.

A metal-only right-hand CP (RHCP) antenna is designed and used as the reflectarray's phase-shifting unit cell (UC). The RHCP UC is immune to the LHCP incidence, and the UC directly reflects the LHCP incidence into free space. Thus, the phase shifting of the LHCP wave solely depends on the rotation angle of the UC. For the RHCP incidence, it is received by the RHCP UC first and induced into the metal waveguide. Then, the energy is reflected by the ground of the metal waveguide and reradiated into free space with RHCP. Thus, the phase shifting of the RHCP wave is determined by the rotation angle of the UC and the length of the metal waveguide. By properly selecting the rotation angle of the UC and the length of the metal waveguide, RHCP and LHCP can be independently manipulated. To demonstrate, two reflectarray antennas with different LHCP and RHCP beam directions are fabricated using additive manufacturing and experimentally verified.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Additive manufacturing; circular polarization; metal-only; reflectarray","3D printers; Antenna arrays; Antenna reflectors; Circular polarization; Microwave antennas; Millimeter waves; Reflection; Scattering parameters; Surface waves; Uranium compounds; Circularly-polarized; Dual circularly polarized; Metal waveguides; Metal-only; Phase-shifting; Reflectarrays; Reflector antennas; Rotation angles; Three-dimensional-printing; Unit cells; Metals","","","","","Guangdong Province Natural Science Outstanding Youth Fund Project, (2021B1515020039)","This work was supported by the Guangdong Province Natural Science Outstanding Youth Fund Project under Grant 2021B1515020039.","Nayeri P., Yang F., Elsherbeni A.Z., Reflectarray Antennas: Theory, Designs, and Applications., (2018); Florencio R., Encinar J.A., Boix R.R., Losada V., Toso G., Reflectarray antennas for dual polarization and broadband telecom satellite applications, IEEE Trans.

Additive Manufacturing (AM) pushes design freedom to previously unachievable limits. AM allows the manufacturing of lattice structures which are otherwise close to impossible to be manufactured conventionally. Yet, the geometric modelling of heterogeneous lattice structures is still greatly limited. Thus, the AM industry is now in a situation where the manufacturing capabilities exceed the geometric modelling capabilities. While there have been advancements in the modelling of heterogeneous lattice structures, the review of relevant literature revealed critical limitations of the existing approaches. These limitations include their inability to model non-linear variation of geometric parameters, as well as the limited amount of controllable geometric parameters. This work presents a novel geometric modelling methodology based on function representation as an attempt to bridge this gap. The proposed approach avoids the manual definition of geometric parameters and provides a method to control them with mathematical functions instead. A software prototype implementing the proposed approach is presented, and several use-cases are analysed.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Finite element models were firstly validated against experimental test results in terms of the failure mode and load–deflection relationship. Then validated models were used to carry out the parametric investigation. The dowel bar diameter, the stainless steel ring length as well as the stainless steel ring thickness were studied with 90 generated models. According to the finite element analysis results, it was found that the vertical stiffness and ultimate load were enhanced with the increase of the dowel bar diameter. And the application of the stainless steel ring significantly relieved the compressive stress concentration at joint surface due to the expanded contact area. Close relationships were then observed between the ultimate load and the stainless steel ring thickness and length, respectively. Empirical equations were also derived to predict the ultimate load under the ultimate limit state (ULS). Meanwhile, under 20 kN service limit state (SLS), a close relationship was also found between the maximum compressive stress of concrete and the external diameter of the stainless steel ring. Through this two-stage design, the stainless steel ring strengthened removable dowel bar connection system will be more durable and reliable. © 2022 Institution of Structural Engineers","Design recommendations; Dowel bar diameter; Removable dowel bar connection system; Stainless steel ring length; Stainless steel ring thickness","","","","","","Industrial Center at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局, (R5007-18); Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU","The research work presented in this paper was supported by a grant from the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China (Project no.

The effect of varying nanoparticle concentrations on the structural and thermal properties was examined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Subsequently, the magnetic field with various intensities was generated using a vibrating sample magnetometer in a controlled environment. The resulting deformation rate of the nanocomposites was observed in response to changing magnetic fields. The results revealed that the PLA/α-Fe2O3 nanocomposites could be potential materials for biomedical applications, i.e., cardiovascular stents, which can provide the desired stimulus to treat post-stenting complications without the need for secondary surgical procedures. In future studies, the synthesized PLA/α-Fe2O3 nanocomposites will be adopted for 3D printing (3DP) processes to develop patient-specific cardiovascular stents and to evaluate their biomechanical performance. © 2022 The Author(s)","Biomaterials; Functionalization; Hematite (α-Fe<sub>2</sub>o<sub>3</sub>); Magnetic hysteresis; Magnetic nanocomposites","","","","","","","","Shameli K., Bin A.M., Zamanian A., Sangpour P., Shabanzadeh P., Abdollahi Y., Et al., Green biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using Curcuma longa tuber powder, Int.

Lattices are composed of axial elements called ligaments: Several unit cells are repeated in three directions to form bodies. However, their inherent structure complexity leads to several problems when lattices need to be designed or numerically simulated. The computational power needed to capture the overall component is extremely high. For this reason, some alternative methodologies called homogenization methods were developed in the literature. However, following these approaches, the designers do not have a local visual overview of the lattice behavior, especially at the ligament level. For this reason, an alternative mono-dimensional (1D) modeling approach, called lattice-to-1D is proposed in this work. This method approximates the ligament element with its beam axis, uses the real material characteristics, and gives the cross-sectional information directly to the solver. Several linear elastic simulations, involving both stretching and bending dominated unit cells, are performed to compare this approach with other alternatives in the literature. The results show a comparable agreement of the 1D simulations compared with homogenization methods for real tridimensional (3D) objects, with a dramatic decrease of computational power needed for a 3D analysis of the whole body.  © 2022 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","homogenization; lattice structure; periodic structure; structural analysis; voxel","Homogenization method; Periodic structures; Additive manufacturing technology; Cell-be; Cell/B.E; Cell/BE; Computational power; Homogenization; Lattice structures; Structure complexity; Unit cells; Voxel; Structural analysis","","","","","","","Gibson I, Rosen D., Stucker B., Additive Manufacturing Technologies, (2015); Bacciaglia A, Ceruti A, Liverani A., Additive manufactur ing challenges and future developments in the next ten years, Design Tools and Methods in Industrial Engineering.

In this paper, a magneto-structural topology optimization method is proposed considering AM constraints to improve the design manufacturability of optimized designs. The design problem is formulated with the weighted combination of magnetic compliance and mechanical compliance as a single objective subjected to two types of manufacturing constraints and the volume fraction constraint. Two important AM constraints are in a sequential manner incorporated into the topology optimization model, in which the overhang angle constraint is followed by the maximum length scale constraint. Corresponding sensitivities of the objective and constraints are derived, and the optimization problem is solved by the method of moving asymptotes. Two numerical examples and a practical conceptual design of linear motor rotor structure are systematically investigated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.  © 2022 The Author(s).

In this study, a hybrid manufacturing (HM) technique that combines a directed energy deposition (DED)-type additive manufacturing (AM) fabrication process with milling-type machining is investigated. In the DED process examined, Inconel 718 (IN718) and stainless steel 316L (SS316L) metal powders were blown into the molten pool at different and varying respective flow rates to achieve specific composition ratios for different printed layers so that a smooth gradient transition from SS316L to IN718 was achieved. Due to the attendant generation of rough surfaces common to such FGMs, partition milling was employed after fabrication, and the cutting temperatures and forces were simultaneously recorded considering the significant anisotropy in mechanical properties. The surface roughness of each FGM gradient section and tool wear mechanism were also measured after machining. Through analysis of the experimental results, the machining mechanism was revealed, which provides new insights into the machinability of SS316L/IN718 FGMs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Directed energy deposition;

Organic farming systems cannot make use of synthetic fertilizers and therefore rely on several cultural techniques to maintain vigorous young trees and for quick shoot development, satisfactory yield, and fruit quality. We studied the effect of three different organic products (Terra Insecta® (Aeiphoria-Sustainable products of Crete, Chania, Greece), Fruit-Fix®, and AMINO-16® (both products manufactured by EVYP, Sindos, Thessaloniki, Greece) on avocado plants in the cool subtropical area of southern Greece. Three experiments were carried out, two of them on young avocado trees, and the third one on mature, fully productive trees. The establishment success (ES) (%), plants with shoot induction (SI) (%), plants with shoot growth ≥ 3 cm (SG) (%), number of sprouted buds ≥3 cm per plant (SB), mean shoot length (cm) per plant (SL), total shoot length (cm) per plant (TSL), mean leaf number per plant (LN), and total leaf number per plant (TLN) were measured in the first and second experiments, while in the third experiment, fruit growth parameters (length, width, fruit weight, fruit weight increase (FWI)) and fruit quality parameters (dry matter, oil concentration, dry matter, and oil concentration increase) were measured. The application of 0.2 K of Terra Insecta® to the planting hole did not have any statistically significant effect on plant growth, but when added around the trunk, statistically higher values were observed for SB, SL, LN, TSL, and TLN in the Terra Insecta® treatment compared to the control. Fruit-Fix® application to Lamb Hass avocado trees resulted in significant differences in ES, SI, SG, SL, TSL, LN, and TLN, and in the Hass variety, in SB. In the AMINO-16® experiment, the fruit dimensions, quality parameters, and yield of the Hass variety were not recorded as significantly different. However, in the Fuerte variety, FW increased by 119.3% in the AMINO-16® treatment. The effect of the organic fertilizers used in this research showed noticeable results requiring studies to be carried out over more seasons, different tree ages, cultivation methods, and stress conditions. © 2022 by the authors.","amino-acid fertilizer; Ascophyllum nodosum; avocado; insect manure; Mediterranean; organic fertilizer","organic farming; tree","","","","","","","Sommaruga R., Eldridge H.M., Avocado Production: Water Footprint and Socio-Economic Implications, EuroChoices, 20, pp. 48-53, (2021); The European Market Potential for Avocados, (2021); Grandi S., Retail marketing trends: Dallo shopper marketing al vertical branding, Retail Marketing Trends, pp. 1-245, (2017); Migliore G., Farina V., Tinervia S., Matranga G., Schifani G., Consumer Interest towards Tropical Fruit: Factors Affecting Avocado Fruit Consumption in Italy, Agric.

Usually, the excessive settlement caused by tunnelling during the construction process damages the adjacent infrastructures and utilities, especially if the tunnel is excavated by the new Austrian tunnelling method (NATM). Thus, it is important to make accurate predictions and effective control on tunnelling-induced settlement. In this study, the soil’s Young’s modulus was modelled using a three-dimensional random field and coupled with a finite difference method (FDM) analysis to reveal the scale of fluctuations (SOF) effects on the maximum surface settlement (Smax). The Fourier series method is employed to generate the field of Young’s modulus for soil, and sensitivity studies are further performed via Monte-Carlo simulations (MCS). The results demonstrate that the mean value of Smax increased from 28 to 31 mm and its coefficient of variation (COV) increased from 0.02 to 0.35, with an increasing horizontal SOF but both stabilize at higher values of SOF. Furthermore, the probability of failure increases as the COV increases for each allowable limit greater than the verification FDM of Smax. It is observed that ignoring the spatial variability of the soil properties leads to an underestimate of excessive surface settlement risk. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","NATM tunnel; Random field; Scale of fluctuations; Spatial variability; Surface settlement","Fourier series; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Settlement of structures; Soils; Tunneling (excavation); Tunnels; Case-studies; Coefficients of variations; New austrian tunneling method tunnel; New Austrian tunnelling method; Probabilistic analysis; Random fields; Scale of fluctuation; Spatial variability; Spatial variability of soil properties; Surface settlements; construction; probability; soil property; spatial variation; tunnel; tunneling; Young modulus; Finite difference method","","","","","","","Alebouyeh A., Dehghan A., Goshtasbi K., Identifying the geological hazards during mechanized tunnelling in urban areas—the case of Tehran alluvium conditions, Tunnels and underground cities: engineering and innovation meet archaeology, architecture and art, pp. 5264-5274, (2019); Baginska I., Kawa M., Janecki W., Estimation of spatial variability of lignite mine dumping ground soil properties using CPTu results, Studia Geotechnica Et Mechanica, 38, pp. 3-13, (2016); Baginska I., Kawa M., Janecki W., Estimation of spatial variability properties of mine waste dump using CPTu results—case study, Cone Penetr Test., pp. 109-115, (2018); Cheng H., Chen J., Chen R., Chen G., Comparison of modelling soil parameters using random variables and random fields in reliability analysis of tunnel face, Int J Geomech, 19, (2019); Cheng H., Chen J., Li J., Probabilistic analysis of ground movements caused by tunneling in a spatially variable soil, Int J Geomech, 19, (2019); Cherubini C., Data and considerations on the variability of geotechnical properties of soils, Proceedings of the Conference on Advances in Safety and Reliability, ESREL, pp. 1583-1591, (1997); Dasaka S., Zhang L., Spatial variability of in situ weathered soil, Géotechnique, 62, pp. 375-384, (2012); Dehghan A.N., Influence of forepoling umbrella on the settlements induced by shallow urban tunnelling, Geotech Geol Eng, 38, pp. 5005-5022, (2020); Dehghan A.N., Shafiee S.M., Rezaei F., 3-D stability analysis and design of the primary support of Karaj metro tunnel: based on convergence data and back analysis algorithm, Eng Geol, 141, pp. 141-149, (2012); Dehghan A.N., Bagheri E., Khodaei M., Kalehsar R.I., Evaluating the effect of EPBM operational parameters on surface settlement in soft ground, J Geophys Eng, 18, pp. 47-61, (2021); Fenton G.A., Griffiths D., Probabilistic foundation settlement on spatially random soil, J Geotech Geoenviron Eng, 128, pp. 381-390, (2002); Fenton G.A., Griffiths D., Bearing-capacity prediction of spatially random c φ soils, Can Geotech J, 40, pp. 54-65, (2003); Fenton G.A., Griffiths D., Three-dimensional probabilistic foundation settlement, J Geotech Geoenviron Eng, 131, pp. 232-239, (2005); Gong W., Luo Z., Juang C.H., Huang H., Zhang J., Wang L., Optimization of site exploration program for improved prediction of tunnelling-induced ground settlement in clays, Comput Geotech, 56, pp. 69-79, (2014); Griffiths D., Fenton G.A., Bearing capacity of spatially random soil: the undrained clay Prandtl problem revisited, Geotechnique, 51, pp. 351-359, (2001); Griffiths D.V., Fenton G., Risk assessment in geotechnical engineering, pp. 381-400, (2008); Griffiths D., Fenton G.A., Manoharan N., Undrained bearing capacity of two-strip footings on spatially random soil, Int J Geomech, 6, pp. 421-427, (2006); Gui M.-W., Chen S.-L., Estimation of transverse ground surface settlement induced by DOT shield tunnelling, Tunn Undergr Space Technol, 33, pp. 119-130, (2013); He B.-G., Zhang X.-W., Li H.-P., Ground load on tunnels built using new Austrian tunnelling method: the study of a tunnel passing through highly weathered sandstone, Bull Eng Geol Environ, 78, pp. 6221-6234, (2019); Huang J., Lyamin A., Griffiths D., Krabbenhoft K., Sloan S., Quantitative risk assessment of landslide by limit analysis and random fields, Comput Geotech, 53, pp. 60-67, (2013); Jaksa M.B., Brooker P.I., Kaggwa W.S., Inaccuracies associated with estimating random measurement errors, J Geotech Geoenviron Eng, 123, pp. 393-401, (1997); Jaky J., Pressure in silos, .

This work reports a promising method to fabricate geometrically complex ceramic composite components with exceptional damage tolerance by exploiting additive manufacturing (AM) and novel biomimetic toughening design. As-fabricated ceramic composites avoid catastrophic failure and exhibit remarkable improvements in toughness (≈116 times) comparable to those of pure ceramics, and possess customized geometries that cannot be created by conventional method. Such bioinspired ceramic composites processed by AM create exciting opportunities for the customization applications, such as dental restorations, which are demonstrated in this work. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Ceramic composites; Toughness","Additives; Chemical stability; Mechanical stability; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Catastrophic failures; Ceramic composites; Composite components; Conventional methods; Current processing; Customisation; Damage tolerant; Processing strategies; 3D printers","","","","","Guangdong Province International Collaboration Programme, (2019A050510003); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, (20200925155544005, GJHZ20200731095606021, HZQB-KCZYB-2020083, KQTD20190929172505711); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality","The authors acknowledge the assistance of SUSTech Core Research Facilities.

In this study, the optical imaging of mesh structures not coated and coated with platinum was performed to analyze the optical characteristics of the lattices. A nickel monolith catalyst was manufactured via additive manufacturing and coated with platinum, and it was presented to characterize the catalyst properties. The analysis focused on the process of coating using hydrazine bath as a reducing agent. The results showed an increase in the thickness of the coating with baths with durations of 1.5 h, 2.0 h and 2.5 h. The coating thickness was strongly dependent on time duration. The SEM images and EDX were used to confirm the process of coating and analyze the presence of platinum on the catalyst. Coating layers were very thin, and others were not homogeneous over the surface. When the catalyst was exposed to platinum for 2.5 h, the catalyst showed an efficiency of 0.06% for NOx, 0.10%, for CO and 0.09% for HC reduction. © 2022 by the authors.","CO; compression ignition engine; HC emissions; nickel; NOx; platinum catalyst; platinum coating; SEM and EDX images analyses","3D printers; Catalysts; Fuel additives; Image analysis; Nitrogen oxides; Platinum; CO; Compression ignition engine; HC emissions; Image analyze; NOx; Platinum catalysts; Platinum coating; SEM and EDX image analyze; Structure characterization; ]+ catalyst; Thickness measurement","","","","","","","Dec J., Sjoberg M., A Parametric Study of HCCI Combustion-The Sources of Emissions at Low Loads and the Effects of GDI Fuel Injection, (2003); Dec J., Sjoberg M., Hwang W., Davisson M., Leif R.N., Detailed HCCI exhaust € speciation and the sources of hydrocarbon and oxygenated hydrocarbon emissions, SAE Int.

This paper proposes a hardware workflow developed for the Long-Term Evolution (LTE) communication system. It studies the multiple-input, multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) LTE system. Specifically, this work focuses on the implementation of the OFDM block that dominates the execution time in high-speed communication systems. To achieve this goal, we have proposed an NoC-based low-latency OFDM LTE multicore system that leverages Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) parallel computation on a variable number of processing cores. The proposed multicore system is implemented on an FPGA platform using the ProNoC tool, an automated rapid prototyping platform. Our obtained results show that LTE OFDM execution time is drastically reduced by increasing the number of processing cores. Nevertheless, the NoC’s parameters, such as routing algorithm and topology, have a negligible influence on the overall execution time. The implementation results show up to 24% and 76% execution time reduction for a system having 2 and 16 processing cores compared to conventional LTE OFDM implemented in a single-core, respectively. We have found that a 4×4 Mesh NoC with XY deterministic routing connected to 16 processing tiles computing IFFT task is the most efficient configuration for computing LTE OFDM. This configuration is 4.12 times faster than a conventional system running on a single-core processor. © 2021, Institut Mines-Télécom and Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Inverse fast fourier transform (IFFT); Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO); Network-on-chip (NoC); Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","Fast Fourier transforms; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Long Term Evolution (LTE); MIMO systems; Network-on-chip; Scattering parameters; Inverse fast fourier transform; Inverse fast Fourier transforms; Long-term evolution; Multiple inputs; Multiple outputs; Multiple-input multiple-output; Network-on-chip; Networks on chips; Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","","","","","","","Hsieh H.C., Chen J.L., Benslimane A., 5G virtualized multi-access edge computing platform for IoT applications, J Netw Comput Appl, 115, pp. 94-102, (2018); Younus M.U., ul Islam S., Ali I., Khan S., Khan M.K., A survey on software defined networking enabled smart buildings: architecture, challenges and use cases, J Netw Comput Appl, 137, pp. 62-77, (2019); Liu S., Huang S., Li M., Dong X., Qiu D., Yang R., Novel low-complexity low-latency orthogonal frequency division multiplexing transmitter, Wuhan Univ J Nat Sci, 24, 1, pp. 71-78, (2019); Lasorte N., Barnes W.J., Refai H.H., The history of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, IEEE GLOBECOM 2008-2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference.

Compared to conventional manufacturing systems, DDM systems are not as common and incorporate several distinctive features, such as higher flexibility in product form and structure, lower economies of scale and higher potential for decentralized production network. The initial design phase of a DDM production system, where very important in term of efficiency and quality, decisions are made, is a relatively unexplored topic in the relevant literature. In the present study, the corresponding issues are investigated through a case study involving the direct digital production of a customized reusable face mask (respirator) for medical use. Investigated system design aspects include product, process, and facility design. Based on data generated through manufacturing tests, a preliminary cost analysis is performed and several scenarios regarding production throughput and facility planning are examined. According to the results, DDM of custom-made face masks is, to a large extent, technically and economically feasible. Interestingly, considering the whole process, a large part of production cost is associated with labor and materials. Finally, evidence for a fundamental trade-off between manufacturing cost and speed/flexibility is identified, implying that different implementations of DDM systems can be realized depending on strategic operational objectives. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing; additive manufacturing; direct digital manufacturing; material jetting; product customization; respirator; reusable face mask","","","","","","","","Levy G.N., Schindel R., Kruth J.P., Rapid manufacturing and rapid tooling with layer manufacturing (LM) technologies, state of the art and future perspectives, CIRP Ann, 52, pp. 589-609, (2003); Gibson I., Rosen D., Stucker B., Development of Additive Manufacturing Technology, Additive Manufacturing Technologies, pp. 19-42, (2015); Chen D., Heyer S., Ibbotson S., Salonitis K., Steingrimsson J.G., Thiede S., Direct digital manufacturing: Definition, evolution, and sustainability implications, J.

The bonding mechanism of metallic glass particles was systematically investigated through studying the deformation behavior of individual particles after deposition. We revealed two collective particle bonding mechanisms that contributed to the formation of metallic glass deposits, i.e., high-velocity impact induced localized metallurgical bonding at the fringe of the interface, and high particle temperature induced viscosity reduction and the resultant annular metallurgical bonding band. Moreover, the dynamic evolution mechanism of the amorphous phase into nanocrystal structures at severely deformed interfacial regions during cold spray was carefully investigated. For the first time, we observed different amorphous/nanocrystal structures in cold sprayed metallic glass deposits, which can represent different evolution stages in nanocrystallization process. Based on the observation, it is inferred that the nanocrystallization process can be divided into following three stages: composition segregation, the formation of ordered 1D and 2D transition structures, and 3D nanocrystals. The current study provides new insights into the bonding mechanisms and the mechanistic nanocrystallization origins in cold sprayed bulk metallic glass deposits. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Bonding mechanism; Bulk metallic glass (BMG); Cold spray; Nanocrystallization","3D printers; Additives; Glass; Metallic glass; Metals; Nanocrystals; (metallic) glass; Bonding mechanism; Bulk metallic glass; Cold spray; Cold-sprayed; Metallurgical bonding; Nano-crystallization process; Nanocrystal structures; Nanocrystallisation; Deposits","","","","","UMass Amherst Faculty Startup Fund; National Science Foundation, NSF, (CMMI-1927621); National Science Foundation, NSF; Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung, AvH; Trinity College Dublin, TCD; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52061160483); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201906460020); China Scholarship Council, CSC; State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing, SKLSP, (SKLSP202011); State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing, SKLSP","Funding text 1: Mr. Ningsong Fan and Dr. Shuo Yin would like to acknowledge the financial support from the China Scholarship Council (CSC) – Trinity College Dublin Joint Scholarship Programme (No. 201906460020 ) and the fund from the State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing of China ( SKLSP202011 ).

However, further research is needed to overcome the many challenges facing AM, especially in the mixed-mode fracture. The results presented in this paper are framing the experimental data obtained for mixed-mode I/II fracture properties of laser sintered polyamide. The experiment was carried out on Semi-Circular Bend (SCB) specimens manufactured from polyamide PA2200 using EOS Formiga P100 laser sintering machine. To achieve the full range of fracture toughness values, from pure mode I to pure mode II, five crack orientations of the SCB specimens (0, 15, 30, 45 and 54°) were considered. Further, crack initiation angle and crack paths of SCB specimens have been assessed in order to identify the fracture phenomena (interlayer and/or intralayer fracture). The main fracture properties (fracture toughness, crack initiation angles and crack paths) were compared with the theoretical predictions of three mixed-mode fracture criteria (Maximum Tensile Stress-MTS, Maximum Energy Release Rate-Gmax and Equivalent Stress Intensity Factor-ESIF). The results underline differences between theoretical approaches and experimental data, especially due to the interlayer fracture phenomenon. However, it was obtained that the Gmax and ESIF criteria show the best match with the experimental data. © 2022 The Authors","Crack paths; Fracture criteria; Fracture toughness; Laser-sintered polyamide; mixed-mode I/II fracture","Crack initiation; Laser heating; Sintering; Bend specimens; Crack initiation angles; Crack paths; Fracture criterion; Fracture property; Laser sintered; Laser-sintered polyamide; Mixed mode; Mixed mode fracture; Mixed-mode I/II fracture; Fracture toughness","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Horizon 2020, (857124)","Funding text 1: This research was partially funded by research grant from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 857124.; Funding text 2: This research was partially funded by research grant from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 857124.","Khosravani M.R., Soltani P., Reinicke T., Fracture and structural performance of adhesively bonded 3D-printed PETG single lap joints under different printing parameters, Theor.

They are used to reinforce overhanging regions of the desired structure and/or to facilitate the mitigation of residual thermal stresses due to the extreme heat flux produced by the source term (laser beam). Very often, supports are, on purpose, weakly connected to the built structure for easing their removal. In this work, we consider an imperfect interface model for which the interaction between supports and the built structure is not ideal, meaning that the displacement is discontinuous at the interface while the normal stress is continuous and proportional to the jump of the displacement. The optimization process is based on the level set method, body-fitted meshes and the notion of shape derivative using the adjoint method. We provide 2-d and 3-d numerical examples, as well as a comparison with the usual perfect interface model. Completely different designs of supports are obtained with perfect or imperfect interfaces. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Imperfect interface; Interfacial rigidity; Level set method; Support optimization; Topology optimization","3D printers; Additives; Drop breakup; Heat flux; Laser beams; Level measurement; Numerical methods; Topology; Additive manufacturing technology; Building process; Imperfect bondings; Imperfect interface; Interface modeling; Interfacial rigidity; Level Set method; Residual thermal stress; Support optimizations; Topology optimisation; Shape optimization","","","","","Bpifrance","This work was supported by the SOFIA project, funded by the BPI (Banque Publique d’Investissement).

The approach is based on the theory of repeatedly superimposed finite strains. The problem statement is formulated within the framework of nonlinear thermoelasticity. The method of problem solving is developed on the base of finite and spectral element methods. The numerical modeling of a full-sized experiment is performed. In this experiment, the additive manufactured part is notched in order to estimate residual stresses in it. The obtained numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results. It is concluded from the results that the developed approach is correct and the nonlinear effects are substantial. © The Author(s) 2022.","Additive manufacturing; nonlinear thermoelasticity; residual stress; spectral element method; stress analysis; superimposed finite strains","3D printers; Additives; Elasticity; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Residual stresses; Thermoelasticity; Finite strain; Manufacturing IS; Manufacturing products; Non-linear thermoelasticity; Powder bed; Problem statement; Residual stress analysis; Spectral element method; Stresses analysis; Superimposed finite strain; Stress analysis","","","","","Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka, (075-15-2019-1621); Moscow State University of Geodesy and Cartography, MIIGAiK; Council on grants of the President of the Russian Federation, (MD-208.2021.1.1); Lomonosov Moscow State University, MSU","Funding text 1: The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research was performed in Lomonosov Moscow State University and was supported by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation as part of the program of the Mathematical Center for Fundamental and Applied Mathematics under the agreement No. 075-15-2019-1621 (Sections 1-3) and by the grant of the President of the Russian Federation for young scientists—doctors of sciences MD-208.2021.1.1 (Sections 4-6).; Funding text 2: The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research was performed in Lomonosov Moscow State University and was supported by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation as part of the program of the Mathematical Center for Fundamental and Applied Mathematics under the agreement No. 075-15-2019-1621 (Sections 1-3) and by the grant of the President of the Russian Federation for young scientists—doctors of sciences MD-208.2021.1.1 (Sections 4-6).

A major challenge in liver tissue engineering is to mimic the tissue-level complexity: besides the selection of suitable biomaterial(s) replacing the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell sources, the three-dimensional (3D) microarchitecture defined by the fabrication method is a critical factor to achieve functional constructs. In this study, coaxial extrusion-based 3D bioprinting has been applied to develop a liver sinusoid-like model that consists of a core compartment containing pre-vascular structures and a shell compartment containing hepatocytes. The shell ink was composed of alginate and methylcellulose (algMC), dissolved in human fresh frozen plasma. The algMC blend conferred high printing fidelity and stability to the core-shell constructs and the plasma as biologically active component enhanced viability and supported cluster formation and biomarker expression of HepG2 embedded in the shell. For the core, a natural ECM-like ink based on angiogenesis-supporting collagen-fibrin (CF) matrices was developed; the addition of gelatin (G) enabled 3D printing in combination with the plasma-algMC shell ink. Human endothelial cells, laden in the CFG core ink together with human fibroblasts as supportive cells, formed a pre-vascular network in the core in the absence and presence of HepG2 in the shell. The cellular interactions occurring in the triple culture model enhanced the albumin secretion. In conclusion, core-shell bioprinting was shown to be a valuable tool to study cell-cell-interactions and to develop complex tissue-like models.  © 2022 The Author(s).

This work proposes a novel mathematical method that sequentially solves two subproblems, namely the topology and part decomposition problem, to obtain the optimal material layout and partitioning of large-scale structures into additively manufacturable components. Presented as decomposition optimization, the latter subproblem adopts a feature-mapping approach to introduce and optimize the layout of partitioning profiles, referred to as partitioning rectangles, in the design domain. The size of components, thickness, and material properties of component interfaces are directly introduced in the problem formulation through the geometric description of a partitioning rectangle. Further, to ensure each component in the structure is additively manufacturable, an incomplete decomposition fraction constraint is introduced to limit the amount of structural material that exists outside of a partitioning rectangle. The proposed methodology is tested with two numerical examples to demonstrate its capabilities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Additive manufacturing size limitation; Decomposition optimization; Feature-mapping methods; Manufacturability; Topology optimization","3D printers; Additives; Geometry; Mapping; Topology; Additive manufacturing size limitation; Decomposition optimization; Feature mapping; Feature-mapping method; Manufacturability; Mapping method; Optimisations; Optimized structures; Sub-problems; Topology optimisation; Shape optimization","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","This research was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).

In this way, components can be produced with materials adapted to the load case. For this paper, hybrid shafts are produced by deposition welding of a cladding made of X45CrSi9-3 onto a workpiece made from 20MnCr5. The hybrid shafts are then formed by means of cross-wedge rolling. It is investigated, how the thickness of the cladding and the type of cooling after hot forming (in air or in water) affect the properties of the cladding. The hybrid shafts are formed without layer separation. However, slight core loosening occurres in the area of the bearing seat due to the Mannesmann effect. The microhardness of the cladding is only slightly effected by the cooling strategy, while the microhardness of the base material is significantly higher in water cooled shafts. The microstructure of the cladding after both cooling strategies consists mainly of martensite. In the base material, air cooling results in a mainly ferritic microstructure with grains of ferrite-pearlite.

However, due to the solid immiscibility between copper (Cu) and steel (St), it is hard to obtain desired interfacial bonding when using conventional fabrication processes, like rolling and explosive welding. In this work, Cu-St bimetallic sheets were fabricated by friction stir additive manufacturing (FSAM). Microstructural studies show that the wave-like interface with desirable joining was created between copper and steel. Mechanical tests present that the tensile strength and shear strengths are 435 MPa and 345 MPa, respectively. Such properties are remarkably better than that of other methods. Finally, the microstructure evolution and the relationship between microstructure and mechanical properties were discussed. These findings provide an effective way to regulate the interface engineering of bimetallic sheets. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Copper-steel bimetallic sheets; Friction stir additive manufacturing; Mechanical properties","3D printers; Additives; Friction; Friction stir welding; Tensile strength; Best choice; Bimetallics; Copper cu; Copper steel; Copper-steel bimetallic sheet; Friction stir; Friction stir additive manufacturing; Interfacial bonding; Microstructure and properties; Plasma-facing components; Microstructure","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (NSF 51505321); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","The present work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant NSF 51505321 ).

Improving cladding performance by materials and process parameters is the leading research direction, but defects and instability of quality in the cladding process are inevitable. Therefore, it is necessary to study which factors are related to quality. In this paper, a new detection method is proposed to measure the radiation intensity of the reflected laser, laser scanning displacement, and temperature of the substrate while cladding. The characteristic values corresponding to the position of the cladding spots are extracted, the cladding quality is preliminarily evaluated and graded, and the correlation between them is verified with the method of machine learning nu-SVM. The results show that the accuracy of the model trained by 300 groups of data to predict the quality grades is 78.74%, which indicates that there is a strong correlation between these process variables and the cladding quality, and this method is feasible for the quality evaluation and control of the cladding process. © 2022 by the authors.","laser cladding; quality detection; radiation intensity; SVM; test system","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51905148, 52175237); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (B200202218)","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.51905148 and No. 52175237) and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. B200202218).","Qiao X., Xia T., Chen P., Numerical research on effect of overlap ratio on thermal-stress behaviors of the high-speed laser cladding coating, Chin.

In this work, an efficient one-step process to manufacture solid polymer electrolytes composed of nanoscale ion-conducting channels embedded in a rigid crosslinked polymer matrix via Digital Light Processing 3D printing is reported. A visible-light-mediated polymerization-induced microphase-separation approach is utilized, which produces materials with two chemically independent nanoscale domains with highly tunable nanoarchitectures. By producing materials containing a poly(ethylene oxide) domain swelled with an ionic liquid, robust solid polymer electrolytes with outstanding room-temperature (22 °C) shear modulus (G’ > 108 Pa) and ionic conductivities up to σ = 3 × 10−4 S cm−1 are achieved. The nanostructured 3D-printed electrolytes are fabricated into a custom geometry and employed in a symmetric carbon supercapacitor, demonstrating the scalability of the fabrication and the functionality of the electrolyte. Critically, these high-performance materials are manufactured on demand using inexpensive and commercially available 3D printers, which allows the facile modular design of solid polymer electrolytes with custom geometries. © 2022 The Authors.

With the progression of Sm3+ concentration, the density of the sample improved from 3.423 g/cm3 to 3.495 g/cm3, while the molar volume raised from 21.760 cm3/mol to 23.665 cm3/mol. The XRD analysis verified the samples’ amorphous nature. Besides, the longitudinal and shear velocity range between 5265.15 and 5706.244 m/s and 2900.247–3039.522 m/s, respectively. The elastic moduli for longitudinal, shear, bulk, and Young's modulus range between 96.389–111.457 GPa, 29.247–31.624 GPa, 56.493–69.292 GPa, and 75.000–82.345, respectively. Furthermore, with the increment of Sm3+ concentration, the sample's Poisson's ratio reduces from 0.302 to 0.270, indicating a progressive rise in cross-link density due to increased glass ionicity. Moreover, the fractal bond connectivity and fugacity rise from 1.826 to 2.170 and 0.060 to 0.083, respectively, with the progression of Sm3+ concentration. The findings imply that the Sm3+ dopant acts as a glass modifier, impacting the elastic performance of the zinc-borosilicate glasses. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH","Elastic properties; Mechanical properties; Samarium; Zinc-borosilicate glass","Borosilicate glass; Samarium compounds; Shear flow; Silica; Zinc compounds; Elastic analysis; Elastic properties; Longitudinal velocity; Mechanical analysis; Melt quenching method; Shear velocities; Shear-velocity; Velocity range; XRD analysis; Zinc borosilicate glass; Elastic moduli","","","","","Universiti Putra Malaysia, UPM, (GP-GPB/2021/9702600); Universiti Putra Malaysia, UPM","This research was supported by the Universiti Putra Malaysia through the Geran Putra Berimpak ( GP-GPB/2021/9702600 ) for this research work.","Khazaalah T.H., Shahrim Mustafa I., Al-Ghamdi H., Abdul Rahman A., Sayyed M.I., Almuqrin A.H., Mohd Zaid M.H., Hisam R., Abdul Malik M.F.I., Seth Ezra N., Mohd Shariff H., The effect of WO3-doped soda lime silica SLS waste glass to develop lead-free glass as a shielding material against radiation, Sustainability, 14, (2022); Hisham N.A.N., Zaid M.H.M., Matori K.A., Shabdin M.K., Effect of ark clam shell on crystal growth and mechanical evaluation of foam glass-ceramic derived from cullet glass waste, Mater.

However, this technology still requires more development in order to enable the application of lattice structures in lightweight load bearing structures. The main challenge lies in the structural integrity of additively manufactured lattice structures which holds back exploiting their lightweight potential. While recent research focuses on the influence of process parameters on the mechanical behaviour of lattice structures, less attention is given to geometrical notches issued from sharp edges induced by the structural design. This contribution handles the effect of geometrically induced notches in truss lattice structures. The static mechanical properties of truss-like unit cells are compared to, on the one hand, the common design solution which consists in implementing a fillet radius and, on the other hand, two notch stress optimization methods inspired from existing methods for two-dimensional notches. The comparison encompasses the analytical development of the aforementioned methods as well as their numerical verification and experimental validation for additively manufactured lattices made of AlSi10Mg. Resulting recommendations on design guidelines for improved mechanical properties of truss lattice structures are then discussed. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Lattice structures; Lightweight design; Notch effect; Stress reduction","3D printers; Additives; Investment casting; Sheet metal; Structural design; Structural properties; Trusses; Additive manufacturing technology; Conventional methods; Expanded metals; Lattice structures; Lightweight design; Loadbearing structure; Metallic wire; Notch effect; Optimisations; Stress reduction; Numerical methods","","","","","Technical University of Darmstadt","We acknowledge support by the Open Access Publishing Fund of Technical University of Darmstadt.","Ashby M.F., Medalist R.F.M., The mechanical properties of cellular solids, MTA, 14, 9, pp. 1755-1769, (1983); Ha N.S., Lu G., A review of recent research on bio-inspired structures and materials for energy absorption applications, Compos.

The printing inks for direct-write printing however, need careful synthesis and invariably undergo extensive preparation before being able to print. Hence, new ink synthesis efforts are required every time a new material is to be printed; this is particularly challenging for low storage modulus (G’) materials like silicones, especially at higher resolutions (under 10 µm). Here we report the development of a precise (< 10 µm) 3D printable polymer, with which we 3D print micromoulds which are filled with standard silicones like polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and left to cure at room temperature. The proof of concept is demonstrated using a simple water soluble polymer as the mould material. The approach enables micrometre scale silicone structures to be prototyped with ease, away from the cleanroom. © 2022 The Authors","Flexible/soft material prototyping; High-resolution 3D printing; Micromoulding; Precision prototyping; Water based ink","3D printers; Filled polymers; Ink; Polydimethylsiloxane; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Direct write; Flexible/soft material prototyping; High resolution; High-resolution 3d printing; Micro molding; Precision prototyping; Softer materials; Water-based inks; Silicones","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; European Research Council, ERC; Horizon 2020, (714712); Horizon 2020; Wellcome / EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, WEISS, (203145Z/16/Z); Wellcome / EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, WEISS","Funding text 1: Partial support from the Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences ( WEISS ) ( 203145Z/16/Z ), European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant agreement no. 714712 and EPSRC DTP studentship award are gratefully acknowledged. ; Funding text 2: The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Manish K.

It is a one-dimensional four-element linear array and has a single piece configuration. Its main body is made of dielectric material and partial surfaces are coated by copper films through electroplating to form necessary metal components. Regarding to each element, it is based on a circular waveguide and employs an inbuilt linearly tapered double-ridge structure to act as a polarizer. To design such a polarizer, different shaped ridges are analyzed and a design evolution is presented and discussed. Compared to the conventional designs, the proposed element and array can avoid structure partitioning during the processing, and effectively reduce the fabrication difficulty and complexity, meanwhile, attain light weights. To validate the design idea, two prototypes corresponding to the element and the array are fabricated and tested. Experimental results indicate that their axial ratio bandwidth (ARBW) are 22% (8.9–11.1 GHz) and 11.8% (9.6–10.8 GHz), and the gain are 6.6 ± 1.1 and 10.6 ± 0.6 dBic, respectively. The proposed element and array could be potentially applied for satellite and other CP communication systems. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","3-D printing; circular polarization; open-ended waveguide antenna; ridged waveguide","Additives; Antenna arrays; Circular waveguides; Dielectric materials; Microwave antennas; Optical instruments; 3-D printing; Additive manufacturing technology; Circularly-polarized; One-dimensional; Open ended waveguides; Open-ended waveguide antenna; Polarisers; Ridged waveguides; Waveguide antenna arrays; Waveguide antennas; Circular polarization","","","","","Funds for Construction of Double World Class Project, (x2dx/D6192120); Guangzhou Science and Technology Foundation Basic and Applied Basic Research Project, (202102020861); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61901175)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 61901175; Guangzhou Science and Technology Foundation Basic and Applied Basic Research Project, Grant/Award Number: 202102020861; and Funds for Construction of Double World Class Project, Grant/Award Number: x2dx/D6192120. ; Funding text 2: Funds for Construction of Double World Class Project, Grant/Award Number: x2dx/D6192120; Guangzhou Science and Technology Foundation Basic and Applied Basic Research Project, Grant/Award Number: 202102020861; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 61901175 Funding information ","Balanis C.A., Antenna Theory: Analysis and Design, (2015); Baudrand H., Tao J.W., Atechian J., Study of radiating properties of open-ended rectangular waveguides, IEEE Trans Antennas Propag, 36, 8, pp. 1071-1077, (1988); Kanda M., Orr R., Near-field gain of a horn and an open-ended waveguide: comparison between theory and experiment, IEEE Trans Antennas Propag, 35, 1, pp. 33-40, (1987); Seong N.S., Park S.O., A microstrip-fed cavity-backed circularly polarized horn antenna, Microw Opt Technol Lett, 48, 12, pp. 2454-2456, (2006); Huang Y.Z., Geng J.P., Jin R.H., Et al., A novel compact circularly polarized horn antenna, IEEE Antennas Propag Soc Int Symp, 2014, pp. 43-44, (2014); Shu C., Wang J.B., Hu S.Q., Et al., A wideband dual-circular-polarization horn antenna for mmWave wireless communications, IEEE Antennas Wirel Propag Lett, 18, 9, pp. 1726-1730, (2019); Luo N., Yu X., Mishra G., Sharma S.K., A millimeter-wave (V-band) dual-circular-polarized horn antenna based on an inbuilt monogroove polarizer, IEEE Antennas Wirel Propag Lett, 19, 11, pp. 1933-1937, (2020); Barbuto M., Trotta F., Bilotti F., Toscano A., A combined bandpass filter and polarization transformer for horn antennas, IEEE Antennas Wirel Propag Lett, 12, pp. 1065-1068, (2013); Lu K., Leung K.W., Yang N., 3-D-printed circularly polarized twisted-ridge horn antenna, IEEE Trans Antennas Propag, 69, 3, pp. 1746-1750, (2021); Lin C.X., Ge Y.H., Bird T.S., Liu K.T., Circularly polarized horns based on standard horns and a metasurface polarizer, IEEE Antennas Wirel Propag Lett, 17, 3, pp. 480-484, (2018); Bhardwaj S., Volakis J.L., Hexagonal waveguide based circularly polarized horn antennas for sub-mm-wave/terahertz band, IEEE Trans Antennas Propag, 66, 7, pp. 3366-3374, (2018); Shahrubudin N., Lee T.C., Ramlan R., An overview on 3D printing technology: technological, materials, and applications, Procedia Manuf, 35, pp. 1286-1296, (2019); Xia Z.X., Leung K.W., Lu K., 3-D-printed wideband multi-ring dielectric resonator antenna, IEEE Antennas Wirel Propag Lett, 18, 10, pp. 2110-2114, (2019); Farooqui M.F., Kishk A., 3-D-printed tunable circularly polarized microstrip patch antenna, IEEE Antennas Wirel Propag Lett, 18, 7, pp. 1429-1432, (2019); Muntoni G., Montisci G., Casula G.A., Et al., A curved 3-D printed microstrip patch antenna layout for bandwidth enhancement and size reduction, IEEE Antennas Wirel Propag Lett, 19, 7, pp. 1118-1122, (2020); Tawk Y., Chahoud M., Fadous M., Costantine J., Christodoulou C.G., The miniaturization of a partially 3-D printed quadrifilar helix antenna, IEEE Trans Antennas Propag, 65, 10, pp. 5043-5051, (2017); Wang C., Wu J., Guo Y.X., A 3-D-printed wideband circularly polarized parallel-plate Luneburg lens antenna, IEEE Trans Antennas Propag, 68, 6, pp. 4944-4949, (2020); Wang C., Wu J., Guo Y.X., A 3-D-printed multibeam dual circularly polarized Luneburg lens antenna based on quasi-icosahedron models for Ka-band wireless applications, IEEE Trans Antennas Propag, 68, 8, pp. 5807-5815, (2020); Huang J., Chen S.J., Xue Z.H., Withayachumnankul W., Fumeaux C., Wideband circularly polarized 3-D printed dielectric rod antenna, IEEE Trans Antennas Propag, 68, 2, pp. 745-753, (2020); Pozar D.M., Microwave Engineering, (2011)","Z.L.

The optimization algorithm not only incorporates safety requirements in the form of ultimate limit state (ULS) and serviceability limit state (SLS) criteria but also deals with the economics simultaneously. In that regard, the generalized reduced gradient (GRG) method is used for the optimization purpose to achieve the least construction cost of an isolated foundation along with the integration of design parameters as optimization variables. The optimization technique is elaborated using a design example in silty clayey soil and the results of the optimized design are compared with those of the conventional design. The optimization model shows that the optimized design can reduce the construction cost by up to 44% as compared to the conventional design cost for the particular example. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is also performed to evaluate the quantitative impact of cohesive soil properties, design load, and groundwater table on the construction cost. The results indicate that the construction cost majorly depends on the combined effect of four key parameters: Young’s modulus, recompression index, design load, and groundwater table. © 2022 by the authors.","cohesive soil; generalized reduced gradient; isolated footing; optimized design; sensitivity analysis","","","","","","","","Driscoll R., Simpson B., EN1997 Eurocode 7: Geotechnical Design, Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers-Civil Engineering, 144, pp. 49-54, (2001); Nawaz M.M., Khan S.R., Farooq R., Nawaz M.N., Khan J., Tariq M.A.U.R., Tufail R.F., Farooq D., Ng A.W.M., Development of a Cost-Based Design Model for Spread Footings in Cohesive Soils, Sustainability, 14, (2022); Wellington A.M., The Economic Theory of the Location of Railways: An Analysis of the Conditions Controlling the Laying Out of Railways in Effect This Most Judicious Expenditure of Capital, (1887); Coduto D.P., Kitch W.A., Yeung M.R., Foundation Design: Principles and Practices, 2, (2001); Lambe T.W., Whitman R.V., Soil Mechanics, 10, (1991); Sowers G.F., Introductory Soil Mechanics & Foundations, Geotech.

LR fluxes were exposed to Nb in air; the working gas in the PF chamber was helium. It is shown that, in contrast to the effect of helium ion and helium plasma fluxes on niobium in the PF installation, which contribute to the erosion of the material, irradiation of niobium with pulsed LR in air fluxes under the implemented conditions does not cause noticeable surface erosion. When Nb is exposed to pulsed LR in the FR mode, the melt interacts with air and forms a thin film of elements of liquid and gas phases on the irradiated surface. A similar nature of Nb damageability under conditions of laser and beam-plasma treatment was found: a wavy relief of the irradiated surface with the presence of droplike fragments on it, extended wave crests, and microcracks. Irradiation of Nb with pulsed LR fluxes in the FR mode leads to formation of sections with block and cellular structures in the surface layer (SL), which are also formed after experiments in the PF chamber. It was found that, after laser treatment in the FR and Q-switched modes, bubbles (blisters) are not formed in the SL of niobium, which are always present on the irradiated surface when exposed to pulsed fluxes of HI and HP in the PF chamber owing to implantation of helium ions into Nb. It is noted that, in laser experiments, there is no possibility of implanting working gas ions into the material, which is typical of beam-plasma impacts in PF devices, which affects damageability parameters and modification of the structure of the irradiated SL. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","crystallization; helium ions; helium plasma; laser radiation; melting; microstructure; plasma focus; pulsed fluxes","Helium; Ions; Irradiation; Niobium; Plasma applications; Plasma devices; Plasma theory; Pulsed lasers; Radiation effects; Exposed to; Helium ion; Helium plasmas; Ion plasmas; Irradiated surface; Melting; Plasma focus; Pulsed flux; Pulsed laser radiation; Surface layers; Erosion","","","","","International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, (23664); International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA","This work was carried out in accordance with state assignments no. 075-00328-21-00 and no. 075-00715-22-00 and supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA CRP grant no. 23664.

The fluidic oscillator used is a classical curved (Type-II) Sweeping Jet (SWJ) actuator with two feedback channels. The interior surface finish of each sample is characterized using an optical 3D measurement system. The performance of the emanated jet is evaluated using hot-wire anemometry downstream of the outlet nozzle while the required supply pressure is recorded using a high-frequency pressure transducer at the actuator inlet. A bifurcated velocity profile of the external flow typical for the SWJ is observed in all cases, irrespective of the manufacturing process and surface roughness Sa< 20 μm. The jet velocity profiles are found to be satisfactorily self-similar, confirming that the surface roughness in the examined range does not qualitatively change the internal flow dynamics. However, increasing the surface roughness causes a reduction in the output jet spreading and a concomitant increase in the jet oscillation frequency. A linear model is presented to estimate the jet spreading versus the surface roughness. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Additive manufacturing; Fluidic oscillator; Surface roughness; Sweeping jet actuator","3D printers; Actuators; Additives; Feedback channel; Fluidic oscillators; Interior surfaces; Jet actuators; Optical 3D-measurement; Performance; Surface finishes; Sweeping jet actuator; Type II; Velocity profiles; Surface roughness","","","","","Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research, KU, (CIRA-2019-025)","This publication is based upon work supported by the Khalifa University of Science and Technology under Award No. CIRA-2019-025 .

However, since abnormal process states rarely occur in regular manufacturing settings, the data collected for model training may be highly imbalanced, which may result in significant training bias for supervised learning and, thus, further deteriorate the anomaly detection accuracy. To reduce the training bias, a natural idea is to incorporate data augmentation techniques to generate effective artificial sample data for the abnormal process states. However, most of the existing data augmentation methods do not effectively consider the temporal orders of the sensor signals, and they also usually require large amounts of actual samples to ensure satisfactory augmentation performance. To address these limitations, this article developed a novel data-driven methodology termed augmented time regularized generative adversarial network (ATR-GAN). By incorporating a proposed augmented generator, ATR-GAN is capable of generating more effective artificial samples for training supervised learning models. The novelty of this augmented generator in the proposed methodology can be summarized into three aspects: 1) an augmented filter layer is introduced in the augmented generator to identify the high-quality artificial samples; 2) in the augmented filter layer, a new distance metric termed time-regularized Hausdorff (TRH) distance is developed to accurately measure the similarity between actual samples and the generated artificial samples; and 3) batching techniques are also employed in the proposed augmented generator to further increase the diversity of the artificial data and fully utilize the relatively limited training data. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed ATR-GAN is also validated by both numerical simulation and a real-world case study in additive manufacturing. Note to Practitioners-Online process anomaly detection currently plays a significant role in advanced manufacturing since unexpected anomalies may damage product quality and even result in catastrophic loss. In practice, processes are mostly under normal conditions, and anomalies rarely occur. Therefore, the data collected under abnormal conditions are very limited compared to normal conditions, which causes the data imbalanced issue, leading to deterioration in detection accuracy. Many existing data augmentation methods, such as generative adversarial network (GAN), cannot synthesize diversified high-quality artificial samples only using relatively limited actual samples. There is an urgent need in developing an effective data augmentation methodology to address the data imbalanced issue in process anomaly detection. This article developed a novel approach called augmented time regularized GAN (ATR-GAN) for online sensor data augmentation. With this new approach, the applications in additive manufacturing demonstrate that the performance of data augmentation can be improved effectively, and thereafter, the anomaly detection accuracy is also increased significantly. Moreover, the developed methodology is inherently integrated into a generic framework. Thus, it can be further transformed for applications in many other areas that need data augmentation.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Advanced manufacturing; augmented generator; augmented time regularized generative adversarial network (ATR-GAN); data augmentation; online process anomaly detection","Anomaly detection; Biological systems; Generative adversarial networks; Manufacture; Advanced manufacturing; Anomaly detection; Augmented generator; Augmented time regularized generative adversarial network; Biological system modeling; Data augmentation; Generator; Manufacturing; Manufacturing process; On-line process; Online process anomaly detection.; Supervised learning","","","","","","","Monostori L., Markus A., Van Brussel H., Westkampfer E., Machine learning approaches to manufacturing, CIRP Ann., 45, 2, pp. 675-712, (1996); Liu C., Kong Z., Babu S., Joslin C., Ferguson J., An integrated manifold learning approach for high-dimensional data feature extractions and its applications to online process monitoring of additive manufacturing, IISE Trans., 53, 11, pp. 1215-1230, (2021); Chawla N.V., Japkowicz N., Kotcz A., Special issue on learning from imbalanced data sets, ACM SIGKDD Explor.

However, many existing single-frame-based methods do not provide sufficient range resolution. Even those capable of sufficient range resolution mostly result in insufficient signal-to-noise ratio or depend on spatially windowed uniqueness, where a larger window makes the identification trickier. Methods: This paper presents a novel method for rapid structured-light range sensing using a binary color stripe pattern. For accurate and reliable depth acquisition, we identify projected stripes by our stripe segmentation and unwrapping algorithms. For robust stripe detection, the color-stripe segmentation algorithm performs image upsizing, motion blurring, and color balancing. The binary stripe unwrapping algorithm consists of mean-speed walk unrolling, row-wise unrolling, and local median cor-rection, and resolves the high-frequency color-stripe redundancy efficiently and reliably. Results: Experimental results show the effectiveness and reliability of the presented method. Conclusion: Even using an entry-level phone camera under a low-cost DLP projector produces high-accuracy results. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.","binary stripe unwrapping; local median correction; mean-speed walk; range sensing; shape acquisition; Structured light","","","","","","Ministry of Education, MOE, (2019R1I1A1A01064120); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2016R1C1B2011804); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","Funding text 1: We are grateful to Jae-Woo Lee for his time and patience as the subject of the experimental results.

However, the grain size and mechanical anisotropy of WAAM materials have a certain impact on the application. In this paper, the influence of two kinds of layer control methods based on DHWAAM on grain size is studied. The β grain morphology of the layer cooling method is mostly the mixed morphology of small-size short columnar grain and equiaxed grain, while the continuous deposition method is coarse columnar grain. The layer cooling method is beneficial to grain refinement. The tensile results show that the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the layer cooling method is 6.5 % higher than that of the continuous deposition method, but the elongation has no significant change. In addition, the mechanical anisotropy of the titanium alloy fabricated by DHWAAM was also studied. The mechanical properties of the tensile samples at different angles were different. The% in plane anisotropy (%IPA) of UTS was 4.48. The fracture mode is quasi cleavage fracture. The pore defects (unfused pores and gas pores) in DHWAAM were characterized by XCT. The formation mechanism of different pore types is analyzed as well. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Layer control method; Mechanical anisotropy; Wire arc additive manufacturing","Additives;

Under UAM-processing conditions, complex interfaces are created between these materials due to high-strain rate (> 105 s−1) plastic deformation. Fundamental understanding of strengthening mechanisms at these interfaces are needed for engineering deployment. In this research, we correlated the interface microstructure to their strengthening mechanisms using nanoindentation and electron microscopy techniques. Strengthening at interface regions is correlated to microstructural features at different length scales including refined grains (200 nm), increase in vacancy clusters (1016 cm−3), and dislocation networks (1010 cm−2). This conclusion was arrived through superposition principles to describe the combination of many strengthening mechanisms and their respective microstructure feature sensitivity. © 2022, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.","","3D printers; Additives; Complex networks; Microstructure; Strengthening (metal); Additive manufacturing technology; Complex geometries; Complex interface; Embedded sensors; High-strain-rate; Metal interface; Processing condition; Strengthening effect; Strengthening mechanisms; Ultrasonic additive manufacturing; Strain rate","","","","","Institute of Advanced Materials and Manufacturing; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL; University of Tennessee, UT; National Institute for Materials Science, NIMS","Funding text 1: This manuscript has been authored by UT-Battelle, LLC under Contract No. DE-AC05- 00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy.

The connection between the support and the model has a high impact on the mechanical fixturing, the heat conduction, the removability of the support and the success of printing. In this research work, some support and tooth parameters such as the top length, the hatch distance, and Z offset were investigated to create a model-support connection strength map. This knowledge makes it possible to select the most appropriate connection type between the support and the model by the requirements specified in different cases. The strength of the support-model connection was characterized by the shearing properties using the torsion test. The results are illustrated and compared by different support parameters and materials. The 316L stainless steel and Ti6Al4V alloy were investigated. Different failure modes were determined depending on the chosen parameters. © 2022 The Authors","Additive; L-PBF; Laser; Metal; Model; Support","Aluminum alloys; Heat conduction; Industrial research; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Torsion testing; Torsional stress; Vanadium alloys; Connections strength; Fixturing; Fusion technology; High impact; L-PBF; Laser powders; Mechanical; Metal parts; Powder bed; Shearing property; Additives","","","","","Nemzeti Kutatási Fejlesztési és Innovációs Hivatal, NKFIH, (2019-1.1.1-PIACI-KFI-2019-00139); Nemzeti Kutatási, Fejlesztési és Innovaciós Alap, NKFIA","The project is funded by the National Research, Development and Innovation (NKFIH) Fund.

Poor contact of grafts with defective bones and insufficient osteogenic activities lead to increased loose risks and unsatisfied repair efficacy. Although self-expanding scaffolds were developed to enhance bone integration, the limitations on the high transition temperature and the unsatisfied bioactivity hindered greatly their clinical application. Herein, we report a near-infrared-responsive and tight-contacting scaffold that comprises of shape memory polyurethane (SMPU) as the thermal-responsive matrix and magnesium (Mg) as the photothermal and bioactive component, which fabricated by the low temperature rapid prototyping (LT-RP) 3D printing technology. As designed, due to synergistic effects of the components and the fabrication approach, the composite scaffold possesses a homogeneously porous structure, significantly improved mechanical properties and stable photothermal effects. The programmed scaffold can be heated to recover under near infrared irradiation in 60s. With 4 wt% Mg, the scaffold has the balanced shape fixity ratio of 93.6% and shape recovery ratio of 95.4%. The compressed composite scaffold could lift a 100 g weight under NIR light, which was more than 1700 times of its own weight. The results of the push-out tests and the finite element analysis (FEA) confirmed the tight-contacting ability of the SMPU/4 wt%Mg scaffold, which had a signficant enhancement compared to the scaffold without shape memory effects. Furthermore, The osteopromotive function of the scaffold has been demonstrated through a series of in vitro and in vivo studies.

First of all, the SMPU/4 wt%Mg scaffold had a hierarchical porous structure through the LT-RP 3D printing method. In addition, the scaffold had a significant enhanced mechanical properties (a compress strength of ?6.7 MPa and a modulus of ?23.0 MPa) compared to the pristine SMPU scaffold (a compress strength of ?5.9 MPa and a modulus of ?16.8 MPa). The NIR-responsive shape memory effect was realized in the composite scaffold due to the photothermal effects of Mg particles and the thermo-responsivity of the SMPU, by which the temperature could be quickly elevated under NIR light to T > Tm rather than the contact actuation. High shape memory ratios lead to the programmability and supporting ability in defective site, in this work, Rf and Rr could be balanced in the SMPU/4 wt%Mg scaffold with a Rf of 93.6% and a Rr of 95.4%. The scaffold could lift the object more than 1700 times its own weight due to its shape recovery under NIR light. Furthermore, the composite scaffold was proved to support the cell survival, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in vitro cell experiments. More importantly, the animal studies demonstrated the tight-contacting and osteopromotive functions of the 3D printed composite scaffold. FEA results revealed the relationship between the tight-contact and the shape recovery process, confirming the tight-contacting ability of the SMPU/4%Mg scaffold under NIR light. As described, this SMPU/Mg composite scaffold took advantages of its components (SMPU and Mg) and the LT-RP 3D printing technology to achieve the synergistic effects for the final robust bone regeneration. We envision this 3D printed bone scaffold hold great promise to be translated into clinic for robust bone regeneration.YC.Z. and CR.L. contributed equally to this work.

The drone's flexible arms are equipped with a tendon-actuated bending system, which is used for applications that require physical interaction with the environment. The flexibility of the UAV can be controlled during the additive manufacturing process by adjusting the infill rate ρ TPU distribution. However, the increase in flexibility implies difficulties in controlling the UAV, as well as structural, aerodynamic, and aeroelastic effects. This article provides insight into the dynamics of the system and validates the flyability of the vehicle for densities as low as 6%. Within this range, quasi-static arm deformations can be considered, thus the autopilot is fed back through a static arm deflection model. At lower densities, strong non-linear elastic dynamics appear, which translates to complex modeling, and it is suggested to switch to data-based approaches. Moreover, this work demonstrates the ability of the soft UAV to perform full-body perching, specifically landing and stabilizing on pipelines and irregular surfaces without the need for an auxiliary system.  © 2022 IEEE.","Contact inspection; multirotor dynamics; soft aerial robotics; UAVs","3D printers; Aerodynamics; Antennas; Autonomous vehicles; Aerial robotics; Aerial vehicle; Arm; Contact inspection; Multirotor dynamic; Multirotors; Physical interactions; Soft aerial robotic; Solid modelling; Vehicle's dynamics; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","","","","",", (779411, 953454); ","","Rao B., Gopi A.G., Maione R., The societal impact of commercial drones, Technol.

Sedimentation has a major impact on reservoir and dam operations. This study conducted an experiment using a rainfall simulator with varying intensity of rainfall (1-3 L/min) with slopes from 0° to 5°, leading to the generation of runoff and sediment loads (SLs). Precipitation and runoff data from the rainfall simulator were used to develop a sediment load model via hybrid machine learning approaches. Predictive abilities of a robust phase space reconstruction integrated with support vector machine and firefly algorithm (PSR-SVM-FFA) were investigated for estimating sediment load. The accuracy of the PSR-SVM-FFA was assessed versus that of integrated support vector machine and firefly algorithm (SVM-FFA) and conventional support vector machine (SVM) models. In phase space reconstruction (PSR), the delay time constant and embedding dimension were determined to select optimal parameters in the SVM-FFA model. Four performance measures, namely RMS error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), Willmott index (WI), and bias, were employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. The results revealed that prominent values of WI were 0.942, 0.955, and 0.966 for the SVM, SVM-FFA, and PSR-SVM-FFA methods, respectively, for a slope of 4°. PSR-SVM-FFA had better performance than SVM-FFA and conventional SVM for each slope. Based on analysis of the obtained results, it is evident that PSR-SVM-FFA can estimate SL more accurately.  © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Firefly algorithm (FFA); Phase space reconstruction (PSR); Rainfall simulator (RS); Sand-tank slope; Sediment load (SL); Willmott index (WI)","Bioluminescence; Floods; Optimization; Phase space methods; Rain; Reservoirs (water); Runoff; Sediments; Simulators; Vector spaces; Vectors; Watersheds; Firefly algorithm; Firefly algorithms; Phase space reconstruction; Phase spaces; Rainfall simulator; Rainfall simulators; Sand tank; Sand-tank slope; Sediment load; Sediment loads; Space reconstruction; Willmott index; algorithm; bedload; precipitation (climatology); precipitation intensity; prediction; runoff; sedimentation; simulator; support vector machine; Support vector machines","","","","","","","Abudi I., Carmi G., Berliner P., Rainfall simulator for field runoff studies, J.

Some aspects of the WAAM process, such as the angles between welding torch direction, deposition surface normal and gravity are very important to ensure the quality of the manufactured parts. A task-priority based kinematic control scheme is proposed to control a manipulator and a positioning table coordinately. The manipulator and the positioning table are considered as a single robotic chain, and the primary task is defined to make the welding torch follow a desired trajectory defined in the positioning table deposition frame, while the secondary task is to align the welding torch in a desired direction defined in the inertial frame, e.g., gravity direction. A complete Lyapunov stability analysis is performed considering unmodeled dynamics in the kinematic control loop. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown experimentally on a WAAM robotic system composed of a 6-axis industrial manipulator, a 2-axis positioning table and a Cold Metal Transfer (CMT) power source.  © 2016 IEEE.","Additive manufacturing; Industrial robots; Motion control; Redundant robots","3D printers; Deposition; Industrial manipulators; Kinematics; Motion control; Surface treatment; Welding; Additive manufacturing process; Coordinated motion; Kinematics control; Positioning tables; Redundant robot; Robot kinematics; Task analysis; Trajectory tracking control; Welding torch; Wire arc; Trajectories","","","","","","","Ahmad S., Luo S., Coordinated motion control of multiple robotic devices for welding and redundancy coordination through constrained optimization in cartesian space, Proc.

These drawbacks, however, can be overcome by fabricating a new generation of biocompatible scaffolds with quantum nanoparticle additives and surface functionalization. The objective of the present work was to investigate the enhancement of cellular adhesion, growth, proliferation, differentiation and migration on polymer-based scaffolds. To achieve this, carbon dots (CDs) were melt blended with poly(L-Lactide) acid or PLA, followed by rapid prototyping to generate photoluminescent scaffolds with the advantages of hydrophilicity and built-in monitoring opportunity via two-photon microscopy. Apart from these, cell proliferation and migration aspects in the biological environment are found to be enhanced by oxygen plasma treatment which enables polymer superhydrophilicity. Carbon dots introduces nanoscale roughness, and plasma incorporates hydrophilic oxygen and hydroxyl groups on the scaffolds. After a 7 min plasma treatment, PLA-CD surfaces were found to gain superhydrophilicity (contact angle of 0˚) and cell proliferation increased by 70% relative to the untreated scaffold. Quantitative analysis and bioimaging showed significant increases in ECM mineralization. Thus, the plasma treated PLA-CD composite supports the potential for producing high-performance, monitorable scaffolds for tissue engineering. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Oxygen plasma; Polylactic acid; Polymer composites; Quantum dots; Scaffolds","3D printers; Additives; Biocompatibility; Bone; Carbon; Cell proliferation; Conjugated polymers; Contact angle; Oxygen; Scaffolds (biology); Bioresorbable; Bone regeneration; Carbon dots; Hydrophobics; Mechanically robust; Oxygen plasmas; Polymer composite; Super hydrophilicity; Synthesised; Synthetic polymers; Semiconductor quantum dots","","","","","Bosch Institute; Evonik Industries GmbH; Australian Research Council, ARC; University of Sydney, Usyd","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the polymer raw materials provided by Evonik Industries GmbH.

The microstructure and mechanical properties of Al-Mg-Mn-Er-Zr alloy of as-built and heat treated samples have been characterized, which shows: the precipitation of Al3Zr primary phase at the boundary of molten pool promotes heterogeneous nucleation and refines the grains, which suppresses the formation of solidification cracking in Al-Mg alloy. To bring the Er-Zr synergistic effect into play during the aging heat treatment, the nano-scale precipitation phase of Al3Er that diffuses nucleation at an earlier stage promotes the precipitation of Zr, leading to the formation of Al3(Er,Zr) core-shell structure and enhancing precipitation strengthening effect. Under the combined effects of multiple strengthening mechanisms, the yield strength could reach 440 ± 3 MPa; tensile strength, 520 ± 2 MPa and elongation 15.5 ± 1.0 %. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; Aluminum alloys; Er-Zr modification; Er-Zr synergism; Hot cracking","3D printers; Additives; Binary alloys; Cracks; High strength alloys; Magnesium alloys; Manganese alloys; Microstructure; Nucleation; Precipitation (chemical); Rare earths; Tensile strength; Zircaloy; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Er-zr modification; Er-zr synergism; High-strength; Hot-cracking; Laser powders; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Powder bed; Primary phase; Aluminum alloys","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51621003); Beijing Municipal Commission of Education, (KM 202110005010); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (2202009); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFB3704201, 2021YFB3704205)","This research was funded by National Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFB3704201 and 2021YFB3704205), General Program of Science and Technology Development Project of Beijing Municipal Education Commission (KM 202110005010), Beijing Natural Science Foundation (2202009), Innovative Research Group Project of the National Natural Science Fund (Grant No. 51621003).","Aboulkhair N.T., Simonelli M., Parry L., Ashcroft I., Tuck C., Hague R., 3D printing of Aluminium alloys: Additive Manufacturing of Aluminium alloys using selective laser melting, Prog.

Compared to conventional materials, they exhibit improved properties in terms of strength, thermal, wear or corrosion resistance. However, because of the varying material properties, especially the type of in-depth grading of Young’s modulus, the solution of contact problems including the frequently encountered tangential fretting becomes significantly more difficult. The present work is intended to contribute to this context. The partial-slip contact of axisymmetric, power-law graded elastic solids under classical loading by a constant normal force and an oscillating tangential force is investigated both numerically and analytically. For this purpose, a fictitious equivalent contact model in the mathematical space of the Abel transform is used since it simplifies the solution procedure considerably without being an approximation. For different axisymmetric shaped solids and various elastic inhomogeneities (types of in-depth grading), the hysteresis loops are numerically generated and the corresponding dissipated frictional energies per cycle are determined. Moreover, a closed-form analytical solution for the dissipated energy is derived, which is applicable for a breadth class of axisymmetric shapes and elastic inhomogeneities. The famous solution of Mindlin et al. emerges as a special case. © 2022 by the authors.","Abel transform; fretting; frictional energy dissipation; functionally graded materials; hysteresis loops; structural damping; tangential contact; Winkler foundation","","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG","We acknowledge support by the German Research Foundation and the Open Access Publication Fund of TU Berlin.","Nowell D., Dini D., Hills D., Recent developments in the understanding of fretting fatigue, Eng.

The main objective is increasing the autonomy and range of the UAV’s autonomous missions. Moreover, one of the main targets is to improve the capabilities of the aeronautical industry towards sustainable aircrafts and to acquire better mechanical properties owing to the use of additive technologies and new printing materials. Further, a lower environmental impact could be achieved through the use of renewable energies. Material extrusion (MEX) technology may be able to be used for the manufacture of stronger and lighter parts by using gyroids as the filling of the printed material. The paper proposes the use of minimal surfaces for the reinforcement of the UAV aircraft wings. This type of surface was never used because it is not possible to manufacture it using conventional techniques. The rapid growth of additive technologies led to many expectations for new design methodologies in the aeronautical industry. In this study, mechanical tests were carried out on specimens manufactured with different geometries to address the design and manufacture of a UAV as a demonstrator. In addition, to carry out the manufacture of the prototype, a 3D printer with a movable bench similar to a belt, that allows for the manufacture of parts without limitations in the Z axis, was tested. The parts manufactured with this technique can be structurally improved, and it is possible to avoid manufacturing multiple prints of small parts of the aircraft that will have to be glued later, decreasing the mechanical properties of the UAV. The conceptual design and manufacturing of a solar aircraft, SolarÍO, using additive technologies, is presented. A study of the most innovative 3D printers was carried out that allowed for the manufacture of parts with an infinite Z-axis and, in addition, a filler based on minimal surfaces (gyroids) was applied, which considerably increased the mechanical properties of the printed parts. Finally, it can be stated that in this article, the potential of the additive manufacturing as a new manufacturing process for small aircrafts and for the aeronautical sector in the future when new materials and more efficient additive manufacturing processes are already developed is demonstrated. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing (AM); material extrusion (MEX); polylactic acid (PLA); solar UAV","Ablation; Aircraft engine manufacture; Cutting; Extrusion; High temperature operations; Hot stamping; Stress relief; Surface mount technology; Additive manufacturing; Additive technology; Aerial vehicle; Design and manufactures; Material extrusion; Mechanical; Minimal surfaces; Polylactic acid; Property; Solar unmanned aerial vehicle; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","","","","","Government of Spain, (PID2019-108807RB-I00); Generalitat Valenciana, GVA, (IDIFEDER/2021/040); Generalitat Valenciana, GVA","This research received partial funding from the Government of Spain under the project PID2019-108807RB-I00 and Generalitat Valenciana under IDIFEDER/2021/040.","Wohlers T., Wohlers Report 2019: 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing State of the Industry, (2019); Gibson I., Rosen D.W., Stucker B., Additive Manufacturing Technologies, (2010); Goh G.D., Agarwala S., Goh G.L., Dikshit V., Sing S.L., Yeong W.Y., Additive manufacturing in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs): Challenges and potential, Aerosp.

However, current powder delivery systems are either not capable of continuous feeding of powders or cannot guarantee that the powders achieve a certain motion velocity to assure their uninterrupted motion into the melt pool. Therefore, a new powder delivery system is developed which use the advantages of vibration and pneumatic feeders. In this powder delivery system, vibration is used to disperse agglomerated powders and control the powder federate while pneumatic pressure is used to increase powder velocity to guarantee that the powder enters the melt pool. Powder flow simulation has been conducted to reveal powder flow characteristics. To test the feasibility of the developed powder delivery system for powder delivery and verify the correctness of powder flow simulation results, powder delivery experiments have been conducted. Effects of argon gas flowrate and vibration parameters on powder flowrate have been investigated. Experimental results show that a stable and repeatable powder flowrate can be controlled by adjusting the vibration parameters and the argon gas flowrate with the developed delivery system. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Additive manufacturing; Powder feeding; Powder flowrate; Vibration-assisted powder delivery","3D printers; Additives; Feeding; Flow simulation; Pneumatics; Additive manufacturing process; Continuous feeding; Delivery systems; Laser-based additive manufacturing; Melt pool; Pneumatic pressure; Powder feeding; Powder flowrate; Vibration assisted; Vibration-assisted powder delivery; Powders","","","","","High Level Personnel Project of Jiangsu Province, (JSSCBS20210188); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52105452); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (56XAC22006); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","The authors gratefully acknowledge the supports of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52105452 ), High Level Personnel Project of Jiangsu Province (Grant No. JSSCBS20210188 ).

The solvent rapidly evaporates in-flight, depositing the dry solute material onto a target surface. Over time, the material aggregates to create thin, continuous films. Here, we report on the printing of polymeric (polyimide) films onto two target substrates: flat silicon wafers and industry-standard bond wires and pads. Unlike other spray-coating processes, electrospray is driven by the electric field, and the emitted droplets/particles are guided to the target surface by electric field lines. This enables the coating to wrap around complex geometries to deliver material to non-line-of-sight surfaces. The films showed high conformality around the complex geometries of the bond packages. The printed coatings also exhibited good dielectric strength (up to 142 V/µm), increased hydrophobicity (112° ± 9°), and corrosion resistance improvement up to four times.

The proof of concept was experimentally demonstrated and benchmarking 3D woodpile nanostructures, micro-scaffolds, free-form micro-object “Benchy” and bulk micro-cubes are successfully produced. The essential novelty underlies the fact that non-amplified laser systems delivering just 40–500 pJ individual pulses are sufficient for inducing localized cross-linking reactions within hundreds of nanometers in cross sections. And it is opposed to the prejudice that higher pulse energies and lower repetition rates of amplified lasers are necessary for structuring non-photosensitized polymers. The experimental work is of high importance for fundamental understanding of laser enabled nanoscale 3D additive manufacturing and widens technology’s field of applications where the avoidance of photo-initiator is preferable or is even a necessity, such as micro-optics, nano-photonics, and biomedicine. © 2022, Central South University.","3D printing; additive manufacturing; laser direct writing; microstructures; multi-photon lithography; nanotechnology; SZ2080™; two-photon polymerization","Additives; Crosslinking; Nanotechnology; Organic lasers; organic-inorganic materials; Photons; Polymerization; Pulse repetition rate; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Laser direct writing; Laser direct-writing; Micro/nano; Multi-photon lithography; Multiphotons; Photoinitiators; Sz2080™; Two photon polymerization; 3D printers","","","","","EU Horizon 2020, Research and Innovation; Lietuvos Mokslo Taryba, (871124)","Project(S-MIP-20-17) supported by the Research Council of Lithuania; Project(871124) supported by the EU Horizon 2020, Research and Innovation program LASERLAB-EUROPE JRA","Saha S.K., Wang D., Nguyen V.H., Et al., Scalable submicrometer additive manufacturing [J], Science, 366, 6461, pp. 105-109, (2019); Kiefer P., Hahn V., Nardi M., Et al., Sensitive photoresists for rapid multiphoton 3D laser micro- and nano-printing [J], Advanced Optical Materials, 8, 19, (2020); Skliutas E., Lebedevaite M., Kabouraki E., Et al., Polymerization mechanisms initiated by spatio-temporally confined light [J], Nanophotonics, 10, 4, pp. 1211-1242, (2021); Malinauskas M., zukauskas A., Hasegawa S., Et al., Ultrafast laser processing of materials: From science to industry [J], Light: Science & Applications, 5, 8, (2016); Lunzer M., Beckwith J.S., Chalupa-Gantner F., Et al., Beyond the threshold: A study of chalcogenophene-based two-photon initiators [J], Chemistry of Materials: A Publication of the American Chemical Society, 34, 7, pp. 3042-3052, (2022); Ladika D., Noirbent G., Dumur F., Et al., Synthesis and application of triphenylamine-based aldehydes as photo-initiators for multi-photon lithography [J], Applied Physics A, 128, 9, pp. 1-8, (2022); Malinauskas M., Zukauskas A., Bickauskaite G., Et al., Mechanisms of three-dimensional structuring of photo-polymers by tightly focussed femtosecond laser pulses [J], Optics Express, 18, 10, pp. 10209-10221, (2010); Lebedevaite M., Ostrauskaite J., Skliutas E., Et al., Photoinitiator free resins composed of plant-derived monomers for the optical μ-3D printing of thermosets [J], Polymers, 11, 1, (2019); Greta M., Edvinas A., Mangirdas M., Laser additive manufacturing of Si/ZrO 2 tunable crystalline phase 3D nanostructures [J], Opto-Electronic Advances, 2022, 5, pp. 22-32; Malinauskas M., Purlys V., Rutkauskas M., Et al., Femtosecond visible light induced two-photon photopolymerization for 3D micro/nanostructuring in photoresists and photopolymers [J], Lithuanian Journal of Physics, 50, pp. 201-207, (2010); Malinauskas M., Danilevicius P., Juodkazis S., Three-dimensional micro-/nano-structuring via direct write polymerization with picosecond laser pulses [J], Optics Express, 19, 6, pp. 5602-5610, (2011); Thiel M., Fischer J., Von Freymann G., Et al., Direct laser writing of three-dimensional submicron structures using a continuous-wave laser at 532 nm [J], Applied Physics Letters, 97, 22, (2010); Hahn V., Kiefer P., Frenzel T., Et al., Rapid assembly of small materials building blocks (voxels) into large functional 3D metamaterials [J], Advanced Functional Materials, 30, 26, (2020); Hahn V., Messer T., Bojanowski N.M., Et al., Two-step absorption instead of two-photon absorption in 3D nanoprinting [J], Nature Photonics, 15, 12, pp. 932-938, (2021); Weber K., Werdehausen D., Konig P., Et al., Tailored nanocomposites for 3D printed micro-optics [J], Optical Materials Express, 10, 10, (2020); Gonzalez-Hernandez D., Varapnickas S., Merkininkaite G., Et al., Laser 3D printing of inorganic free-form micro-optics [J], Photonics, 8, 12, (2021); Butkute A., cekanavicius L., Rimselis G., Et al., Optical damage thresholds of microstructures made by laser three-dimensional nanolithography: Publisher’s note [J], Optics Letters, 45, 4, (2020); Reddy I.V.A.K., Bertoncini A., Liberale C., 3D-printed fiber-based zeroth- and high-order Bessel beam generator [J], Optica, 9, 6, (2022); Accardo A., Blatche M.C., Courson R., Et al., Multiphoton direct laser writing and 3D imaging of polymeric freestanding architectures for cell colonization [J], Small, 13, 27, (2017); Maciulaitis J., Rekstyte S., Bratchikov M., Et al., Customization of direct laser lithography-based 3D scaffolds for optimized in vivo outcome [J], Applied Surface Science, 487, pp. 692-702, (2019); Jonusauskas L., Gailevicius D., Rekstyte S., Et al., Mesoscale laser 3D printing [J], Optics Express, 27, 11, pp. 15205-15221, (2019); .

We proposed the toner-type, dry, page-printing of Ag–Ni composite conductive particles on flexible plastic sheets without pre-treatment. No chemical solvents are necessary to compose the inks of the electronic materials used for the toner-type printing, and no chemical treatment is required for the plastic film substrate surface. In addition, multilayer printing is simple when using toner printing because previously printed materials do not need to be resolved; furthermore, composing the thick films of the electronic materials is relatively simple. In this study, we fabricated an Ag–Ni composite toner to improve the fluidity of the toner particles compared to bare Ag particles. We successfully printed IC peripheral circuits at a resolution of 0.20 mm and demonstrated that the actual electrical circuit pattern can be formed using our method. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; conductive nanoparticle; flexible electronics; printed electronics","","","","","","Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST, (JPMJTM20CD); Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST; Adaptable and Seamless Technology Transfer Program through Target-Driven R and D, A-STEP","This research was funded by a grant from the A-STEP program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (number JPMJTM20CD).","Lu B.H., Lan H.B., Liu H.Z., Additive manufacturing frontier: 3D printing electronics, Opto-Electron Adv, 1, (2018); Sevilla G.A.T., Cordero M.D., Nassar J.M., Hanna A.N., Kutbee A.T., Arevalo A., Hussain M.M., Decal Electronics: Printable Packaged with 3D Printing High-Performance Flexible CMOS Electronic Systems, Adv.

The pre and post-sintering properties of the 3D printed ceramic parts highly depend on the polymerisation degree of the base resin binders and the rheological behaviour of ceramic slurry, and hot lithography can play a significant role both. First, the paper aimed to better understand how different printing temperatures (25,35,45 and 55 °C) would affect the properties of the base binder mixtures before loading ceramic particles, by conducting tensile, DMA and FTIR analysis on binder-only prints. The impact of elevated printing temperature on the mechanical properties of ceramic loaded binder mixtures was further investigated. The highest mechanical properties for the base binder and the ceramic loaded mixtures were achieved when the process temperature was set closer to the binder mixtures' initial glass transition temperature (when the binder is cured at room-temperature). This printing temperature is yet lower than the level causing heat-induced cross-linking yet high to enhance the mobility of monomers and active species, when compared with conventional room-temperature vat photopolymerisation printing. The results indicate that printing temperature, if set as described, can significantly impact the mechanical property of parts and conversion rate of the base binders for a successful print process. The second part of this study investigates the impact of temperature on the rheological behaviour and peeling forces of highly loaded ceramic-loaded mixtures (61.2 vol% of SiO2-ZrSiO4). The suspension showed shear thickening behaviour at 25 °C, hindering the replenishment of the slurry during printing, while a high transition from shear-thickening to shear-thinning behaviour, ideal for flawless ceramic 3D printing, was observed at an optimum process temperature of 35 °C. When print temperature increases to 45 °C and then 55 °C, the viscosity of the mixture at very low shear rate (when the material is static during printing) increases, hence affecting peeling forces. Comparing peeling force measurements and FTIR results showed the higher cross-linking density, and the reactivity of the base binder, leads to a stronger adhesion between the cured layers and the printer's transparent film, hence higher separation/peeling forces. To sum up, hot ceramic lithography at the right printing temperature can resolve many print and post print issues, such as deformation and cracking, leading to a stronger and more dimensionally-accurate ceramic components. © 2022 The Authors","Ceramic cores; Ceramic SLA; Ceramic vat-photopolymerisation; Hot ceramic lithography; Peeling forces; Temperature controlled ceramic 3D printing","Binders; Glass transition; Image enhancement; Investment casting; Lithography; Mixtures; Photopolymerization; Shear thinning; Sintering; Stereolithography; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Ceramic core; Ceramic SLA; Ceramic vat-photopolymerization; Hot ceramic lithography; Peeling force; Photo polymerization; Process temperature; Temperature controled ceramic 3d printing; Silica","","","","","AACME; Additive Manufacturing Centre of Excellence Ltd; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/L01534X/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; Loughborough University, Lboro","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support received from the AM Centre of Excellence in Derby, UK, and the Additive Manufacturing Research Group (AMRG) at the Loughborough University, and David Thompson from AMRG, Dawn Spencer from Wolfson Lab, and Sean Creedon from AACME.

Recently, big oil and gas companies have shown early progress in using additive technology in manufacturing specific heat exchangers, downhole cleanout tool nozzles, offshore risers, gas turbine nozzles, and subsea chemical stick injection tools. Despite the mentioned progress, the current adoption level of additive technology for the offshore oil and gas industry is very limited. Non-destructive and destructive evaluation methods of additively manufactured metallic components have been studied extensively. However, the technique selection procedure and scope of the required test methods have not been studied sufficiently. This paper discusses various elements related to the qualification of additively manufactured components for application in the oil and gas industry. A risk-based qualification method for identifying the scopes of required non-destructive and destructive tests and the resulting qualification procedure for additively manufactured spare components in offshore oil and gas applications is suggested. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; non-destructive testing; offshore industry; qualification; spare parts","","","","","","","","Tutunchi A., Eskandarzade M., Osouli-Bostanabad K., Shahrivar R., Risk Assessment of an Urban Natural Gas Polyethylene Piping System, J.

These problems lead to limitations in activities of daily life (ADL), labor- and leisure participation, and increase the health care costs. Shoulder problems are often associated with the long-term reliance on the upper limbs, and the accompanying “shoulder load”. To make an estimation of daily shoulder load, it is crucial to know which ADL are performed and how these are executed in the free-living environment (in terms of magnitude, frequency, and duration). The aim of this study was to develop and validate methodology for the classification of wheelchair related shoulder loading ADL (SL-ADL) from wearable sensor data. Ten able bodied participants equipped with five Shimmer sensors on a wheelchair and upper extremity performed eight relevant SL-ADL. Deep learning networks using bidirectional long short-term memory networks were trained on sensor data (acceleration, gyroscope signals and EMG), using video annotated activities as the target. Overall, the trained algorithm performed well, with an accuracy of 98% and specificity of 99%. When reducing the input for training the network to data from only one sensor, the overall performance decreased to around 80% for all performance measures. The use of only forearm sensor data led to a better performance than the use of the upper arm sensor data. It can be concluded that a generalizable algorithm could be trained by a deep learning network to classify wheelchair related SL-ADL from the wearable sensor data. © 2022 by the authors.","classification; deep learning; shoulder loading activities; wearable sensors; wheelchair","Humans; Machine Learning; Shoulder; Upper Extremity; Wearable Electronic Devices; Wheelchairs; Deep learning; Frequency estimation; Learning systems; Loading; Wearable sensors; Activities of Daily Life; Deep learning; Learning network; Machine learning approaches; Manual wheelchair; Performance; Sensors data; Shoulder loading activity; Shoulder loads; Wheelchair users; electronic device; human; machine learning; shoulder; upper limb; wheelchair; Classification (of information)","","","","","UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (133202)","","Arnet U., de Vries W.H., Eriks-Hoogland I., Wisianowsky C., van der Woude L.H.V., Veeger D., Berger M., MRI evaluation of shoulder pathologies in wheelchair users with spinal cord injury and the relation to shoulder pain, J.

Additive manufacturing was used to embed optical fiber-based pressure sensors inside thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), a material used for lining and shock-dampening that fills the space between a helmet's hard outer shell and the head. A proof-of-concept has successfully demonstrated sensitive shock-monitoring capabilities, thus avoiding the inaccuracies in existing systems. The sensors can be embedded into additively manufactured parts in new or existing helmets and are unobtrusive to the wearers. This proposed system can be powered by readily available medical-grade cell batteries and requires less maintenance. © 2017 IEEE.","additive manufacturing for photonic sensor integration; fiber Bragg grating (FBG); fused filament fabrication (FFF); Sensor integration; stereolithography apparatus (SLA)","3D printers; Liquid chromatography; Safety devices; Sports; Embeddings; Fiber bragg grating; Fiber gratings; Field flow fractionation; Fused filament fabrication; Head; Head impact; Shock sensor; Stereo-lithography apparatus; Stereolithography apparatus; Fiber Bragg gratings","","","","","","","Covassin T., Savage J.L., Bretzin A.C., Fox M.E., Sex differences in sportrelated concussion long-term outcomes, Int.

Traditional manual depowdering is extremely time-consuming and costly, and some prior automated systems either require pre-depowdering or lack adaptability to different 3D-printed parts. To solve these problems, we introduce a robotic system that automatically removes unfused powder from the surface of 3D-printed parts. The key component is a visual perception system, which consists of a pose-tracking module that tracks the 6D pose of powder-occluded parts in real-time, and a progress estimation module that estimates the depowdering completion percentage. The tracking module can be run efficiently on a laptop CPU at up to 60 FPS. Experiments show that our system can remove unfused powder from the surface of various 3D-printed parts without causing any damage. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first vision-based depowdering systems that adapt to parts with various shapes without the need for pre-depowdering.  © 2016 IEEE.","Computer vision for manufacturing; industrial robots; service robotics","3D printers; Additives; Computer vision; Gesture recognition; Industrial robots; Automated systems; Computer vision for manufacturing; Point cloud compression; Point-clouds; Pose tracking; Powder-based; Service robotics; Shape; Solid modelling; Tracking module; Surface treatment","","","","","Carnegie Mellon University Manufacturing Futures Initiative; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA","This work was supported in part by Carnegie Mellon University Manufacturing Futures Initiative and in part by NASA University Leadership Initiative.","Guthrie M., Hp and Am Solutions Present the Innovative Hp Jet Fusion 5200 Series 3D Automatic Unpacking Station, (2020); (2022); Cormack J., Fotouhi M., Adams G., Pipe T., Automated extraction of 3D printed parts from unfused PA12 powder using a one-shot 3D printed compliant gripper, IEEE Trans.

A major advantage of this technique is the ability to produce scaffolds that resemble the native extracellular matrix in physical, chemical, and topological properties. However, scaffolds fabricated via electrospinning are not formed with a controlled architecture and typically do a poor job of directing cell growth into prescribed structures for tissue/organ development. To address these weaknesses, 3D bioprinting has recently been used to develop scaffolds that have a highly organized and precise global topology. Unfortunately, these 3D bioprinted scaffolds do not typically resemble the native extracellular matrix in physical properties, such as porosity, fiber diameter, and pore size (e.g., the microarchitecture). Thus, the goal of the current study was to develop a technique that harnesses the intrinsic advantages of both conventional electrospinning and 3D bioprinting techniques to produce scaffolds that have the potential to be used within biomedical applications. The physical properties of formed 3D printed electrospun scaffolds were compared with conventional electrospun and 3D printed scaffolds. Further, we conducted initial proof-of-concept biocompatibility studies to illustrate the applicability of the scaffolds within vascular applications. Our results illustrate that 3D printed electrospun scaffolds can be developed, via our technique, that have highly tailored and organized arbitrary geometries with scaffold properties in the range of the innate extracellular matrix. In addition, these scaffolds were shown to support endothelial cell growth. Therefore, we illustrate the development and testing of a novel bioscaffold fabrication technique that may be used for many tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications, which allows for the direct printing of electrospun scaffolds into well-defined macro-scale geometries that also retain the micro-structures commonly observed in electrospun scaffolds.  © 2022 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","3D printing;

TFEPAS utilizes a non-piezoelectric metal or dielectric tuning fork to transduce the photoacoustic excitation and an optical interferometric readout to measure the amplitude of the tuning fork vibration. In particular, we have devised a solution based on Additive Manufacturing (AM) for the Absorption Detection Module (ADM). The novelty of our solution is that the ADM is entirely built monolithically by Micro-Metal Laser Sintering (MMLS) or other AM techniques to achieve easier and more cost-effective customization, extreme miniaturization of internal volumes, automatic alignment of the tuning fork with the acoustic micro-resonators, and operation at high temperature. This paper reports on preliminary experimental results achieved with ammonia at parts-per-million concentration in nitrogen to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed solution. Prospectively, the proposed TFEPAS solution appears particularly suited for hyphenation to micro-Gas Chromatography and for the analysis of complex solid and liquid traces samples, including compounds with low volatility such as illicit drugs, explosives, and persistent chemical warfare agents. © 2022 by the authors.","gas analyzer; interferometric readout; micro additive manufacturing; PAS; tuning fork","Acoustics; Ammonia; Chemical Warfare Agents; Illicit Drugs; Nitrogen; Quartz; Spectrum Analysis; Additives; Ammonia; Annealing; Chemical sensors; Cost effectiveness; Gas chromatography; Image enhancement; Interferometry; Laser heating; Mass spectrometry; Photoacoustic effect; Photoacoustic spectroscopy; Sintering; Ultrasonic applications; ammonia; chemical warfare agent; nitrogen; silicon dioxide; Detection modules; Dielectric tuning; Gas analyzers; Interferometric readout; Interferometrics; Micro additive manufacturing; PAS; Piezoelectric; Tuning-fork; Vapor sensing; acoustics; chemistry; procedures; spectroscopy; 3D printers","","ammonia, 14798-03-9, 51847-23-5, 7664-41-7; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; silicon dioxide, 10279-57-9, 14464-46-1, 14808-60-7, 15468-32-3, 60676-86-0, 7631-86-9; Ammonia, ; Chemical Warfare Agents, ; Illicit Drugs, ; Nitrogen, ; Quartz, ","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (883116); Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR","This research has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 883116, and from the Italian Ministry of Education University and Research under the Project ARS01_00305 Rafael.","Kosterev A.A., Bakhirkin Y.A., Curl R.F., Tittel F.K., Quartz-enhanced photoacoustic spectroscopy, Opt.

It is also significantly important that educational institutes be focused on tracking and improving the academic performance of each student. Thus, it is important to identify the key factors (i.e., diverse backgrounds, behaviors, etc.) that help students perform well. However, the increasing number of students makes it challenging and leaves a negative impact on credibility and resources due to the high dropout rates. Researchers tend to work on a variety of statistical and machine learning techniques for predicting student performance without giving much importance to their spatial and behavioral factors. Therefore, there is a need to develop a method that considers weighted key factors which have an impact on their performance. To achieve this, we first surveyed by considering experts’ opinions in selecting weighted key factors using the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM). Secondly, a geospatial-based machine learning technique was developed which integrated the relationship between students’ location-based features, semester-wise behavioral features, and academic features. Three different experiments were conducted to prove the superiority and predict student performance. The experimental results reveal that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) achieved higher accuracy of 90.9% as compared to other machine learning methods, for instance, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Decision Tree (DT). Scientific analysis techniques (i.e., Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM)) and machine learning feature engineering techniques (i.e., Variance Threshold (VT)) were used in two different experiments for selecting features where scientific analysis techniques had achieved better accuracy. The finding of this research is that, along with the past performance and social status key factors, the semester behavior factors have a lot of impact on students’ performance. We performed spatial statistical analysis on our dataset in the context of Pakistan, which provided us with the spatial areas of students’ performance; furthermore, their results are described in the data analysis section. © 2022 by the authors.","Educational Data Mining; Fuzzy Delphi Method; higher education; predictive modeling; spatial analysis; student performance","","","","","","Higher Education Commission, Pakistan, HEC, (NRPU-10537); Higher Education Commission, Pakistan, HEC","This research study is funded by Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan.

Among them is polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which users usually cannot distinguish from other, unproblematic plastics. Therefore, an identification system for PVC applicable in a low-cost laser cutter has been developed. For the first time, this approach makes use of the laser-ablative sound generated by a low-power laser diode. Using a capacitor microphone, a preprocessing algorithm and a very simple neural network, black PVC could be detected with absolute reliability under ideal conditions. With ambient noise, the accuracy dropped to 80%. A different color of the material did not influence the accuracy to detect PVC, but a susceptibility of the method against a color change was found for other materials. The ablation characteristics for different materials were recorded using a fast-framing camera to get a better insight into the mechanisms behind the investigated process. Although there is still potential for improvements, the presented method was found to be promising to enhance the safety of future desktop laser cutters. © 2022 by the authors.","laser acoustic; laser cutting; neural network; plastics; polymer classification; safety; sorting","Chlorine compounds; Costs; Elastomers; Laser materials processing; Laser safety; Desktop lasers; Laser cutters; Laser cutting; Laser-acoustics; Low power laser; Low-cost lasers; Neural-networks; Polymer classification; Rapid prototyping tool; Simple++; Polyvinyl chlorides","","","","","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (13N15206); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF","This research was funded by the Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (German Federal Ministry of Education and Research), grant number 13N15206.","Zheng Y., Bai J., Xu J., Li X., Zhang Y., A discrimination model in waste plastics sorting using NIR hyperspectral imaging system, Waste Manag, 72, pp. 87-98, (2018); Xia J., Huang Y., Li Q., Xiong Y., Min S., Convolutional neural network with near-infrared spectroscopy for plastic discrimination, Environ.

The results show that the tulip flame transforms from an existence to a disappearance with increasing oxygen fraction. The increasing brightness of the flame indicates that the increase in oxygen fraction can enhance the explosion strength and accelerate flame propagation. A clear backward motion of the burnt gas is clearly distinguished in the direct imaging of flame propagations. The propane effect is discernible when the flame evolves in a dynamic manner shortly after the flame skirt is in touch with the sidewalls. Moreover, the oxygen fraction impacts the extent of this dynamic feature and thus the magnitude of the propane effect. The laminar burning velocity SL can be singled out to forecast the flame propagation speed. The propane effect on SL and [H+OH+O]max gradually strengthens with increasing oxygen enrichment. [H+OH+O]max is well related to the fundamental properties of the mixture, such as SL, the expansion ratio, initial temperature and flame thickness, which in turn dominate flame propagations in the duct. © 2022 The Institution of Chemical Engineers","Biogas; Laminar burning velocity; Oxygen-enriched explosion; Propane co-firing","Biogas; Combustion; Ducts; Flammability; Oxygen; Propane; Burnt gas; Co-firing; Direct imaging; Explosion characteristics; Flame propagation; Laminar burning velocity; Oxygen fractions; Oxygen-enriched; Oxygen-enriched explosion; Propane co-firing; Explosions","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51674104, 51874120)","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51674104, 51874120 ).","Abbasi-Atibeh E., Bergthorson J.M., Differential diffusion effects in counter-flow premixed hydrogen-enriched methane and propane flames, Proc.

The ICALAB for Image Processing method is one of the solutions proposed for the blind efficient separation of signals without prior knowledge of the source images. Nevertheless, to choose the appropriate algorithm with the most efficient separation index, several tests are carried out on a certain number of algorithms, with off-line processing of image samples bases, by means of software tools which are generally installed on a computer, such as ICALAB, TIPICA, GIFT, NMFLAB, model identification UBSS, ... Thus, in order to perform the image separation processing in real time, this study aims to develop a rapid prototyping embedded system for implementing the blind source separation concept. It mainly provides a promising approach for implementing twelve efficient blind image separation algorithms on the ZYBO Z7 FPGA board, using Xilinx System Generator (XSG) for Real Time Hardware Co-simulation. As an application example, this study deals with the blind separation of two e-frames mixture, and then provides the adequate algorithm, basing on the calculation of the Performance Index (PI), and the separated images results. © 2022 Authors.

In this study, we have developed a spinal cord-like bioprinted scaffold loading with OSMI-4, a small molecule O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) inhibitor, to induce and guide the neuron differentiation of NSCs for efficient SCI repair. To achieve this, we developed a supramolecular bioink (SM bioink) consisting of methacrylated gelatin and acrylated β-cyclodextrins to load NSCs and OSMI-4. This bioink showed fast gelation and stable mechanical properties, facilitating bioprinting of functional neural scaffolds. Moreover, the weak host-guest cross-linking of the SM scaffolds significantly improved the cell-matrix interaction for the infiltration and migration of NSCs. What's more, the sustained delivery of OSMI-4 remarkably enhanced the intrinsic neuronal differentiation of the encapsulated NSCs in vitro by inhibiting Notch signaling pathway. In vivo experiment further revealed that the functional bioprinted scaffolds promoted the neuronal regeneration and axonal growth, leading to significant locomotor recovery of the SCI model rats. Together, the NSC-laden bioprinted SM scaffolds in combination with sustained release of the therapeutic agent OSMI-4 largely induced neuronal differentiation of NSCs and thus leading to efficient SCI repair. Statement of significance: Efficient neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) under the complex pathological microenvironment of spinal cord injury (SCI) is a major challenge of neural regeneration. By the use of a supramolecular bioink, we bioprinted a spinal cord-like scaffold loaded with NSCs and a small molecule drug OSMI-4 to significantly induce neuronal differentiation of NSCs for efficient SCI repair in vivo. The scaffolds with spinal cord-like structure can support the interaction and neuronal differentiation of NSCs by providing a dynamic matrix and a source of molecular release of OSMI-4. The influences of OSMI-4 on NSCs and its molecular mechanism were investigated for the first time in this study. Altogether, three-dimensional bioprinting fabrication of NSC- and small molecule drug-laden biomimetic construct may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for SCI repair. © 2022 Acta Materialia Inc.","3D bioprinting; Neural stem cells; Neuronal differentiation; O-GlcNAc transferase inhibitor; Spinal cord injury repair","Animals; beta-Cyclodextrins; Cell Differentiation; Delayed-Action Preparations; Gelatin; Hydrogels; N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases; Neural Stem Cells; Rats; Spinal Cord; Spinal Cord Injuries; Spinal Cord Regeneration; Tissue Scaffolds; Biomechanics; Biomimetics; Controlled drug delivery; Cytology; Gelation; Hydrogels; Molecules; Neurons; Patient rehabilitation; Scaffolds; Scaffolds (biology); Stem cells; Supramolecular chemistry; Targeted drug delivery; Tissue regeneration; acrylic acid; beta cyclodextrin; cyclosporine; gelatin; gelfoam; hydrogel; n acetylglucosaminyltransferase; osmi 4; penicillin derivative; pentobarbital; transferase inhibitor; unclassified drug; beta cyclodextrin derivative; gelatin; O-GlcNAc transferase; 3d bioprinting; Bioprinting; Neural stem cell; Neuronal differentiation; O-glcnac transferase inhibitor; Small-molecule drugs; Spinal cord injury; Spinal cord injury repair; Spinal-cord; Supramolecular hydrogels; acylation; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; biocompatibility; biomechanics; cell infiltration; cell matrix interaction; cell migration; controlled study; cross linking; cytotoxicity; flaccid paralysis; immunocytochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; inflammation; locomotion; male; nanoencapsulation; nerve cell differentiation; nerve fiber regeneration; nerve regeneration; neural stem cell; neurofilament; nonhuman; Notch signaling; quantitative analysis; rat; spinal cord injury; spinal cord transsection; sustained drug release; three dimensional bioprinting; animal; cell differentiation; chemistry; delayed release formulation; hydrogel; metabolism; pathology; pharmacology; spinal cord; spinal cord injury; spinal cord regeneration; tissue scaffold; Repair","","acrylic acid, 10344-93-1, 79-10-7; beta cyclodextrin, 7585-39-9; cyclosporine, 59865-13-3, 63798-73-2, 79217-60-0; gelatin, 9000-70-8; n acetylglucosaminyltransferase, 9054-49-3; pentobarbital, 57-33-0, 76-74-4; beta-Cyclodextrins, ; Delayed-Action Preparations, ; Gelatin, ; Hydrogels, ; N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases, ; O-GlcNAc transferase, ","","","Construction Project of Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Pharmaceutical Intelligent Equipment, (20DZ2255900); Suzhou Basic Research Pilot Project, (SJC2021011); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (32171367); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (XDA16020100); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","This work was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA16020100), National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 32171367 ), Suzhou Basic Research Pilot Project (SJC2021011), the Construction Project of Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Pharmaceutical Intelligent Equipment (20DZ2255900) and Shanghai Frontiers Science Research Center for Druggability of Cardiovascular noncoding RNA.

As a result, it is critical to achieve acceptable water quality while also reducing the organic and inorganic impurities. Potable water production methods have been developed and tested in various ways. It is possible to manufacture high-quality drinking water using nanofiltration (NF) membranes. In contrast, fouling has remained the most significant barrier to membrane technology advancement. Renewable energy sources may decrease the extra energy needed by a membrane with tiny holes. Recent years have seen a significant increase in interest in three-dimensional printing (3D printing [3D-P]). Surface imprinting technologies, in general, have not yet reached the maturity stage of development, notably in membrane design and production. It is discussed in this review article how different 3D printing technologies are now accessible, how they relate to current breakthroughs in the area, and how they may be used to fabricate nanosheets, module spacers, or thin layers design for water purification as well as potential applications of surface imprinting in the near future. It is anticipated that the revolutionary synthesis of novel membrane module components will occur in the near future due to recent breakthroughs in 3D-P technology. It is predicted that 3D-P technologies would create a broader range of membrane module components with improved efficacy and efficiency due to speed, materials, and resolution improvements. Water purification methods comprising membrane separation are potential applications that might benefit from surface imprinting patterns with complicated topography in the future for water purification among them. © 2022","3D printing; High surface area; Nanofiltration (NF) membranes; Photodegradation; Pollutants; Water purification","","","","","","Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2020B090923002); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2019B1515130005)","This research is financially supported by the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (Grant No. 2019B1515130005 ) and the Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province (Grant No. 2020B090923002 ).","Park J.K., Zhang Y., Xu B., Kim S., Pattern transfer of large-scale thin membranes with controllable self-delamination interface for integrated functional systems, Nat.

Despite the significant advances in material range and machine capabilities, the lack of process stability and repeatability of ME still represents an obstacle for the adoption of this process on large industrial scales. Following the success of in-situ monitoring in other AM technologies, some studies are investigating the possibility of embedding in-situ sensors on commercial machines. Among them, thermal infrared monitoring systems have gained lots of interest for the crucial role of temperature evolution in final part quality and mechanical performance. This study presents a data-driven methodology for in-situ monitoring of thermal profiles. The proposed algorithm extracts, models, and compares the cooling history at different locations. By combining a tracking algorithm and automatic detection of region of interests and robust regression for functional data modeling, we propose a solution to study the cooling history of the 3D printed geometry as the process evolves, to draw general conclusions on the process and detect anomalous thermal profiles, which may entail lack of bonding or other flaws. This paper further proposes a novel approach to automatically detect local temperature inhomogeneities, also known as “hot” and “cold spots”, which are often symptomatic of critical defects in the 3D printed part. In-situ detection of hold- and cold-spots can be particularly useful for large scale products or functional products printing. The proposed methods can be applied to any ME process, but it is specifically applied to a real case study of Big Area Additive Manufacturing (BAAM), in collaboration with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Results show the effectiveness of all the proposed solutions and pave the way towards zero-defects production. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Big Area Additive Manufacturing; Composites; Extrusion additive manufacturing; In-situ monitoring; Thermography","Additives; Defects; Extrusion; Monitoring; Big area additive manufacturing; Cold spots; Cooling history; Extrusion additive manufacturing; Extrusion process; In-situ monitoring; Thermal; Thermal profiles; Thermography; Video imaging; 3D printers","","","","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL","The present research was partially supported by “PROGETTO ROBERTO ROCCA”.

The external disturbance from the space environment and modeled/unmodeled uncertainties are aggregated as a lumped unknown external disturbance. A novel NDO is designed to provide an estimation of unknown external disturbance. The adaptive robust control approach is combined with the NDO-based control approach to get a composite adaptive controller. In the resulting controller, the disturbance estimation is utilized as feed-forward to attenuate the disturbance effects. The asymptotic stability of the proposed composite adaptive controller is proved using the Lyapunov theorem. In previous NDO-based controllers designed for nonlinear systems, either the time derivative of external disturbance is assumed to be equal to zero, or the knowledge of external disturbance upper-bound is required to be known. However, the proposed controller neither makes presumption on the magnitude of the disturbance nor its time derivatives. Furthermore, compared with some existing NDO-based controllers, the conditions of previous methods on the magnitudes of controller parameters are relaxed. Simulation results, along with comparisons, are included to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. Compared to the previous NDO-based control methods, the proposed method provides better tracking performance in the presence of external disturbances, besides relaxing the restrictions of previous NDO control methods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Adaptive robust control; Asymptotic tracking control; Composite adaptive control; Nonlinear disturbance observer; Spacecraft formation flying","Asymptotic stability; Controllers; Navigation; Robust control; Spacecraft propulsion; Adaptive Control; Adaptive robust control; Asymptotic tracking control; Composite adaptive control; Disturbance observer; Disturbance-observer-based controls; External disturbances; Nonlinear disturbance; Nonlinear disturbance observer; Spacecraft formation flying; Adaptive control systems","","","","","","","Scharf D.P., Keim J.A., Hadaegh F.Y., Flight-like ground demonstrations of precision maneuvers for spacecraft formations.

Here we focus on the crucial, though often neglected, role of the layer thickness on photopolymerization. The temporal evolution of polymerization reactions occurring in droplets of acrylate-based oligomers and in photoresist films with varied thickness is investigated by means of an optical system, which is specifically designed for in-situ and real-time monitoring. The time needed for complete curing is found to increase as the polymerization volume is decreased below a characteristic threshold that depends on the specific reaction pathway. This behavior is rationalized by modeling the process through a size-dependent polymerization rate. Our study highlights that the formation of photopolymerized networks might be affected by the involved volumes regardless of the specific curing mechanisms, which could play a crucial role in optimizing photocuring-based additive manufacturing. © 2022 The Authors","Light scattering; Optically transparent materials; Photopolymerization; Process monitoring; Vat photopolymerization","3D printers; Curing; Laser beams; Optical systems; Photopolymerization; Photoresists; Process monitoring; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Light exposure; Optical monitoring; Optically transparent material; Photo polymerization; Printing technologies; Sizes effect; Vat photopolymerization; Light scattering","","","","","Italian Minister of University and Research; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; European Research Council, ERC; Horizon 2020, (682157)","Funding text 1: The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (Grant agreement No. 682157, “xPRINT”) and from the Italian Minister of University and Research PRIN 2017PHRM8X project (“3D-Phys”).

In this paper, an austenitic stainless steel (ASS) and low carbon steel (LCS) bimetallic structure based on a single pass multi-layer model was deposited through WAAM by utilizing a cold metal transfer welding process. Furthermore, the bimetallic structure was subjected to several analyses to study its microstructure and mechanical properties. The finding shows the Ferrite-Austenite model in the ASS part. The microstructure of ASS revealed vermicular δ-ferrite, while LCS revealed an acicular and polygonal ferrite morphology. A sharp increase in the microhardness was observed at the interface of the bimetallic structure. The tensile strength and % elongation of the bimetallic structure reached 493 MPa and 22%, respectively, while the fracture occurred at the LCS side, indicating strong mechanical bonding and toughness at the interface of the bimetallic structure. © 2022, ASM International.","Additive manufacturing; Bimetallic; CMT; WAAM","Additives; Austenitic stainless steel; Ferrite; Low carbon steel; Microstructure; Morphology; Tensile strength; Bimetallic structures; Bimetallics; CMT; Low-carbon steels; Manufacturing IS; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Steels carbons; Structure-based; Wire arc; Wire arc additive manufacturing; 3D printers","","","","","","","F2792-12a-Standard Terminology for Additive Manufacturing Technologies, Rapid Manuf Assoc, pp. 10-12, (2013); Ivanova O., Williams C., Campbell T., Additive Manufacturing (AM) and Nanotechnology: Promises and Challenges, Rapid Prototype J., 19, pp. 353-364, (2013); Ding D., Pan Z., Cuiuri D., Li H., Wire-Feed Additive Manufacturing of Metal Components: Technologies, Developments and Future Interests, Int.

Without a business-appropriate performance-measurement system, practitioners devise strategies that are neither scientific nor supported by data. The objective of this paper was to propose a performance-measurement system to support the enabling of supply-chain strategies. The proposed performance-measurement system (PMS), combining the Plan–Do–Check–Act cycle (PDCA) with the evidence-based management (EBM) concept, served as the basis for developing a procedural framework. The PMS was validated using the case logistics service providers (LSPs). The PDCA methodology was used to develop a structural framework for fourth-party logistics (4PL). In the Plan step, the research team identified the business problems of fourth-party logistics (4PL). In the Do step, the LSP literature was reviewed, to identify five performance dimensions (‘Service Quality’; ‘Social and Environmental’; ‘Inter-organizational Relationship’; ‘Financial’; and ‘Efficiency and Effectiveness’), and key performance indicators (KPIs). The 4PL management team participated in the finalization of the five performance dimensions and the 53 KPIs, which were used to propose a preliminary version of the structural framework for the 4PL. In the Check step, the data collected from 478 subcontractors of the 4PL were analyzed, using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling, and were used to validate the proposed structural framework for the 4PL. The validated structural framework was further presented at an academic conference, and to the 4PL for feedback, and was used to formulate supply-chain strategies through brainstorming. The findings include a validated structural framework containing five performance dimensions and 32 KPIs. The research revealed that input performance (‘Service Quality’, ‘Social and Environmental’, and ‘Inter-organizational Relationship’) positively affected output performance (‘Financial’ and ‘Efficiency and Effectiveness’). Supply-chain strategies were further suggested to the 4PL. The validating case in this study demonstrated that the employed procedural framework (PDCA and EBM) was applicable, and could be used to derive a structural framework and supply-chain strategies for the 4PL. This study contributes to the literature, by proposing a PMS for supply-chain strategy development. The paper’s illustrative case provides a practical application of how to develop a performance-measurement system. © 2022 by the authors.","evidence-based management; logistics service providers; performance-measurement system; the PDCA cycle","business; factor analysis; management practice; performance assessment; research work; service quality; strategic approach; supply chain management","","","","","National Research Council of Thailand, NRCT, (PHD59I0035); Rangeland Research Institute, University of Alberta, RRI","Funding text 1: The authors gratefully acknowledge their funding from RRI and NRCT. ; Funding text 2: The research was funded by the Research and Researcher for Industry (RRI); grant operated under the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT): PHD59I0035.
