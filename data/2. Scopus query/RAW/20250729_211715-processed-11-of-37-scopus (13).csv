Extra-large area and flexible lighting elements with embedded light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are an example of such applications. LEDs can be used, for example, as light sources, to create smart surfaces for the architectural or automotive industry. Once the LEDs are embedded into the structure, they cannot be replaced. To make sustainable HSE products with long lifetime, the new type of designs is needed. The elements of HSE undergo conditions with elevated thermal stresses while in operation. That is known to have an impact on their performance and lifetime, thus making a proper heat management of the LED crucial. Due to the novel additive manufacturing methods, structures, and unconventional material combinations, many thermal management related aspects are not known. In this study, a two-step hybrid method, including thermal modeling and measurements, is used to estimate the thermal behavior of a surface-mounted LED on polymer substrate used in HSE. The model is created and simulated in COMSOL Multiphysics. The validity and accuracy of the model's thermal behavior are verified through measurements with thermal transient measurements. Based on the experimental verification, the proposed simulation model only has small (less than 2%) temperature variations when compared with measurements. Hence, the developed model can be used as a basis for designing structural LED elements and predicting their performance characteristics in different user cases. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Hybrid electronics (HE); junction temperature; lifetime; model verification; printed electronics","3D printers; Comsol multiphysics; Experimental verification; Hybrid thermal model; Material combination; Performance characteristics; Temperature variation; Thermal transient measurements; Two-step hybrid methods; Light emitting diodes","","","","","Suomen Akatemia, (320017); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (A74080)","Manuscript received July 14, 2020; revised November 3, 2020; accepted November 23, 2020.

Here, a novel coaxial electrohydrodynamic (EHD) bioprinting strategy is presented to fabricate thick pre-vascularized cell-laden constructs. The alginate and collagen/calcium chloride solution were utilized as the outer-layer and inner-layer bioink, respectively, in the coaxial printing nozzle to produce the core-sheath hydrogel filaments. The effect of process parameters (the feeding rate of alginate and collagen and the moving speed of the printing stage) on the size of core and sheath lines within the printed filaments was investigated. The core-sheath filaments were printed in the predefined pattern to fabricate lattice hydrogel with perfusable lumen structures. Endothelialized lumen structures were fabricated by culturing the core-sheath filaments with endothelial cells laden in the core collagen hydrogel. Multilayer core-sheath filaments were successfully printed into 3D porous hydrogel constructs with a thickness of more than 3 mm. Finally, 3D pre-vascularized cardiac constructs were successfully generated, indicating the efficacy of our strategy to engineer living tissues with complex vascular structures. © 2021 Mao, et al.

The trust-related issue in multiclouds includes more complicated content and new problems. A new trust management framework for multicloud environments is proposed in this article. The proposed framework used a combination of objective and subjective trust values to calculate the cloud service provider's trust values. This new framework can identify and rectify fake feedbacks from other feedbacks. Another advantage of this framework is applying fuzzy rules to calculate trust values. Two main components of the proposed framework are simulated in this paper. The simulation results confirm the important role of applied components. Also, this paper proposed a framework compared with other frameworks (feedback-based model, SLA-based model, and multicloud model). Simulation results show the proposed framework increased trust values rather than other models. Also, compared with other models, our framework gives better mean trust values.  © 2021 Mona Soleymani et al.","","Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy rules; Cloud service providers; Computational problem; Feed-back based;

Hydrodynamic coefficients that describe the fluid-structure interaction and the wave transfer functions are obtained by applying linear potential theory. The results obtained from the hydrodynamic analysis are combined with a beam model of the bridge in a finite element method (FEM) framework to enable stochastic response prediction through the power spectral density method. The standard deviations of the predicted accelerations are compared with the standard deviations of the measured accelerations, and the overall quality of the prediction model is discussed. Predictions with sea states related to the serviceability limit state (SLS) and ultimate limit state (ULS) conditions used in design of the bridge are emphasized. To investigate the behaviour more in depth, a measurement segment is chosen and predictions of the displacement response power spectral density due to excitation characterized by the recorded sea surface elevation are compared with those obtained from the corresponding response measurements. A decent agreement is obtained for both cases when using the model as it is and with waves as the only excitation source, but significant discrepancies are present, in particular, for the torsional components. By including preliminary contributions from wind action and relying on a model optimized against measured modal parameters, a satisfactory agreement is obtained. The effect on the response of an uncertain structural damping is also quantified and concluded to be significant within realistic damping levels.  © 2021 Knut Andreas Kvåle and Ole Øiseth.","","Bridges;

However, balancing the capacitor voltage becomes complex when the number of sub modules is increased. In a conventional system, for balancing a capacitor voltage, separate monitoring and control are required for each sub module, which further increases the cost and burden to the converter. This paper proposes a simplified logical method (SLM) for balancing the capacitor voltage of each sub module without any additional sensors and controllers. The capacitor voltage of N sub modules is balanced based on the simple logical function, which eventually balances the capacitor voltage and thus reduces the voltage ripple of each capacitor. In addition, this method suppresses the circulating current and common mode voltage, which increases the efficiency and cost effective of the converter. The level shifted carrier technique is used for providing desired pulse signals for the switching devices in the converter. The effective performances of the proposed method are validated using simulation and experimental setup.  © 2013 IEEE.","capacitor voltage balancing; HVDC applications; modular multilevel converter (MMC); phase logic method; Simplified logical method (SLM)","Cost effectiveness; Voltage scaling; Balancing techniques; Circulating current; Common mode voltage; Conventional systems; Effective performance; Modular multilevel converters; Modular structures; Monitoring and control; Power converters","","","","","Al Saberah Energy Company","This work was supported by Al Saberah Energy Company, Saudi Arabia.","Salem A., Van Khang H., Robbersmyr K.G., Norambuena M., Rodriguez J., Voltage source multilevel inverters with reduced device count: Topological review and novel comparative factors, IEEE Trans.

This study considers the possibility of manufacturing technological plugs for engine box and oil system using additive technologies. The cover plugs were printed using the Fusion Deposition Modeling (FDM) method on a Russian-made ZENIT printer. PLA plastic was chosen for 3D printing. The plug models were optimised, which allowed correcting and reducing the estimated printing time. In particular, some plugs were made assemblable, which helped to avoid a large number of printing supports. The production of technological plugs using additive technology allows reducing the cost of the finished product, the weight of the plugs and the estimated time of their production. © 2021.

The effect of O2 content on arc wandering was assessed by analyzing cathodic spot behavior through high-speed videography during Gas metal arc (GMA-AM) depositions. Superficial and geometric aspects were analyzed, as well as the sputtering zone width on the wall sides. Through a proposed model, a parallel effect of wire-introduced oxides was weighted to explain arc wandering, searching for oxides in the wall sides (deviating from its action only on the pool). The main finding was that no influence of O2 from the shielding gas was observed on arc wandering, consequently on layer formation, when its content was up to 200 ppm. When an O2 content of 20,000 ppm was employed, oxide searching by the arc in the wall sides was no longer perceived due to enough oxide availability from the shielding gas. However, this favorable condition to layer formation entailed excessive layer oxidation. From the cathodic emission point of view, it can be said that high-purity shielding gases or special mixtures with small additions of O2 (up to 200 ppm) provide no significant advantages for WAAM of aluminum thin walls, at least for the hereby tested alloy and parameters. © 2021 CIRP","Aluminum alloys; Arc wandering; Cathodic emission; WAAM","3D printers; Aluminum; Argon; Gas metal arc welding; Shielding; Video recording; Cathodic emissions; Favorable conditions; Gas metal arcs; High purity; High speed videography; Layer formation; Shielding gas; Thin walls; Gases","","","","","Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel ?; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Universidade Federal de Uberlândia, UFU; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (302863/2016-8, 315092/2018-1)","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank Center for Research and Development of Welding Processes of the Federal University of Uberlandia (Laprosolda-UFU) for the laboratory infrastructure and technical support.

The main disadvantage of the parts made by 3D Printing technologies is that they are less resistant from a mechanical point of view. This can be solved by the development of 3D printers capable of printing composite parts consisting of a plastic matrix reinforced with continuous fibers. This research focuses on studying 4 types of 3D-printed Continuous-Fiber-Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) from the point of view of their mechanical properties: Onyx - rigid nylon in which micro carbon fibers are inserted and Onyx reinforced with carbon, glass or Kevlar fiber. Standardized specimens were made for the uniaxial tensile test and the experimental program was designed evaluating: the Elastic modulus [GPa], the Maximum Tensile stress [MPa], the Tensile strain at maximum Tensile stress [mm/mm]. The principal strains were also determined, using the digital image technique made using the Aramis system from GOM. The experimental tests confirm that these new materials will be serious candidates to be used in engineering applications in various fields. © 2021 Syscom 18 SRL.

In this paper, an efficient angle-range dependent DFRC system is proposed using frequency diverse array (FDA)-multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) configuration. We developed a closed-loop design that improves the tracking task of the system and permits a cognitive selection for an optimum signaling strategy towards the intended communication receiver during each scan. We used two information embedding schemes, a proposed amplitude phase shift keying (APSK) and phase-shift keying (PSK), that utilize either the magnitude ratios and/or phase shifts between the radar waveform pairs towards the communication direction. Hence, the communication link is maintained and the system throughput is enhanced. The simulation results verify that the communication performance is enhanced in terms of low symbol error rate (SER), secure information transmission, and increased throughput, while for radar applications the performance is improved in terms of target detection and parameter estimation. It also showed that the proposed symbol mapping APSK scheme provides a high data rate transmission compared to the existing SL-based information embedding schemes while preserving a low bit error rate (BER). Besides, the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) for range and angle estimation and the signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) for the proposed DFRC system are analyzed.  © 2013 IEEE.","frequency diverse array; joint radar-communication; Radar signal processing; radio spectrum management","Cognitive systems; Cramer-Rao bounds; Embeddings; MIMO systems; Phase shift; Phase shift keying; Radar; Radar target recognition; Signal to noise ratio; Amplitude-phase-shift keying; Communication performance; Communication receivers; High data rate transmission; Information transmission; Multiple input multiple output configurations; Signal to interference-noise ratios; Symbol error rate (SER); Bit error rate","","","","","","","Griffiths H., Blunt S., Cohen L., Savy L., Challenge problems in spectrum engineering and waveform diversity, Proc.

The effect of alumina from different sources of SCMs was considered to activate the formation of carboaluminates. Ternary blends with 50% ordinary portland cement clinker, 45% blends of limestone calcined clay (LC2) in 1:2 blend and slag limestone blend (SLS) in 2:1 mix proportion with 5% of gypsum were studied. The hydration behaviour was analysed based on cement mortar compressive strength, heat of hydration using an isothermal calorimeter and bound water measured using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). In addition, the degree of hydration of clinker phases and the composition of calcium-alumino-silicate-hydrate (C-A-S-H) gels forming in two different systems were compared on 90 days hydrated samples analysed using X-Ray diffractometry (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) respectively. The results show a rapid early strength development in limestone calcined clay cement blend (LC3) but a lower clinker hydration in comparison with slag limestone cement blend (SLSC) at later ages. In both the cement blends the formation of hemicarboaluminate (Hc) and monocarboaluminate (Mc) was confirmed at 90 days, but the conversion of Hc to Mc was higher in SLSC. Results further confirmed a lower degree of hydration and higher alumina incorporation in the C-A-S-H gel in the LC3 comparison to SLSC. The presence of calcium hydroxide was also confirmed in the SLSC blend due to the hydraulic nature of slag that supported the later age conversion of Hc to Mc as not seen in LC3. © The Author(s) 2021.","Carboaluminate; Hydration; LC<sup>3</sup>; Slag limestone cement","","","","","","Direktion für Entwicklung und Zusammenarbeit, DEZA; University of Sheffield","The sponsorship of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation is acknowledged for this work.

In the last few years, technologies such as additive manufacturing are becoming more common for gas turbine applications, allowing greater flexibility in the design space. There is now a drive to fully exploit this flexibility and to design and validate new parts in a digital envir-onment. This work shows how optimization methods, mainly based on topology optimization strategies, can be used to fulfil these needs. Full digitalisation of the process has the potential to generate completely new designs, not based on past solutions. However, this requires more accurate estimators for critical applications, such as the high temperature components of high-pressure stages, in order to be sure that the solution is feasible and reliable. Recent development of Machine Learning methodologies is enabling estimators with greater accuracy to be produced. In particular the introduction of data driven modelling is able to leverage the results from high fidelity simulations, such as DNS, to enrich the RANS estimator in fluid topology optimization. In this work, a comparison of recent results associated to Gene Expression Programming and Neural Networks in topology optimization are shown. Finally an innovative strategy for Topology Optimization based on Deep Neural Networks is presented, opening new possibilities for the design of next generation gas turbines. © 2021 Montomoli et al.","Additive manufacturing; Industry 4.0; Machine learning; Topology optimization","","","","","","","","Alvarez de Toledo Ortiz E., RANS Turbulence Model Development using clustering and artificial neural networks, (2020); Bendsoe M.

In a wireless system, the transmitted signals are scattered from the different objects and thus subjected to multi-path fading, which leads to degrade the system performance in terms of spectral efficiency, throughput or capacity, and quality of services (QoS). In this article, maximal-ratio-combining (MRC) diversity at the receiver to improve capacity and signal quality is proposed. A comparative approach between various PAPR reduction schemes like iterative clipping and filtering (ICF), partial transmit sequence (PTS) and selective mapping (SLM) is also presented. The simulation is performed using QPSK modulation, 128 subcarriers, the over-sampling factor of 8. The results indicate that MRC at the receiver gives better BER performance than the conventional method and the proposed ICF method achieves the best level of PAPR reduction using a minimum number of iterations.

Stadium Ave., West Lafayette, 47907, IN, United States","The qualification of engineering materials requires extensive testing of the time-dependent performance of the material, namely the fatigue behavior. Model-based approaches for determining the fatigue behavior have presented a tangible step towards complementing and reducing the overall number of physical tests necessary to qualify a material for use in application. Yet, prior to the adoption of the model-based approaches, the model needs to be thoroughly validated, presenting challenges, including substantiating the model's ability to capture the correct physics for crack initiation, which is difficult provided the multiple length-scales of the problem. In this paper, a methodology and demonstration for validating the location of microstructure-sensitive fatigue crack initiation as predicted by crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) simulations, using high-energy X-ray diffraction and tomography experiments are presented. Realistic 3D microstructural models are created for the material of interest, IN718 (produced via additive manufacturing), with different twin instantiations, based on the experimental data for use in the CPFE simulations. The location of failure predicted using the extreme values of failure metrics (plastic strain accumulation and plastic strain energy density) resulted in an unambiguous one-to-one correlation with the experimentally observed location of crack-initiation for the models with statistical twin instantiations. © 2020 The Authors","High cycle fatigue (HCF); High-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy (HEDM); Microstructure-based modeling; Model validation; Selective laser melting","3D printers; Crack initiation; Cracks; Crystals; Fatigue crack propagation; Location; Microstructure; Plastic deformation; Plasticity; Strain energy; Welds; Crystal plasticity finite element; Engineering materials; Fatigue crack initiation; High energy x-ray diffraction; Microstructural models; Model based approach; Plastic strain energy density; Time-dependent performance; Fatigue of materials","","","","","Office of Basic Energy Sciences; US Department of Energy; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, (N66001-14-1-4041); Office of Science, SC; Basic Energy Sciences, BES, (DE-AC02-06CH11357); Argonne National Laboratory, ANL; Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL","Funding text 1: The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from DARPA ( N66001-14-1-4041 ) under program managers M.

It has been further proposed that creative outcomes are limited by the imagination of the designer: designers are often asked to take full advantage of the new design potentials given by AM, yet without having the supports that are needed to increase their creativity. Current literature focuses neither on supporting creative perspectives in Design for AM (DfAM) nor on how to manage the higher degree of design freedom that can be present. As a consequence of this noticeable gap in the literature, this paper continue to explore what areas that need to be considered in creativity management, to fully support designers in utilising their creative abilities in relation to AM in design. The paper proceeds through a literature study on creativity in DfAM and presents a case study with experienced designers who are just starting to work with AM in their design practices. This paper contributes to the field with the notion of a creativity layer laid upon DfAM, visualized by three characteristics of creativity (expertise, creative thinking skills and motivation) drawn from previous research. This results in three concrete propositions of areas that need to be considered in future research on how to include a creativity management perspective in DfAM. © 2021 The Author(s).

The main design drive of the modified re-entrant cavity is to confine the electric field and therefore enhance the interaction with the material under test while maintaining high quality factor of the cavity. This enables high sensitivity when measuring complex permittivity of low loss materials. The fabrication of the resonator was made easy by using stereo-lithography (SLA) 3D printing. The measured resonance frequency of the fabricated cavity is 2.09 GHz and the quality factor is 5250. The device was first validated using several common solvents. A unified analytical perturbation model based on simulations is developed for the extraction of the complex permittivity. The influence of the dielectric constant on the loss-tangent model has been fully taken into account. Results obtained agree very well with literature values. The device has subsequently been used in the measurement of crude oil samples and the correlation between permittivity measurement and crude oil category has been established. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Crude oil; Keywords: permittivity; Quality factor; Re-entrant cavity","Acoustic resonators; Crude oil; Dielectric materials; Electric fields; Microwave devices; Microwave resonators; Permittivity; Permittivity measurement; Complex permittivity; Complex permittivity measurement; Dielectric metrology; High quality factors; Material under tests; Perturbation model; Re-entrant cavities; Resonance frequencies; 3D printers","","","","","Petroleum Technology Development Fund, PTDF","This work was supported by Petroleum Development Technology Fund (PTDF), Nigeria by providing scholarship for A.M.

The multidisciplinary nature of this topic has led researchers from multiple areas of expertise such as architecture, engineering, and materials science to collaborate to improve the technology, which does not permit yet to print mixtures with coarse aggregates, but is often referred to as AM of “concrete” or “concrete” printing. An important aspect of research in the area is finding a Portland cement-based mortar with adequate rheological, hardening and strength properties for printing architectural structures. In addition, the properties of fresh and hardened mortar and its deformation behavior affect the shape accuracy of the printed geometries and require designers to adjust the toolpaths and technology to account for issues in the printing. This paper is aimed at studying the deformation of a printed concrete mix, which previous studies have shown to be printable. It is focused on the effect of the number of layers, the number of beads and time on layer height and width. It proceeds through a series of experimental tests and it uses regression analysis to model material behavior. The resulting equations can be used in toolpath design to compensate for such deformation and have more accurate printed geometries subsequently. Future studies will be concerned with linking material properties with material deformation and use results to develop a more generic toolpath generator. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","3d printing; Additive manufacturing of concrete; Cementitious material; Digital fabrication","3D printers; Additives; Aggregates; Cement manufacture; Concrete aggregates; Concrete industry; Concrete products; Deformation; Hardening; Mortar; Portland cement; Architectural structure; Cementitious materials; Coarse aggregates; Deformation behavior; Experimental test; Material deformation; Number of layers; Strength property; Concrete mixtures","","","","","Pennsylvania State University, PSU","This research was financially sponsored by The Raymond A.

The purpose of this study is to provide a new metrics based on the analysis of the compaction behavior for the evaluation of flowability of AM powders. Design/methodology/approach: In this work, a novel qualification methodology based on a camera mounted onto a commercially available tap density meter allowed to assess the compaction behavior of a selection of AM materials, both polymers and metals. This methodology automatizes the reading of the powder height and obtains more information compared to ASTM B527. A novel property is introduced, the “tapping modulus,” which describes the packing speed of a powdered material and is related to a compression/vibration powder flow. Findings: The compaction behavior was successfully correlated with the dynamic angle of repose for polymers, but interestingly not for metals, shedding more light to the different flow behavior of these materials. Research limitations/implications: Because of the chosen materials, the results may lack generalizability. For example, the application of this methodology outside of AM would be interesting. Originality/value: This paper suggests a new methodology for assessing the flowing behavior of AM materials when subjected to compression. The device is inexpensive and easy to implement in a quality assurance environment, being thus interesting for industrial applications. © 2021, Francesco Sillani, Dominik Wagner, Marvin Aaron Spurek, Lukas Haferkamp, Adriaan Bernardus Spierings, Manfred Schmid and Konrad Wegener.","Compaction; Flowability; Powder bed fusion PBF; Selective laser melting SLM; Selective laser sintering; Tap density","3D printers; Additives; Compaction; Polymers; Quality assurance; Angle of repose; Compaction behavior; Design/methodology/approach; Flow behaviors; Flowability; Polymer additive; Powdered materials; Tap density; Powder metals","","","","","","","Ali U., Mahmoodkhani Y., Shahabad S.I., Esmaeilizadeh R., Liravi F., Sheydaeian E., Huang K.Y., Marzbanrad E., Vlasea M., Toyserkani E., On the measurement of relative powder-bed compaction density in powder-bed additive manufacturing processes, Materials & Design, 155, (2018); Amado F., Characterization and prediction of SLS processability of polymer powders with respect to powder flow and part warpage, (2016); ISO/ASTM 52900 – 18: additive manufacturing terminology, (2018); ASTM B417 – 18: standard test method for apparent density of non-free-flowing metal powders using the carney funnel, (2018); ASTM B527 – 15: standard test method for tap density of metal powders and compounds, (2015); Baumann F.-E., Wilczok N., Preparation of precipitated polyamid powders of narrow particle size distribution and low porosity, (1998); Berretta S., Poly ether ether ketone (PEEK) polymers for high temperature laser sintering (HT-LS), (2015); Caffrey T., Wohler T., Wohlers Report 2019, (2019); Gotoh K., Masuda H., Higashitani K., Powder Technology Handbook, volume 10, (2001); Haferkamp L., Haudenschild L., Spierings A., Wegener K., Riener K., Ziegelmeier S., Leichtfried G.J., The influence of particle shape, powder flowability, and powder layer density on part density in laser powder bed fusion, Metals, 11, 3, (2021); Kleijnen R., Schmid M., Wegener K., Production and processing of a spherical polybutylene terephthalate powder for laser sintering, Applied Sciences, 9, 7, (2019); Kiani P., Scipioni Bertoli U., Dupuy A.D., Ma K., Schoenung J.M., A statistical analysis of powder flowability in metal additive manufacturing, Advanced Engineering Materials, 22, 10, (2020); Li R., Shi Y., Wang Z., Li W., Liu J., Jiang W., Densification behavior of gas and water atomized 316L stainless steel powder during selective laser melting, Applied Surface Science, 256, 13, (2010); Ramanujan S., Modular equations and approximations to π, Quarterly Journal of Mathematics, 45, pp. 350-372, (1914); Rietema K., The Dynamics of Fine Powders, (1991); Sames W.J., List F.A., Pannala S., Dehoff R.R., Babu S.S., The metallurgy and processing science of metal additive manufacturing, International Materials Reviews, 61, 5, pp. 315-360, (2016); Schmid M., Amado F., Wegener K., Materials perspective of polymers for additive manufacturing with selective laser sintering, Journal of Materials Research, 29, 17, pp. 1824-1832, (2014); Schmid M., Kleijnen R., Vetterli M., Wegener K., Influence of the origin of polyamide 12 powder on the laser sintering process and laser sintered parts, Applied Sciences, 7, 5, (2017); Seyda V., Werkstoff- und prozessverhalten von metallpulvern in der laseradditiven fertigung, (2018); Sillani F., Kleijnen R.G., Vetterli M., Schmid M., Wegener K., Selective laser sintering and multi jet fusion: process-induced modification of the raw materials and analyses of parts performance, Additive Manufacturing, 27, pp. 32-41, (2019); Spierings A.B., Voegtlin M., Bauer T., Wegener K., Powder flowability characterisation methodology for powder-bed-based metal additive manufacturing, Progress in Additive Manufacturing, 1, 1-2, (2016); Vetterli M., Powder optimization for laser sintering: an insight in powder intrinsic and extrinsic properties, (2019); Vock S., Kloden B., Kirchner A., Weissgarber T., Kieback B., Powders for powder bed fusion: a review, Progress in Additive Manufacturing, 4, 4, (2019); Ziegelmeier S., Wollecke F., Tuck C., Goodridge R., Hague R., Characterizing the bulk & flow behaviour of LS polymer powders, Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium, pp. 354-367, (2013)","F.

Formulation of the method is based on the curved catenary cable element which assures high accuracy of the results and enables solving wide range of problems. Essential rules of the Force Density Method (FDM) are summarized in the paper. Some well-known formula describing behaviour of a catenary cable element under self-weight are given. Next the improved variant ofFDMwith all the theoretical and numerical details is introduced. Iterative procedure for solving nonlinear equations is described. Finally a simple verification example proves correctness of methods assumptions. Two further analyses of parameters crucial for correct use of Extended Force Density Method (EFDM) are presented in order to indicate their initial values for other numerical examples. Accuracy of the results are also investigated. A computer program UC-Form was developed in order to perform the calculations and graphically present the results.

The existing sawing methods are uneconomical to produce high aspect ratio sheets with good dimensional accuracy. The current work focuses on extracting thin sheet of 380 mm × 50 mm × 0.2 mm from Ti-6Al-4V using wire electric discharge machining and investigated the dimensional and surface variations. The preliminary study using usual wire EDM procedure resulted in poor dimensional accuracy for a thickness in the range of 500 μm due to the lateral movement of sheet free end. Hence, in this work, a support system is attached to workpiece to minimise sheet movement and to improve the flushing during extraction. This helped to reduce the thickness variation up to 6% for a 0.2 mm Ti-6Al-4V sheet. The root mean square roughness is found to be consistent up to a height of 240 mm from the top surface.

However, induced soil suction restricts root water uptake when beyond a threshold (st ) and tends to stop water uptake at a limiting suction (sl ). This process is called root–soil hydraulic interactions, whose relationship with plant morphology (e.g., plant height, leaf area, and root length) is unclear. This study aims to investigate the effects of plant morphology on response of the sink term (water uptake intensity; WUI) to soil suction for Schefflera heptaphylla. Laboratory tests were conducted on 26 individuals in five different height groups. A new empirical model was derived to consider effects of plant morphology on root water uptake distribution in the full soil suction range. The locations of maximum root length density (RLD) and WUI for taller individuals were relatively deeper and farther from centreline. Before soil suction reached st, water uptake length ability (WULA) remained at a maximum level, positively related to LR ratio (ratio between leaf area, LA, and root length, RL), but less affected by plant height. For taller plants, the decreasing rate of st with LR ratio was larger, while the decreasing rate of WULA with soil suction beyond st appeared smaller. sl appeared independent of height, LA, and RL. © 2021, Canadian Science Publishing.

A computer-aided reverse engineering system (CARE System) was applied to minimize file errors generated by scanning Miranda Kerr Tea for One Teapot sample products made from Bone China clay. Digital data from the scanning process is used to design a teapot model that is precise and accurate. The digital data generated by Next Engine 3D and the priXa 1588 CMM is then converted into stereolithography (STL) file format (triangle-based data). The process of making 3D CAD models consists of: editing the 3D mesh from the scanning results, 3D CAD design forming the size of the fire, the size of the model, and the 3D CAD milling process using PowerSHAPE with the final result in the form of the surface of each part of the Teapot product. Manufacturing optimization to get the optimal machining strategy used PowerMILL and CNC machines. The casting process becomes a follow-up process after machining the mold of the designed product. This research has succeeded in demonstrating the advantages of using CARE System technology in the national ceramic industry in Indonesia so that it can compete at national and international levels. This is based on the magnitude of the RE error value of less than 1.00 mm with a total processing time of 43 hours 18 minutes 10 seconds and a total cost of about $ 4172.35. © 2021 The Author(s).

The duct is filled with electrically conducting nanofluid and subjected to mutually orthogonal static electric and magnetic fields. The one-phase Tiwari–Das model is employed to simulate nanoscale effects. The study is conducted for four different electroconductive nanofluids using water as a base fluid. The left and right plates of the enclosure are kept at different constant temperatures and concentrations. The top and bottom faces are insulated and impermeable to heat and mass trans-fer, respectively. The transport equations describe the velocity, temperature, and nanoparticle concentration fields. These coupled differential Navier–Stokes equations are nonlinear and therefore discretized via a robust finite difference method (FDM). The reduced difference equations are solved by incorporating the successive-over-relaxation (SOR) method. The results are shown graphically for various governing parameters. The skin friction, Nusselt and Sherwood numbers for the impact of selected electromagnetic, nanoscale, and thermophysical parameters are com-puted. The study is relevant to thermal power technologies, bioelectromagnetic therapy, and nu-clear engineering heat transfer control. © 2021 Begell House, Inc. www.begellhouse.com.","Conducting nanofluids; Duct; Electric field; Finite difference method (FDM); Magnetic field; Nonlinear; Thermosolutal con-vection; Viscous flow","Difference equations; Ducts; Finite difference method; Heat convection; Magnetic fields; Nanotechnology; Navier Stokes equations; Nonlinear equations; Thermal Engineering; Double-diffusive convection; Electric and magnetic fields; Finitedifference methods (FDM); Governing parameters; Heat transfer control; Nanoparticle concentrations; Successive over relaxation; Thermo-physical parameters; Nanofluidics","","","","","","","Aybar H.S., Sharifpur M., Azizian M.R., Mehrabi M., Meyer J.P., A Review of Thermal Conductivity Models for Nanofluids, Heat Transf.

Designing the fine-scale geometry of a metamaterial structure to perform a specific behavior defines an inverse problem that is often intractable. To make this inverse problem tractable, most researchers represent metamaterial structures relying on a single-type periodic unit cell that is repeated in regular grids. Such a representation simplifies modeling and simulation tasks but at the cost of conceivably limiting the spectrum of physical properties that can be achieved by using more than one type of unit cells. This paper defines a non-periodic representation via implicit functions that generate two types of unit cells in pairs, which cope with the geometric frustration of interface connection in non-periodic metamaterial design. To solve the inverse problem of non-periodic metamaterial design, we propose a genetic algorithm-based combinatorial optimization scheme to design light-weight and high-strength functional parts by optimizing relevant parameters in the generating functions of non-periodic unit cells. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Finite-element simulation; Light-weight part; Metamaterial; Non-periodic microstructure; Optimization","3D printers; Cells; Combinatorial optimization; Cytology; Genetic algorithms; Geometry; Inverse problems; Metamaterials; Physical properties; Advanced manufacturing; Combinatorial design; Complex geometries; Generating functions; Geometric frustration; Metamaterial structures; Model and simulation; Potential techniques; Structural design","","","","","","","Stava O., Vanek J., Benes B., Carr N., Mech R., Stress relief: improving structural strength of 3d printable objects, ACM Trans.

The shift from conventional manufacturing systems to AM implies several changes throughout the medical product’s life cycle phases, from workforce qualification to the relationship with customers. This study investigates the social impact of adopting AM in the medical devices industry. To this end, two case studies related to medical devices were developed: a prosthesis and an orthosis, by applying a social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) methodology. The methodology measures and compares performance and impact of developing, producing, and using the two devices produced by AM, and by conventional processes. The results show how the different stakeholders along the product life cycle stages are affected by the change in the manufacturing technology. Evidence of positive social impacts were found in the ‘Customers’, ‘Local community’ and ‘Society’ stakeholders. A negative social impact was found for the stakeholder ‘Value chain actors’. Furthermore, this study illustrates the suitability of the S-LCA methodology to pinpoint the benefits and negative impacts of AM in each case under study. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","3D printers; Additives; Economic and social effects; Health care; Prosthetics; Conventional manufacturing; Healthcare industry; Local community; Manufacturing technologies; Medical Devices; Medical products; Product Life Cycle stages; Social impact; Life cycle","","","","","UNIDEMI, (PD/BD/140820/2018); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (UIDB/00667/2020, PTDC/EME-SIS/32232/2017, UIDB/50022/2020); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT","This work was supported by FCT, through IDMEC, under LAETA, project UIDB/50022/2020.

One of the most used plastic material ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) is sometimes coated to increase its wear and corrosion resistance. In this study, investigating the effect of coating and test forces on wear behavior of injection-molded ABS specimens at room temperature were focused. For this purpose, ABS specimens were manufactured with injection molding technology and some samples were multilayer Cu-Ni-Cr coated step by step. Then, surface roughness values of prepared coated and uncoated specimens were measured by surface roughness profilometer. Subsequently, the micro view of the coated sample was obtained from an optical microscope after cutting the sample with the precision cutting machine. Lastly, the wear performance of coated and uncoated samples was tested under various loads such as 5N, 7N, and 10N by using pin-on-disc test equipment. In conclusion, surface roughness and wear level of samples were determined besides the average friction coefficient and friction forces. The results show that multilayer Cu-Ni-Cr coating affects the friction forces and average friction coefficient values significantly. © 2021, TUBITAK.

The flexibility of AM often enables low-volume and custom production, making conventional methods of machine qualification and health monitoring challenging to implement. Machine health has been difficult to separate from the effects of design and process decisions, and therefore inferring machine health through part quality has been similarly complicated. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper proposes a framework for monitoring machine health by monitoring two types of witness parts, in the form of witness builds and witness artifacts, to provide sources of data for potential indicators of machine health. Findings: The proposed conceptual framework with witness builds and witness artifacts permits the implementation into AM techniques to monitor machine health according to part quality. Subsequently, probabilistic models can be used to optimize machine costs and repairs, as opposed to statistical approaches that are less ideal for AM. Bayesian networks, hidden Markov models and Markov decision processes may be well-suited to accomplishing this task. Originality/value: Though variations of witness builds have been created for use in AM to measure build quality and machine capabilities, the literature contains no previously proposed framework that permits the evaluation of machine health and its influence on quality through a combination of witness builds and witness artifacts, both of which can be easily added into AM production. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing;

In comparison with conventional electrodes with uncontrollable geometries and architectures, 3D-printed electrodes possess unique advantage in geometrical shape, mechanical properties, surface area, especially in ion transport and charge transfer. Thus, a desirable 3D electrode with ordered porous structures can be elaborately designed by 3D printing technology for improving electrochemical capacitance and rate capability. In this work, a designed, monolithic and ordered multi-porous 3D Cu conductive skeleton was manufactured through 3D direct ink writing technique and coated with CuO nanosheet arrays by an in situ electro-oxidation treatment. Benefiting from the highly ordered multi-porous nature, the 3D-structured skeleton can effectively enlarge the surface area, enhance the penetration of electrolyte and facilitate fast electron and ion transport. As a result, the 3D-printed Cu deposited with electro-oxidation-generated CuO (3DP Cu@CuO) electrodes demonstrates an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 1.690 F cm−2 (38.79 F cm−3) at a large current density of 30 mA cm−2 (688.59 mA cm−3), excellent lifespan of 88.20% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at 30 mA cm−2 and superior rate capability (94.31% retention, 2-30 mA cm−2). This design concept of 3D printing multi-porous current collector with hierarchical active materials provides a novel way to build high-performance 3D microelectrodes. © 2020, The Chinese Society for Metals (CSM) and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","3D printing; Copper oxide; High areal specific capacitance; Microelectrode; Multi-porous current; Supercapacitor","Capacitance; Charge transfer; Copper oxides; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolytes; Electrooxidation; Geometry; Microelectrodes; Musculoskeletal system; Nanosheets; Oxidation; Phosphorus compounds; Supercapacitor; Additive manufacture; Arbitrary geometry; Capacitance retention; Electrochemical capacitance; Geometrical shapes; Large current density; Porous current collectors; Printed electrodes; 3D printers","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51771236, 51901249, U1904216); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of Hunan Province, (2018JJ1038); Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of Hunan Province","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51771236, 51901249 and U1904216), the Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of Hunan Province (No. 2018JJ1038).","Sun K., Wei T.S., Ahn B.Y., Seo J.Y., Dillon S.J., Lewis J.A., Adv.

However, there is still no standard that can be used to determine properties such as the interfacial strength of adjacent tracks and also to exclude the influence of varying manufacturing conditions. In this paper, a proposal is made to determine the interfacial strength using specimens with only one track within a layer. For this purpose, so-called single-wall specimens of polylactide were characterised under tensile load and the interfacial area between the adjacent layers was determined using three methods. It turned out that the determination of the interfacial area via the fracture surface is the most accurate method for determining the interfacial strength. The measured interfacial strengths were compared with the bulk material strength and it was found that the bulk material strength can be achieved under optimal conditions in the FFF process. It was also observed that with increasing nozzle temperature, the simultaneous printing of specimens influences the interfacial strength. To conclude, this method allows to measure the interfacial strength without superimposing the influence of voids. However, for example, the interfacial strength within a layer cannot be determined. © A.

However, the inferior surface quality of AM components, particularly the partially melted powders adhering to the surface, restricts the functionality of the as-printed parts. In particular, the internal hole is more challenging to finish because of its poor visibility. This study proposed an electrochemical machining (ECM) process that employed a salt solvent to finish an internal surface produced using AM. This ECM process could reduce the topographical fluctuation of the surface by eliminating the adhesive powders and removing the band protrusions caused by the laser melting process. This reduced the surface roughness (Sa) values of a straight hole from 14.151 to 6.287 μm. The proposed ECM process was also effective at finishing the internal surface of a curving hole produced using AM, which is complicated to handle using many other machining methods. In this process, a flexible cathode insulated by several blocks moved across a curving internal hole in a reciprocating manner to perform the electrochemical dissolution. The adhesive powders on the curved surface could be eliminated, and the surface asperities could be removed, with the Sa values reduced from 15.522 to 8.102 μm. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Additive manufacturing; Adhesive powder; Electrochemical machining; Internal surface","3D printers; Additives; Cathodes; Electric discharge machining; Electrochemical cutting; Powders; Surface roughness; Curved surfaces; Electrochemical dissolution; Electrochemical machining; Internal surfaces; Laser melting process; Machining methods; Poor visibility; Surface asperities; Adhesives","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFB1105902); Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, (51921003)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant number: 2018YFB1105902) and National Natural Science Foundation of China for Creative Research Groups (grant number: 51921003).; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant number: 2018YFB1105902 ) and National Natural Science Foundation of China for Creative Research Groups (grant number: 51921003 ).","Herzog D., Seyda V., Wycisk E., Emmelmann C., Additive manufacturing of metals, Acta Mater, 117, pp. 371-392, (2016); Townsend A., Senin N., Blunt L., Leach R.K., Taylor J.S., Surface texture metrology for metal additive manufacturing: a review, Precis Eng, 46, pp. 34-47, (2016); Maiya P.S., Busch D.E., Effect of surface roughness on low-cycle fatigue behavior of type 304 stainless steel, Metall Trans A, 6, (1975); Nie X., Zhang H., Zhu H., Hu Z., Ke L., Zeng X., Analysis of processing parameters and characteristics of selective laser melted high strength Al-Cu-Mg alloys: from single tracks to cubic samples, J Mater Process Technol, 256, pp. 69-77, (2018); Mumtaz K., Hopkinson N., Top surface and side roughness of Inconel 625 parts processed using selective laser melting, Rapid Prototyp J, 15, 2, pp. 96-103, (2009); Strano G., Hao L., Everson R.M., Evans K.E., Surface roughness analysis, modelling and prediction in selective laser melting, J Mater Process Technol, 213, pp. 589-597, (2013); Mohammadian N., Turenne S., Brailovski V., Surface finish control of additively-manufactured Inconel 625 components using combined chemical-abrasive flow polishing, J Mater Process Technol, 252, pp. 728-738, (2018); Van Hooreweder B., Lietaert K., Neirinck B., Lippiatt N., Wevers M., CoCr F75 scaffolds produced by additive manufacturing: influence of chemical etching on powder removal and mechanical performance, J Mech Behav Biomed Mater, 70, pp. 60-67, (2017); Bhaduri D., Penchev P., Batal A., Dimov S.S., Soo S.L., Sten S., Et al., Laser polishing of 3D printed mesoscale components, Appl Surf Sci, 405, pp. 29-46, (2017); Lober L., Flache C., Petters R., Kuhn U., Eckert J., Comparison of different post processing technologies for SLM generated 316l steel parts, Rapid Prototyp J, 19, pp. 173-179, (2013); Zhang B., Lee X., Bai J., Guo J., Pan W., Sun C.N., Et al., Study of selective laser melting (SLM) Inconel 718 part surface improvement by electrochemical polishing, Mater Des, 116, pp. 531-537, (2017); Guo J., Au K.H., Sun C.-N., Goh M.H., Kum C.W., Liu K., Et al., Novel rotating-vibrating magnetic abrasive polishing method for double-layered internal surface finishing, J Mater Process Technol, 264, pp. 422-437, (2019); Nagalingam A.P., Yuvaraj H.K., Yeo S.H., Synergistic effects in hydrodynamic cavitation abrasive finishing for internal surface-finish enhancement of additive-manufactured components, Addit Manuf, 33, (2020); Duval-Chaneac M.S., Han S., Claudin C., Salvatore F., Bajolet J., Rech J., Experimental study on finishing of internal laser melting (SLM) surface with abrasive flow machining (AFM), Precis Eng, 54, pp. 1-6, (2018); Urlea V., Brailovski V., Electropolishing and electropolishing-related allowances for powder bed selectively laser-melted Ti-6Al-4V alloy components, J Mater Process Technol, 242, pp. 1-11, (2017); Tyagi P., Goulet T., Riso C., Stephenson R., Chuenprateep N., Schlitzer J., Et al., Reducing the roughness of internal surface of an additive manufacturing produced 316 steel component by chempolishing and electropolishing, Addit Manuf, 25, pp. 32-38, (2019); Liu C.M., Tian X., Tang H.B., Wang H.M., Microstructural characterization of laser melting deposited Ti–5Al-5Mo–5V–1Cr–1Fe near β titanium alloy, J Alloys Compd, 572, pp. 17-24, (2013); Chen X., Qu N., Fang X., Zhu D., Reduction of undercutting in electrochemical micro-machining of micro-dimple arrays by utilizing oxygen produced at the anode, Surf Coat Technol, 277, pp. 44-51, (2015)","N.

However, it is severely challenging to fabricate stiffener structures within a cylinder's restricted space via traditional processes. Techniques that allow for the deposition of metallic structures through zones in difficult-to-access positions, e.g., the inner walls of a cylinder, are quite limited. Laser inside additive manufacturing (LIAM) technology is applied to produce components in the inner walls of thin tubes, whose processing environments are restricted due to their small internal space. Nevertheless, the powder motion behavior driven by the feeding gas and LIAM's operating temperature in the restricted space is not evident. A simulation of the LIAM process as a feasible alternative for application in restricted spaces was investigated in the present study. The effects of the spatial constraints and the carrier gas velocity on the powder flow's aggregation and temperature distribution were studied. It was found that the powder flow was distributed in a convergent shape, which could be divided into an annular area, convergence area, and divergence area. With the increase in the carrier gas velocity, the powder flow concentration was found to decrease gradually. The powder utilization rate of LIAM was found to be as high as 60.5%. Moreover, a higher temperature was achieved in the powder flow for the cylinder substrate due to the difference in the geometric structure and the higher reflection of the cylinder substrate to laser intensity. © 2020 CIRP","Laser inside additive manufacturing; Numerical simulation; Powder flow; Temperature distribution","3D printers; Additives; Cylinders (shapes); Temperature distribution; Additive manufacturing process; Carrier gas velocity; Environmental constraints; Feasible alternatives; Geometric structure; High speed aircrafts; Operating temperature; Processing environments; Aerospace industry","","","","","National Key Research and Development Program ?; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51735005, 51790175); National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFB1100101, 2018YFB1106302); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (NE2018003); Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, (51921003, TD-GDZB-001); Program for Jiangsu Excellent Scientific and Technological Innovation Team","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 51735005, 51790175 ]; National Key Research and Development Program “Additive Manufacturing and Laser Manufacturing” [grant numbers 2016YFB1100101, 2018YFB1106302 ]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [grant number NE2018003 ]; National Natural Science Foundation of China for Creative Research Groups [grant number 51921003 ]; The 15th Batch of “Six Talents Peaks” Innovative Talents Team Program [grant number TD-GDZB-001 ]; and 2017 Excellent Scientific and Technological Innovation Teams of Universities in Jiangsu.; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 51735005, 51790175]; National Key Research and Development Program ?Additive Manufacturing and Laser Manufacturing?

In the viewpoint of Industry 4.0 and sustainable manufacturing, AM technologies are gaining importance than conventional manufacturing route (subtractive manufacturing). Because of the ease of use and lesser operation skills, MEX had wide popularity in industry for product and prototype development. This study aims to analyze energy consumption of MEX-based AM process and its influencing factors. Design/methodology/approach: A group of factors were identified pertaining to MEX-based AM process. In this viewpoint, this study presents the configuration of a structural model using interpretive structural modeling (ISM) to depict dominant factors in MEX-based AM process. A total of 18 influencing factors are identified and ranked using ISM methodology for MEX process. The Impact Matrix Cross-reference Multiplication Applied to a Classification analysis was done to categorize influencing factors into four groups for MEX-based AM process. Findings: The derivation of structural model would enable AM practitioners to systematically analyze the factors and to derive key factors which enable comprehensive energy modeling and energy assessment studies.

The main focus is to find the optimal fleet size and the type of ships used for the Indonesian Sea Tollway. A mathematical model for anticipating fleet demand under various circumstances has been built. The model primarily focuses on the strategic level, where the task is to minimize the total renting and operating/fuel costs for the vessels during the planning horizon. A deployment model was also generated to test the Fleet Size and Mix Model's accuracy, which comes under tactical planning. Fleet composition is given in tactical planning, and the goal is to find the precise uti-lization of the available ship to fulfil the transportation demand. Both FSM and FDM Models for our given problem are solved by integer programming on Python using Pandas, Numpy, and Pulp libraries. This article can be used as a guide to assist the Indonesian govern-ment in finding the exact fleet composition and routing. © 2021 Logistics Journal.","Fleet deployment Problems; Fleet size and mix problems; Indonesian Sea Tollways; Integer programming; Routing and scheduling problems","","","","","","","","Stopford Martin, Maritime Economics 3 edition, (2009); Hoff Arild, Christiansen Marielle, Andersson Hendrik, Et al., Industrial Aspects and Literature Survey: Fleet Composition and Routing, Computers and Operations Research, (2010); Voorde Eddy Van de, Vanelslander Thierry, Market Power and Vertical and Horizontal Integration in the Maritime Shipping and Port Industry, (2009); Fagerholt Kjetil, Christiansen Marielle, Hvattum Lars Magnus, Et al., A Decision Support Methodology for Strategic Planning in Maritime Transportation, Omega-International Journal of Management Science, (2010); Pradana Muhammad Fakhruriza, Noche Bernd, Prospects and Challenges in Developing Indonesian Sea Tollway,  International Conference on Food Security Innovation, (2019); Christiansen Marielle, Fagerholt Kjetil, Ronen David, Ship Routing and Scheduling: Status and Perspectives, Transportation Science, (2004); Asariotis Regina, Benamara Hassiba, Hoffman Jan, Et al., Review of Maritime Transport 2010, (2010); Giovanni Pantuso, Fagerholt Kjetil, Hvattum Lars Magnus, A Survey on Maritime Fleet Size and Mix Problems, European Journal of Operational Research, (2014); Asariotis Regina, Benamara Hassiba, Hoffman Jan, Et al., Review of Maritime Transport 2011, (2011); Christiansen Marielle, Fagerholt Kjetil, Nygreen Bjorn, Ronen David, Maritme Transportation, Handbooks in Operations Research and Management Science, 14, (2007); Powell BJ, Perkins AN, Fleet Deployment Optimization for Liner Shipping: An Integer Programming Model, Maritime Policy and Management, (1997); Barrass Bryan, Ship Design and Performance for Masters and Mates, (2004); Mulder Judith, Dekker Rommert, Optimization in Container Liner Shipping, (2016); Brouer Berit D, Alvarez J Fernando, Plum Christian EM, Et al., A Base Integer Programming and Benchmark Suite for Liner-Shipping Network Design, Transportation Science, (2014)","","","Wissenschaftliche Gesellschaft fur Technische Logistik","","","","","","18607977","","","","English","Logist.

Here, we present a novel class of micro-structures exhibiting an extension-bending coupling (EBC) effect, that can be harnessed as an elementary building block for shape-shifting panels. They are built with a single material as a network of undulated ribbons. The deformations mechanisms of both single and connected undulated ribbons are analysed using the finite element method to explain the main features of the EBC mechanism. For a particular micro-structure of the proposed class, the elastic response is investigated both under small strain assumption combining two-scale homogenization with Kirchhoff–Love plate theory, and at finite strains relying on numerical analysis. The range of achievable EBC ratio is then assessed with respect to the geometric parameters of the unit cell. Patterned specimens are manufactured using a commercial FFF Ultimaker 3D printer and are mechanically tested at finite strain up to 20%. The displacement measured by point tracking match the predictions from the finite element simulations and indicate that the structure maintain its properties at finite strain. Moreover, a tensile test load with point-like boundary is proposed to highlight exceptional out of plane displacement. The proposed ribbon based architectures can be combined with active materials for the actuation of shape shifting structures, like soft robots, control systems and power devices. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","3D printing; Metamaterial; Panels; Shape shifting; Undulated ribbons","Finite element method; Flight control systems; Microstructure; Strain; Tensile testing; Active material; Elastic response; Elementary building blocks; External stimulus; Finite element simulations; Out-of-plane displacement; Point tracking; Three-dimensional object; 3D printers","","","","","Agence Nationale pour la Recherche, France, (ANR-15-CE29-0024-01)","F.

Landing on a single leg following a spike may increase the probability of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. The purpose of this study was to compare and analyze the kinematics and kinetics differences during the landing phase of volleyball players using a single leg (SL) and double-leg landing (DL) following a spike shot. The data for vertical ground reaction forces (VGRF) and sagittal plane were collected. SPM analysis revealed that SL depicted a smaller knee flexion angle (about 13.8◦) and hip flexion angle (about 10.8◦) during the whole landing phase, a greater knee and hip power during the 16.83–20.45% (p = 0.006) and 13.01–16.26% (p = 0.008) landing phase, a greater ankle plantarflexion angle and moment during the 0–41.07% (p < 0.001) and 2.76–79.45% (p < 0.001) landing phase, a greater VGRF during the 5.87–8.25% (p = 0.029), 19.75–24.14% (p = 0.003) landing phase when compared to DL. Most of these differences fall within the time range of ACL injury (30–50 milliseconds after landing). To reduce non-contact ACL injuries, a landing strategy of consciously increasing the hip and knee flexion, and plantarflexion of the ankle should be considered by volleyball players. © 2020 by the authors.

The main reason for the success of PDMS in the field of microfluidic research is its suitability for rapid prototyping and simple bonding methods. PDMS allows for precise microstructuring by replica molding and bonding to different substrates through various established strategies. However, large-scale production and commercialization efforts are hindered by the low scalability of PDMS-based chip fabrication and high material costs. Furthermore, fundamental limitations of PDMS, such as small molecule absorption and high water evaporation, have resulted in a shift toward PDMS-free systems. Thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) are a promising alternative, combining properties from both thermoplastic materials and elastomers. Here, we present a rapid and scalable fabrication method for microfluidic systems based on a polycarbonate (PC) and TPE hybrid material. Microstructured PC/TPE-hybrid modules are generated by hot embossing precise features into the TPE while simultaneously fusing the flexible TPE to a rigid thermoplastic layer through thermal fusion bonding. Compared to TPE alone, the resulting, more rigid composite material improves device handling while maintaining the key advantages of TPE. In a fast and simple process, the PC/TPE-hybrid can be bonded to several types of thermoplastics as well as glass substrates. The resulting bond strength withstands at least 7.5 bar of applied pressure, even after seven days of exposure to a high-temperature and humid environment, which makes the PC/TPE-hybrid suitable for most microfluidic applications. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the PC/TPE-hybrid features low absorption of small molecules while being biocompatible, making it a suitable material for microfluidic biotechnological applications. © 2021 by the authors.

AM offers better control over structural features of porous scaffolds at the time of fabrication. In this study, calcium sulphate-based porous bone scaffolds have been fabricated using 3D printing technology. Initially, the minimum pore size (600 µm) that can be de-powdered is identified through a pilot study. Then, four porous scaffolds (VJ_P6_S6, VJ_P6_S7, VJ_P7_S6 and VJ_P7_S7) have been designed using two different pore and strut sizes (600 and 700 µm) and fabricated along x-, y- and z-axes on ZPrinter® 450. The fabricated scaffolds are then compared for dimensional accuracy, compressive strength and measured porosity. Results show that scaffolds fabricated along the x-axis are found best in terms of dimensional accuracy, compressive strength and fabricated porosity. The maximum compressive strength among solid samples is found 2.92 MPa; whereas, for porous samples, it is found 1.86 MPa in VJ_P7_S6 sample fabricated along the x-axis. The porosity in fabricated samples is measured using micro-computed tomography scan images and found a minimum reduction of 3.9% from the designed porosity in sample VJ_P7_S7 fabricated along the x-axis. A preliminary biological investigation reveals that the used material has no significant toxic effect on cells and provides a favourable media for cell adhesion and growth. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","3D printing; additive manufacturing; calcium sulphate; compressive strength; computed tomography; porous bone scaffold","3D printers; Additives; Bone; Calcium compounds; Cell adhesion; Computerized tomography; Fabrication; Pore size; Scaffolds (biology); Sulfur compounds; Calcium sulphate; Dimensional accuracy; Maximum compressive strengths; Microcomputed tomography; Porous bone scaffold; Porous scaffold; Structural feature; Synthetic bone scaffolds; Compressive strength","","","","","M.P.

Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation is the most critical problem in cloud computing. SLA violation creates many problems for cloud service providers and cloud customers. Due to this, cloud customer gets low-quality cloud service. Thus, designing an effective cloud service recommendation algorithm is a critical research problem in cloud computing. The primary objective of this research is to determine the optimal cloud service from functionally equivalent cloud services that better fit the user's requirements (latency, throughput, response time, and cost). The efficiency of cloud services varies according to the time and location of the virtual machine. First, this proposed method determines the correlation between active user requirements and cloud services. Second, strongly correlated services are separated into two clusters based on the virtual machine's location and the cloud service's data transmission rate. For this purpose, two lightweight clustering algorithms have been proposed. A modified multilayer perceptron algorithm has been developed to recommend the optimal cloud service to the active user from the two clusters. The open-source WS-Dream dataset is used to train and validate the proposed MLP. The training efficiency, prediction accuracy, and performance of the proposed MLP-based cloud service recommendation system are experimentally compared to the existing cloud service recommendation systems analysed in the literature study [20, 2, 22, 23]. Compared to existing cloud service recommendation approaches, the MAE and RMSE values of the proposed cloud service recommendation system are less than one. In terms of accuracy, the suggested method obtains a precession of 94 %, a recall of 97 %, and an F1-Measure of 96 %, all of these are significantly better than the existing cloud service recommendation methods. Finally, experimental results prove that the overall performance of the proposed method's throughput (increase 10 MBPS), latency (reduce 10 ms), the response time (reduce 17 ms) and service recommendation time (reduce 5ms) is more robust than existing methods. © 2021.

This technology allows to print complex shape objects and is being rapidly adopted throughout the aircraft industry, medical implants, jewelry, footwear industry, automotive industry, and fashion products. The build orientation of 3D objects has a strong influence on many quality characteristics. In this paper, a many-objective approach is applied to the Fin model, using the NSGA-II algorithm to optimize four conflicting objective functions regarding the need for support structures, the build time, the surface roughness, and the overall quality of the surface. First, a bi-objective optimization is performed for each couple of two objectives and some representative solutions are identified. However, when applying many-objective optimization to the four objective functions simultaneously, some more orientation angles are found as good optimal solutions. Visualization tools are used to inspect the relationships and the trade-offs between the objectives. Then, the decision-maker can choose which orientation angles are more favorable according to his/her preferences. The optimal solutions found confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Build orientation; Multi-objective optimization","Additives; Computer aided design; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Optimal systems; Shoe manufacture; Surface roughness; Aircraft industries; Bi-objective optimization; Computer aided design models; Conflicting objectives; Many-objective optimizations; Objective approaches; Quality characteristic; Three-dimensional object; 3D printers","","","","","Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia, (UIDB/00319/2020); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER","This work has been developed under the FIBR3D project - Hybrid processes based on additive manufacturing of composites with long or short fibers reinforced thermoplastic matrix (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-016414), supported by the Lisbon Regional Operational Programme 2020, under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).

AM technology is severely limited by the lack of effective methods for in situ characterization of multi-material properties and composition during printing. The ability to detect the composition of multi-material printed inks in real time is an emerging need for a wide range of manufacturing applications. In this study, dielectric properties of embedded metal microparticles in a dielectric matrix are measured and characterized as a function of particle size, shape, volume percentage and frequency. Unexpectedly, there was no observation of any percolation threshold. The impedance was found to decrease with the percentage of metal filler as expected. While particle shape seemed to have significant effect on the impedance, there was little to no correlation between particle size and impedance. The resulting data can be used to generate a calibration curve correlating metal loading with impedance or capacitance. We discuss how this data can be used for in situ sensing of local ink composition, which does not currently exist, to facilitate greater control over the resulting properties and functionality of printed materials.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.","3D printing; additive manufacturing; in situ monitoring; material sensor; metal-polymer composites","Additives; Dielectric properties; Metal extrusion; Metals; Particle size; Solvents; Calibration curves; Dielectric matrixes; In-situ characterization; Manufacturing applications; Metal-polymer composites; Percolation thresholds; Rapid optimization; Volume percentage; 3D printers","","","","","Electronics Fabrication Group; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-AC52–07NA27344, LLNL-JRNL-808128); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, LLNL; Laboratory Directed Research and Development, LDRD, (19-FS-036); Laboratory Directed Research and Development, LDRD","Funding text 1: The authors gratefully acknowledge the support from the LLNL Precision Machine Shop, Area Shops, and Electronics Fabrication Group.; Funding text 2: Manuscript received July 1, 2020; accepted July 24, 2020.

Aerodynamics and lightweight construction play a major role, so each element applied in the car is optimized and customized to fit in the vehicle. For this purpose, 3D-printing technology is often used by the team. A seat model made on the basis of the driver's anthropometric model was presented in the paper. Subsequently, after the appropriate adaptation of the obtained surfaces to interconnect them with each other, the FDM technology was applied using PET-G material. To increase the strength of the connections of the printed elements and to strengthen the design and stability of the chair, the element was laminated using carbon fibre and epoxy resin.

Products are first created in parallel batches at a single AM station before being subjected to several post-processing operations. While there exists an emerging literature on AM station scheduling and order book smoothing, this literature has largely neglected downstream post-processing operations, which also affect overall performance. Workload Control provides a unique production control solution for these post-processing operations, but the specific AM shop structure has been neglected in the literature. Using simulation, this study shows that load balancing via the use of workload norms, as is typical for Workload Control, becomes ineffective since the norm must allow for the operation throughput time at the AM station and for its variability. A sequencing rule for the jobs waiting to be released that inherently creates a mix of jobs that balances the workload is therefore identified as the best-performing rule. These findings reinforce the principle that load limiting should be used at upstream stations whereas sequencing should be applied at downstream stations. Finally, although the focus is on AM shops, the findings have implications for other shops with similar structures, e.g. in the steel and semi-conductor industries. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","3D printing;

Their traditional role is to reestablish and maintain intervertebral disc height, contain bone graft and provide mechanical support for the spine while osseointegration takes place. Utilizing the principles of mechanobiology, a unique biokinetic interbody fusion device has been developed that employs an advanced structural design to facilitate and actively participate in the fusion consolidation process. Areas covered: This article profiles and characterizes 4WEB Medical’s Truss Implant Technology™ which includes a range of 3D-printed titanium spinal interbody implants and non-spinal implants whose design is based on truss structures enabled by advances in additive manufacturing. Four main areas of the implant design and functionality are detailed: bio-architecture, mechanobiologic underpinnings, bioactive surface features, and subsidence resistance. Pre-clinical and clinical examples are provided to describe and specify the bioactive roles and contributions of each design feature. Expert opinion: The distinct and unique combination of features incorporated within the truss cage design results in a biokinetic implant that actively participates in the bone healing cascade and fusion process. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Disc degeneration; interbody spinal fusion; mechanobiology; osseointegration; surface topography; titanium; topology; truss","Biophysics; Humans; Intervertebral Disc; Lumbar Vertebrae; Prostheses and Implants; Spinal Fusion; Technology; Fusion reactors; Implants (surgical); Structural design; Tissue regeneration; Trusses; titanium; Bioactive surfaces; Consolidation process; Degenerative disc disease; Implant technology; Interbody fusion devices; Intervertebral discs; Mechanical support; Performance characteristics; Article; biomechanics; bone graft; cell culture; cell differentiation; compression; equipment design; fracture healing; human; intervertebral disk degeneration; mechanical stress; medical device regulation; osseointegration; spine fusion; surface property; tension; three dimensional printing; topography; biophysics; intervertebral disk; lumbar vertebra; prostheses and orthoses; surgery; technology; 3D printers","","titanium, 7440-32-6","Truss Implant Technology","","","","Reid P.C., Morr S., Kaiser M.G., State of the union: a review of lumbar fusion indications and techniques for degenerative spine disease, J Neurosurg Spine, 31, 1, pp. 1-14, (2019); Taher F., Essig D., Lebl D.R., Lumbar degenerative disc disease: current and future concepts of diagnosis and management, Adv Orthop, (2012); Middleton K., Fish D.E., Lumbar spondylosis: clinical presentation and treatment approaches, Curr Rev Musculoskelet Med, 2, 2, pp. 94-104, (2009); Noshchenko A., Hoffecker L., Lindley E.M., Et al., Long-term treatment effects of lumbar arthrodeses in degenerative disk disease: A systematic review with meta-analysis, J Spinal Disord Tech, 28, 9, pp. E493-E521, (2015); Blumenthal S.L., Ohnmeiss D.D., Nass.

While the thermal-microstructure relationship in AM has been reported, the details on how complex thermal histories influence the microstructural evolution have not been so addressed, and the formation of layer bands in multi-layer multi-pass builds is still unclear. To undertake such investigation, a thermal model is firstly calibrated using two part-scale blocks fabricated on differently sized substrates, and then used to study the relationship between key microstructural characteristics and the thermal cycling involved. Results show that the different evolutions of the temperature ranges just underneath the β-transus temperature (T β) controlled by the printing path are responsible for the different band distributions at the centre and corner of the blocks. Also, the α sizes in the normal region are closely linked to the integral area obtained from the thermal curve as temperature fluctuates between T β and α dissolution temperature, which helps linking AM variables to metallurgy. This further demonstrates that the α coarsening during thermal cycles is primarily driven by multi dissolution and precipation transformations instead of Ostwald ripening.

The photogalvanic cells as described in the present manuscript provide a route for simultaneous solar power generation and its storage. These cells have been extensively studied at artificial and low intensity sunlight. The Rhodamine B dye sensitiser with Fructose reductant is reported to have shown high electrical output at low intensity. But, these cells have to show very high electrical output that too at natural sun intensity for becoming practically significant and applicable in daily life. Therefore, the present study of photogalvanics of Rhodamine B dye photosensitiser with Fructose as reductant and Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS) as surfactant in alkaline medium has been done to see their workable feasibility in natural sunlight with investigation for optimal fabrication parameters leading to further enhancement in electrical performance of these cells. The greatly enhanced optimum cell performance has been observed at optimal cell fabrication parameters. The cell has been found workable in natural sunlight. The optimum cell performance in terms of maximum power, short-circuit current, open-circuit potential, efficiency and storage capacity (as half change time) is of the order of 620.1 µW, 2400 µA, 1017 mV, 7.75%, and 142 min, respectively. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","dye sensitisation; Natural sunlight; photogalvanic cell; Rhodamine B; solar energy conversion and storage","Cells; Cytology; Fructose; Photoelectrochemical cells; Sodium compounds; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sulfur compounds; Surface active agents; Dye sensitisation; Electrical performance; Fabrication parameters; Natural sunlight; Open circuit potential; Photogalvanic cells; Sodium lauryl sulphate; Wind and solar power; Rhodamine B","","","","","","","Albery W.J., Archer M.D., Optimum Efficiency of Photogalvanic Cells for Solar Energy Conversion, Nature, 270, pp. 399-402, (1977); Albery W.J., Bowen W.R., Fisher S., Turner A.D., Photogalvanic Cells: Part IX.

The essence has been understood by many sectors including, education, manufacturing industries, automotive, medical, aerospace, consumer electronics, bio-medical and even fashion enthusiasts. It is used to prepare this PLA for the used plastics and landfills. By this way, it can reduce the plastics waste from the earth. Compare with ABS plastics, PLA plastics are cheaper. This disruptive technology going to the change the way of manufacturing goods and sets a new narrow path to the future industries. During usage of filament material, it’s got failure due to not enough quality printing because of not proper process parameters. Also, the printed part does not have good surface quality.

The output of the individual photovoltaic module depends on local temperature and irradiance. Since the variation of these parameters depends on the environmental factors, it is difficult to obtain maximum power in all instances. The maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique is used for tracking the maximum power available at a particular instant. This paper presents the maximum power extraction from a photovoltaic system using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. AI based methods provide a fast dynamic response with high accuracy and mitigate the effects of partial shading. A comparative study is performed for various AI based MPPT techniques such as Fuzzy, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). PV module output is interfaced with the resistive load through the Z-Source inverter (ZSI). The ZSI boost the input voltage and provides an AC output voltage. The AI based MPPT techniques have been investigated with conventional Z-source Inverter (ZSI) and Switched Inductor Z-Source inverter (SL-ZSI). A simple boost control technique is employed to control, both conventional and SL Z-source inverter. The performance of the system is verified using MATLAB Simulink. © 2020 Journal of Applied Science and Engineering (Taiwan).

Their optimization has recently attracted some attention, based on the homogenization method, mostly for compliance minimization. The goal of our two-part work is to extend lattice optimization to stress minimization problems two-dimensionally. The present first part is devoted to the choice of a parametrized periodicity cell that will be used for structural optimization in the second part of our work. In order to avoid stress concentration, we propose a square cell microstructure with a super-ellipsoidal hole instead of the standard rectangular hole often used for compliance minimization. This type of cell is parametrized two-dimensionally by one orientation angle, two semi-Axis and a corner smoothing parameter. We first analyse their influence on the stress amplification factor by performing some numerical experiments. Second, we compute the optimal corner smoothing parameter for each possible microstructure and macroscopic stress. Then, we average (with specific weights) the optimal smoothing exponent with respect to the macroscopic stress. Finally, to validate the results, we compare our optimal super-ellipsoidal hole with the Vigdergauz microstructure which is known to be optimal for stress minimization in some special cases.

However, quality assurance for the components produced is still a challenge. Machine learning, especially using artificial neuronal networks, is a potential method for ensuring a high-quality standard. Based on process parameters and monitoring data, part quality can be predicted. A further advantage is the ability to constantly learn and adopt to slight process changes. First tests using artificial neural networks focus on the prediction of track geometry. The results show that even a small data set is enough to provide high accuracy in the predictions. In this work, an artificial neural network for the predictive analysis of relative density in laser powder cladding has been developed. A central composite experimental design is used to generate 19 data sets. Input variables are laser power, feed rate and powder mass flow. Cubes are built up where density is considered as a target value. Several neural networks are trained and evaluated with these data sets. Different topologies and initial weights are considered. The best network reaches a confidence level of around 90 % for the prediction of relative density based on the process parameters. Finally, the optimization of the generalization performance is investigated. To this purpose, methods of variation in error limit as well as cross-validation are applied. In this way, density is predictable by an artificial neural network with an accuracy of about 95 %.  © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston, Germany 2021.","additive manufacturing, artificial neural network; artificial intelligence; directed energy deposition; quality assurance","3D printers; Cladding (coating); Forecasting; Neurons; Predictive analytics; Quality assurance; Artificial neuronal network; Central composite; Confidence levels; Generalization performance; High-quality standards; Potential methods; Process parameters; Relative density; Neural networks","","","","","Industrial Cooperative Research Association; German Federal Ministry for Economic Airs and Energy; German Welding Association; DVS, (IGF 20.612 N.); Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie, BMWi; Allianz Industrie Forschung, AiF","This research was funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Airs and Energy (BMWi) through the Industrial Cooperative Research Association (AiF) and the German Welding Association (DVS) in a project entitled “Certify as you build – Quality assurance for directed energy deposition” under grant number IGF 20.612 N.

This study helped establish the parameters for bioprinting and cross-linking a gelatin-alginate-based bioink into 3D spheroidal droplets. A flattened disk-like structure developed in prior studies from our laboratory was used as a control. The microstructural and mechanical stability of the 3D spheroidal droplets was assessed and was found to be ideal for a cardiac scaffold. Adult human cardiac fibroblasts and AC16 cardiomyocytes were mixed in the bioink and bioprinted. Live-dead assay and flow cytometry analysis revealed robust biocompatibility of the 3D spheroidal droplets that supported the growth and proliferation of the cardiac cells in the long-term cultures. Moreover, the heterocellular gap junctional coupling between the cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts further validated the 3D cardiac spheroidal droplet model.

The Laser Metal Deposition (LMD) is found to be promising for fabrication of FGM. The literatures show the unexpected processing defects such as crack, pores, un-melted powder appear inevitably when using uniform LMD parameters. However, as the FGM usually contains 3–5 kinds of gradient components, it is unsustainable to determine the optimal process parameters for each component through a large number of pre-tests. It is time consuming and costs a lot. Thus, how to obtain reasonable or optimal process parameters for FGM with less pre-tests is a new challenge. In this study, a novel process parameter screening strategy, with the characterized of comprehensively consideration of powder separation, defects and power consumption, was proposed to reduce the pre-tests times and costs during laser additive manufacturing a new FGM material. The results show that the minimum number of process parameters trials required for fabricating Ni–Fe FGM (3 components) reduces from 240 to 118, approximate 50.8% while powder consumption saves 72.8%, as the strategy is adopted. Furthermore, the Ni–Fe FGM fabricated by LMD at the optimized parameters determined by the strategy are defect-free with the tensile strength of 463 MPa, which demonstrates the proposed novel strategy is both effective and environment friendly. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Defect; Functionally graded materials (FGM); Laser metal deposition; Powder consumption; Powder separation; Screening strategy","Defects; Deposition; Electric power utilization; Fabrication; Functionally graded materials; Powder metals; Tensile strength; Advanced engineerings; Environment friendly; Extreme environment; Functionally graded material (FGM); Laser additive manufacturing; Laser metal deposition; Optimized parameter; Powder consumption; Laser materials processing","","","","","Suzhou Technological Innovation of Key Industries Project, (SGC201743); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51805344, 51905360); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2020M671576); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (18KJA460007)","This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51805344 & No. 51905360 ), and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2020M671576 ), and Natural Science Fund for Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province (No. 18KJA460007 ), and Suzhou Technological Innovation of Key Industries Project (No. SGC201743 )","Bobbio L.D., Bocklund B., Otis R., Borgonia J.P., Dillon R.P., Shapiro A.A., McEnerney B., Liu Z.-K., Beese A.M., Characterization of a functionally graded material of Ti-6Al-4V to 304L stainless steel with an intermediate V section, J.

In such cases, contrary to the one-bit quantization case, the well known arcsine law cannot be employed to estimate the covaraince matrix of unquantized array data. Instead, we develop a novel optimization-based framework for retrieving the covaraince matrix of unquantized array data from low-resolution few-bit measurements. The MUSIC algorithm is then applied to an augmented version of the recovered covariance matrix to find the source DoAs. The simulation results show that increasing the sampling resolution to 2 or 4 bits per samples could significantly increase the DoA estimation performance compared to the one-bit sampling regime while the power consumption and implementation costs is still much lower in comparison to the high-resolution sampling implementations.  © 1994-2012 IEEE.","Direction of arrival (DoA) estimation; few-bit quantization; low-resolution quantization; sparse linear arrays","Covariance matrix; Direction of arrivalestimation(DOA); High resolution sampling; Implementation cost; Low resolution; MUSIC algorithms; One-bit quantization; Sampling resolution; Sparse linear arrays; Direction of arrival","","","","","Illinois Discovery Partners Institute; Department of Primary Industries, DPI; European Research Council, ERC; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (742648); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1704401, 1809225); National Science Foundation, NSF; Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg, FNR, (11228830); Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg, FNR","Manuscript received April 13, 2021; revised June 7, 2021; accepted June 16, 2021.

The thruster components are fabricated using additive manufacturing (AM), which enabled fine design features on injectors to achieve fast response times. The main focus of this work is to demonstrate precise and repeatable pulse performance and combustion stability and to compare thruster performance with theoretical predictions from NASA CEA across the chosen test matrix. As part of the pulse performance analysis, impulse produced by each pulse of a given 50 Hz pulse train is characterized, thereby illustrating that true pulse repeatability on such thrusters only starts with the third pulse. This is caused by the priming of the injector manifold at the start of a pulse train. Specific impulse as functions of pulse ON and OFF times are also characterized for a 50 Hz duty cycle and dry injector manifold operation. This method of per-pulse performance characterization aids guidance, navigation, and control teams in thrust/impulse control for attitude control. Overall, the specific impulse, characteristic velocity efficiency, and response times demonstrated by this additively manufactured thruster are similar to those fabricated by traditional methods and support wider use of AM in the aerospace industry. © 2021 by Agile Space Industries, Inc.","","Additives; Aluminum nitride; Attitude control; NASA; Nitric oxide; Design features; Fast response time; Fine designs; Fuel blends; Mixed oxides of nitrogens; Monomethylhydrazine; Performance stability; Performances analysis; Pulse train; Specific impulse; Aerospace industry","","","","","","","Wang S.Q., Thynell S.T., An Experimental Study on the Hypergolic Interaction Between Monomethylhydrazine and Nitric Acid, Combustion and Flame, 159, 1, pp. 438-447, (2012); Edwards T., Liquid Fuels and Propellants for Aerospace Propulsion: 1903–2003, Journal of Propulsion and Power, 19, 6, (2003); Catoire L., Chaumeix N., Paillard C., Chemical Kinetic Model for Monomethylhydrazine/Nitrogen Tetroxide Gas Phase Combustion and Hypergolic Ignition, Journal of Propulsion and Power, 20, 1, pp. 87-92, (2004); Farmer M.J., Mays L.O., Hampton C.S., Smith J.E., Reaction Rates for Hypergolic Propellants Using Chemical Delay Times, Journal of Propulsion and Power, 20, 2, pp. 372-376, (2004); Daimon Y., Terashima H., Koshi M., Chemical Kinetics of Hypergolic Ignition in Gas Mixtures, Journal of Propulsion and Power, 30, 3, (2014); Black A.T., Drolet M.P., Pourpoint T.L., Early Liquid and Gas Phase Hypergolic Reactions Between Monomethylhydrazine and Nitrogen Tetroxide or Red Fuming Nitric Acid, Combustion Science and Technology, 191, 11, pp. 1990-2005, (2019); Schindler R.C., Schoenman L., Development of a Five-Pound Thrust Bipropellant Engine, Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets, 13, 7, pp. 435-442, (1976); Rosenberg S.D., Schoenman L., New Generation of High-Performance Engines for Space Propulsion, Journal of Propulsion and Power, 10, 1, pp. 40-46, (1994); Smith G.W., Sforzini R.H., Pulse Performance Analysis for Small Hypergolic-Propellant Rocket Engines, Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets, 9, 9, pp. 627-628, (1972); Lecourt R., D'Herbigny F.-X., MMH/NTO Injection and Ignition in Vacuum Downstream from an Aestus Engine Single Injection Element, Aerospace Science and Technology, 8, 3, pp. 207-217, (2004); Fujii G., Daimon Y., Inoue C., Shiraiwa D., Tanaka N., Furukawa K., Visualization of Pulse Firing Mode in Hypergolic Bipropellant Thruster, Journal of Propulsion and Power, 36, 5, pp. 677-684, (2020); Gradl P.R., Protz C.S., Technology Advancements for Channel Wall Nozzle Manufacturing in Liquid Rocket Engines, Acta Astronau-Tica, 174, (2020); Sacco E., Moon S.K., Additive Manufacturing for Space: Status and Promises, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 105, 10, pp. 4123-4146, (2019); Frazier W.E., Metal Additive Manufacturing: A Review, Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance, 23, 6, pp. 1917-1928, (2014); Seifi M., Gorelik M., Waller J., Hrabe N., Shamsaei N., Daniewicz S., Lewandowski J.J., Progress Towards Metal Additive Manufacturing Standardization to Support Qualification and Certification, Journal of the Minerals, Metals & Materials Society, 69, 3, (2017); Soller S., Behr R., Beyer S., Laithier F., Lehmann M., Preuss A., Salapete R., Design and Testing of Liquid Propellant Injectors for Additive Manufacturing, pp. 1-10, (2017); Troyan J.E., Properties, Production, and Uses of Hydrazine, Industrial & Engineering Chemistry, 45, 12, pp. 2608-2612, (1953); Harshman R.C., The Physical and Chemical Properties of the Alkyl Hydrazines, Journal of Jet Propulsion, 27, 4, pp. 398-400, (1957); Special Project: Fire, Explosion, Compatibility, and Safety Hazards of Nitrogen Tetroxide,” AIAA SP-086-2001, (2001); Wojcik C.C., Processing, Properties and Applications of High-Tem-perature Niobium Alloys, MRS Online Proceedings Library Archive, 322, (1993); Stechman R.C., Advanced Thrust Chamber Materials for Earth Storable Bipropellant Rocket Engines, Acta Astronautica, 29, 2, pp. 109-115, (1993); Stechman R.C., Oberstone J., Stechman J.C., Design Criteria for Film Cooling for Small Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines, Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets, 6, 2, pp. 97-102, (1969); Gordon S., McBride B.J., Computer Program for Calculation of Complex Chemical Equilibrium Compositions and Applications I, NASA Reference Publ, (1994)","","","AIAA International","","","","","","07484658","","JPPOE","","English","J Propul Power","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118374856"

A Tangent Rooting (TanhR) companding technique is presented in this paper to reduce the PAPR in UWA communication systems. This technique achieves a noticeable reduction of the PAPR in UWA systems, while maintaining a good Bit Error Rate (BER) performance. Channel equalisation with Linear Minimum Mean Square Error (LMMSE) and Zero-Forcing (ZF) equalisers is considered in this paper. Simulation results ensure superiority of the proposed technique compared to the Selected Mapping (SLM) and the Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS) techniques from both the PAPR and BER perspectives. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","equalisation; OFDM; PAPR; Underwater acoustic communication (UWA)","","","","","","Deanship of Scientific Research at Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University","This research was funded by the Deanship of Scientific Research at Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University through the Fast-track Research Funding Program.","Abdel-Galil M.S., Soliman N.F., Abdalla M.I., Abd El-samie F.E., Efficient underwater acoustic communication with peak-to-average power ratio reduction and channel equalization, International Journal of Speech Technology, 22, 3, pp. 649-696, (2019); Akyildiz I., Pompili D., Melodia T., Underwater acoustic sensor networks: Research challenges, Ad Hoc Networks (Elsevier), 3, 3, pp. 257-279, (2005); A New Method to Enhance SC-FDMA Communication with Channel Estimation Errors, Wireless Personal Communications (2019), 104, pp. 527-544, (2019); Companding techniques for SC-FDMA and sensor network applications, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS LETTERS 2020, 8, 3, pp. 241-255, (2020); Fawzy A., Abdelnaby M., Khamis S., Napoleon S., Abd El-samie F., Application of a class of companding techniques on SC-FDMA System, International Journal of Electronics, (2019); Fawzy A., Abdelnaby M.M., Khamis S., Napoleon S., Abel-samie F.E., Apply new companding techniques on DWT based SC-FDMA system, Wireless Personal Communications, (2019); Joshi H.D., Performance augmentation of OFDM system, (2012); Klein A., Data detection algorithms specially designed for the downlink of CDMA mobile radio systems, In Proceedings of IEEE VTC, pp. 203-207, (1997); Kumar P., Kumar P., A comparative study of spread OFDM with transmit diversity for underwater acoustic communications, Wireless Personal Communications, 83, 1, pp. 69-86, (2015); Lim D.-W., Heo S.-J., No J.-S., An overview of peak-to-average power ratio reduction schemes for OFDM signals, Journal of Communications and Networks, 11, 3, pp. 229-239, (2009); Qarabaqi P., Stojanovic M., Statistical characterization and computationally efficient modeling of a class of underwater acoustic communication channels, IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering, 38, 4, pp. 701-717, (2013); Singer A.C., Suleyman S., Signal processing for underwater acoustic communications, IEEE Communications Magazine, pp. 90-99, (2009); Soliman N., Shaalan A., El-Rabaie S., Abd El-Samie F., Peak power reduction of OFDM signals using trigonometric transforms, Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems (ICCES), pp. 333-337, (2009); Stojanovic M., Recent advances in high-speed underwater acoustic communications, IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering, 21, 2, pp. 125-136, (1996); Stojanovic M., Preisig J., Underwater acoustic communication channels: Propagation models and statistical characterization, IEEE Communications Magazine, 47, 1, pp. 84-89, (2009); Wu J., Qiao G., 10, (2016)","M.S.

The welding can be generally categorized into two modes: conduction mode and keyhole mode. In this study, 304L stainless steel parts fabricated by the LFP process using the two laser welding modes are compared. The porosity, microstructure, and tensile properties of the fabricated parts in these two modes are measured and compared in the laser scanning direction (X) and part building direction (Z). The parts fabricated in the conduction mode have a higher density than those fabricated in the keyhole mode. On the tensile properties, both yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) have insignificant differences statistically based on the ANOVA analysis between the tensile specimens fabricated with the two welding modes by the LFP process. However, the conduction-mode parts have higher elongation than the keyhole-mode parts in both the X and Z directions, and the difference is especially significant in the Z direction. By using the electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD), it was found that the much higher ductility for the conduction-mode parts in the Z-axis direction is mainly due to the distinct grain boundary interface density in the Z-axis direction between the two welding modes. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","304L stainless steel; Laser foil printing; Laser welding modes; Mechanical properties; Metal additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Austenitic stainless steel; Grain boundaries; Microstructure; Substrates; Tensile strength; Welding; 304L stainless steel; Electron back-scattered diffraction; Fabricated parts; Fabrication process; Grain boundary interface; Properties and microstructures; Tensile specimens; Ultimate tensile strength; Fabrication","","","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-FE0012272); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Missouri University of Science and Technology, MST","This research work was supported by the Department of Energy (grant number DE-FE0012272) and by the Intelligent Systems Center at the Missouri University of Science and Technology.

This manuscript presents the computational implementation of a 2D-plus-thickness nonlinear thermal simulation of LMD, which considers: (i) temperature-dependent material properties, (ii) heat losses due to convection and radiation, (iii) geometrical update during material deposition, (iv) phase change and (v) the interaction between the laser and the substrate. The implementation computes the history of the temperature field at a cross-cut normal to the laser trajectory and the history of the bead accumulation. The material deposition model is based on the spatial distribution of the delivered powder. This manuscript presents the mathematical and numerical foundations to execute an efficient local re-meshing of the growing bead. The numerical estimation of the bead geometry is compared with experimental results found in the existing literature. The present model shows reasonable accuracy to predict the bead width ((Formula presented.) error) and bead height ((Formula presented.) error). This implementation is an in-house one, which allows for the inclusion of additional physical effects. Additional work is needed to account for the particle (thermo) dynamics over the substrate, responsible for a significant material and energy waste, which in turn leads to the actual temperature and molten depth being over-estimated in the executed simulations. © 2021 Engineers Australia.","additive manufacturing;

However, for the non-weldable superalloys like Inconel 738, cracking frequently occurs during DED and cannot be thoroughly controlled up to now. We propose a novel method to prevent the cracking during Inconel 738 DED, in which a small amount of Inconel 718 is in-situ doped between the deposited layers of Inconel 738. The obtained layered-gradient-material is found to be free of both macro- and micro-cracks. The microstructure shows that doping Inconel 718 cannot interrupt the epitaxial growth of grains, but can modify the precipitation of γ′. In Inconel 718 layers, nano γ′ particles are intensively precipitated only in the inter-dendrites, while in Inconel 738 layers, they are precipitated in both the inter- and inner-dendrites. This modification on γ′ precipitation can effectively decrease the inner stress and alleviate the stress concentration at the grain boundaries, thus the cracking is prevented. The tensile tests, which were conducted at room temperature, 600 °C and 800 °C respectively, demonstrate that the composite deposited workpieces possess promising strength and plasticity. The proposed method has great potential to improve the printability of un-weldable superalloys in additive manufacturing. © 2020 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Cracking; Directed energy deposition; Inconel 718; Inconel 738","3D printers; Dendrites (metallography); Deposition; Grain boundaries; Semiconductor doping; Superalloys; Tensile testing; Deposited layer; Directed energy; Gradient materials; In-situ doping; Inconel-718; Inner stress; Ni-based superalloys; Strength and plasticities; Nickel alloys","","","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFC0310400); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","The authors wish to acknowledge the support from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2018YFC0310400 ).","Herzog D., Seyda V., Wycisk E., Emmelmann C., Additive manufacturing of metals, Acta Mater., 117, pp. 371-392, (2016); Hosseini E., Popovich V.A., A review of mechanical properties of additively manufactured Inconel 718, Addit.

These terms are related to the fourth industrial revolution that emphasizes automation and data exchange between manufacturing tools/elements. Communication occurs between machines, products and even technicians or operators through various technologies while creating records of each interaction resulting in rapid growth of amount of data to be stored. Data acquisition is not a major issue since a structure or framework can properly connect these data in improving manufacturing efficiency. However, lack of effort in collecting and storing manufacturing data in the whole product life cycle process has made integration to be almost difficult to achieve. In this study, the adoption of STEP-NC method/technique was demonstrated in suiting the current explosion of big data in the industrial and manufacturing sector. The proposed methodology was developed through a study of an entity file structure and hierarchical concept in STEP and STEP-NC in gathering manufacturing data in a unified database. The challenge would be in making sense of the data, revealing the patterns in it and using them for operational improvements. The outcome of this study will be useful to support strategic decision making in product manufacturing. © 2021 UTHM Publisher.

This study aims to explore the dissolution behaviour of natural biosilica isolated from a freshwater diatom, Cyclotella meneghiniana, that has been incorporated into 3D printed poly (DL-lactide -co – glycolide) (PDLGA) scaffolds using extrusion and additive manufacturing. In the study, two different dry weight percentage (1 wt% & 5 wt%) of diatom-silica were incorporated into PDLGA scaffolds that were then degraded in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) cell free media. In addition, pure PDLGA scaffolds and 5 wt% Bioglass scaffolds were used as control groups. The degradation study was performed over 26-weeks. The release rate of Si4+ ions from diatom-PDLGA scaffolds was found to increase exponentially with respect to time. The compressive strength of scaffolds was also measured with the Diatom–PDLGA scaffolds found to maintain their strength for longer than either pure PDLGA scaffolds or 5 wt% Bioglass scaffolds. 13C NMR data showed that diatom biosilica containing scaffolds had less degradation than pure or bioglass-containing scaffolds at comparable time-points. Overall, the Diatom-PDLGA scaffolds were found to have more desirable physiochemical properties for bone repair compared to Bioglass. © 2020","Additive manufacture; Bone repair; Diatom-silica; FDM; PDLGA","Biocompatible Materials; Ceramics; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; Bone; Calcium phosphate; Compressive strength; Scaffolds (biology); Silica; Bioglass; biomaterial; Bioglass scaffolds; Bone tissue engineering; Calcium phosphate ceramics; Degradation behaviours; Dissolution behaviour; Freshwater diatoms; Phosphate-buffered salines; Physio-chemical properties; ceramics; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; 3D printers","","Biocompatible Materials, ; Bioglass, ","","","Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Ireland, DCENR","Funding by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Ireland (Beaufort Marine Biodiscovery Programme).

The joint comprises two semicircular rotary actuators with positive and negative symmetrical distributions and a pneumatic brake. As such, it achieves forward and reverse rotations, and its damping and braking are adjustable in real time, enabling it to maintain its position. According to the force/torque balance at the free end of the rotary actuator, the rotation angle static model was established. The relationship between the actuator rotation angle, driving torque, impedance torque, and air pressure was obtained experimentally. The brake airbag was manufactured using additive manufacturing and silicone gel casting technologies. The mathematical model of the braking torque was established next, and the model was verified through experiments. Furthermore, an experimental system was constructed to carry out the air pressure-angle, air pressure-torque, and speed response experiments without the load on the joint. The results have shown that the joint can achieve any position within ± 68.5° when the driving air pressure varies from 0 to 0.30 MPa; the time required to reach the maximum angle was 0.85 s. The joint has shown good adjustable damping characteristics. Lastly, the braking torque reached 4.21 Nm at 0.32 MPa, effectively maintaining the position.  © 2021 Hongbo Liu et al.","","Brakes; Damping; Human robot interaction; Pneumatic actuators; Pneumatics; Silicones; Torque; Air-pressure; Braking torque; Environmental adaptability; Flexible joints; Humaninteraction; Rotary actuator; Rotary joint; Rotation angles; Service robots; Structure and performance; Atmospheric pressure","","","","","Jilin Province Science and Technology Development Program, (20180201050GX, 20200301040RQ); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51206011, 51275004, U1937201); Education Department of Jilin Province, (JJKH20190541KJ, JJKH20190640KJ)","The authors would like to thank the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (nos. 51275004, 51206011, and U1937201), Jilin Province Science and Technology Development Program (nos. 20200301040RQ and 20180201050GX), and Project of Education Department of Jilin Province (nos.

A model describing the behavior of the tuning mechanism has been proposed and experimentally validated as well as a suitable design flow is presented through case studies. The device under test, whose dimensions are in the mesoscale, adopts a resistive sensing readout strategy implemented through strain gauges, directly inkjet printed on the flexures (springs) supporting the central membrane. The tuning mechanism, which exploits the interaction between an external magnetic field and a magnetic fluid (ferrofluid) embedded in the device's springs, has been experimentally investigated by using a lab-scale prototype. The procedure for the optimal design of the sensor has also been addressed. The prototype shows a responsivity of 721.0 \mu strain/m/s2 at the resonance frequency of 30.5 Hz and a noise floor of 7.5e - 5 { \text {m/}}\text {s}^{{2}} {/}\sqrt {\text {Hz}} estimated in a bandwidth of 500 Hz. Responsivities of 657.0∼\mu strain/m/s2 and 580.0∼\mu strain/m/s2 as well as noise floor of 8.7e - 5 { \text {m/}}\text {s}^{{2}} {/}\sqrt {\text {Hz}} and 10.9e - 5 { \text {m/}}\text {s}^{{2}} {/}\sqrt {\text {Hz}} have been estimated in case of the tuning magnetic fields of H =6.8\text{e}-3 T and H =11.4\text{e}-3 T, respectively, showing resonance frequencies of 31.0 and 32.5 Hz. The main novelty of the proposed approach arises from the tuning strategy that is important for many real applications requiring a fine-tuning of the sensor parameters while the use of a cheap inkjet printing technology for the device realization represents a substantial advantage in terms of costs and to enable the rapid prototyping of customizable devices on flexible substrates.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Accelerometer; ferrofluid; inkjet printing; magnetic tuning; optimal design; resonant sensor","Flexible structures; Floors; Magnetic fields; Natural frequencies; Springs (components); Device under test; External magnetic field; Flexible substrate; Ink-jet printing technologies; Novel methodology; Real applications; Resonance frequencies; Resonant accelerometer; Accelerometers","","","","","","","Ando B., Baglio S., L'Episcopo G., Marletta V., Savalli N., Trigona C., A BE-SOI MEMS for inertial measurement in geophysical applications, IEEE Trans.

Mass of engineered microvessels is required to deliver nutrients to the cells included in the constructed large three-dimensional (3D) functional tissues by diffusion. It is a formidable challenge to regenerate microvessels and build a microvascular network, mimicking the cellular viabilities and activities in the engineered organs with traditional or existing manufacturing techniques. Modular tissue engineering adopting the “bottom-up” approach builds one-dimensional (1D) or two-dimensional (2D) modular tissues in micro scale first and then uses these modules as building blocks to generate large tissues and organs with complex but indispensable microstructural features. Building the microvascular network utilizing this approach could be appropriate and adequate. In this review, we introduced existing methods using the “bottom-up” concept developed to fabricate microvessels including bio-assembling powered by different micromanipulation techniques and bioprinting utilizing varied solidification mechanisms. We compared and discussed the features of the artificial microvessels engineered by these two strategies from multiple aspects. Regarding the future development of engineering the microvessels from the bottom up, potential directions were also concluded. © 2021 Liu, et al.

We compare three capacity allocation policies in the presence of supply disruption, with both full and partial disruption cases investigated. The results show that the two-stage policy outperforms other capacity allocation policies when a disruption is anticipated and that partial disruption is more manageable than full disruption in terms of meeting the SLAs. Furthermore, the supplier is better off to negotiate a longer performance review period assuming the penalty per time unit is fixed. This result is contrary to findings in the literature for SLAs when there is no consideration of disruption.

In this paper, the underwater thin-walled Ti-6Al-4V part was built firstly by underwater laser metal deposition (ULMD), and the formability, grain growth and microstructure transformation were investigated. The stable local dry cavity and the shielding-gas flow layer surrounding the deposited layer formed during the ULMD process utilizing an improved ULMD nozzle, generating the uniform thin-walled part without cracks and pores. Columnar β-grains, growing epitaxially opposite to the heat flow direction, were observed in the whole ULMD part, and the grain size increased firstly and then reduced with increasing the deposition layer, attributed to the comparative growth and decreasing cooling rate. The water cooling effect suppressed the formation of equiaxed β grains that only formed in the top region of ULMD part. For the microstructures of ULMD sample, only acicular martensites α' with different size scales formed in the bottom region, and martensites α' were replaced gradually by α phase with lamellar, lathy and blocky shapes with increasing the building height, except the top region because the absence of multiple thermal cycles. The larger cooling rate promoted the formation of α' martensite and decreased the width of α lath of ULMD part. © 2020 The Authors","Formability; Grain growth; Microstructure evolution; Ti-6Al-4V; Underwater laser metal deposition","3D printers; Additives; Cooling; Deposition; Flow of gases; Formability; Grain growth; Martensite; Ternary alloys; Textures; Thin walled structures; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Deposited layer; Deposition layers; Different sizes; Laser additive manufacturing; Laser metal deposition; Micro-structure evolutions; Microstructure transformations; Thin-walled parts; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Key Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong, (2016ZDJS05A07, 2017CXGC0922, 2018GGX103003); Key Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, (ZR2017PEE010, ZR2017QEE005); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (HIT.MKSTISP.201617, HIT.NSRIF.201602, HIT.NSRIF.201704); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","The authors thanks to the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. HIT.NSRIF.201602 , HIT.NSRIF.201704 , HIT.MKSTISP.201617 ), the Shandong Provincial Key Research and Development Plan (Grant No. 2016ZDJS05A07 , 2017CXGC0922 , 2018GGX103003 ) and Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (Grant No. ZR2017QEE005 , ZR2017PEE010 ).","Akbari M., Saedodin S., Toghraie D., Shoja-Razavi R., Kowsari F., Experimental and numerical investigation of temperature distribution and melt pool geometry during pulsed laser welding of Ti-6Al-4V alloy, Opt.

This paper proposes a new design of lightweight-graded lattice structures to replace the internal solid volume of the turbine blade to increase its endurance of high thermal stresses effects. The microstructure design of unit cells in a 3D framework is conducted by using the lattice structure topology optimization (LSTO) technique. The role of the LSTO is to find an optimal density distribution of lattice structures in the design space under specific stress constraints and fill the inner solid part of the blade with graded lattice structures. The derived implicit surfaces modelling is used from a triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) to optimize the mechanical performances of lattice structures. Numerical results show the validity of the proposed method. The effectiveness and robustness of the constructed models are analysed by using finite element analysis. The simulation results show that the graded lattice structures in the improved designs have better efficiency in terms of lightweight (33.41–40.32%), stress (25.52–48.55%) and deformation (7.35–19.58%) compared to the initial design. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","additive manufacture;

Therefore, to prevent the generation of cadmium oxide, Cd was replaced by Sn in the Al-Cu alloy (ZL205A) in the present paper. The microstructure and mechanical properties of Al-Cu-Sn alloy and the ZL205A alloy walls in as-deposited and T6 state were investigated and compared by conducting metallographic, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and tensile tests. The surface of the Al-Cu-Sn alloy wall is smooth and exhibits a silver-white luster, and the burning loss rate of Sn is 5.9%. The grains of the WAAM Al-Cu-Sn alloy wall are fine and uniform, which are smaller than these of the ZL205A alloy wall. The main precipitated phases are uniformly distributed among the grains or on the grain boundaries. Following T6 heat treatment, the θ phases are completely dissolved in the Al matrix, and the re-melted T phases and small co-phases of Sn and Al2Cu are uniformly distributed on the grain boundaries. The TEM results show that a large number of θ' phases are dispersed among the grains. The mechanical properties of the Al-Cu-Sn alloy after heat treatment are as follows: tensile strength 493 MPa, yield strength 434 MPa, and elongation rate 9.5%. The alloy shows excellent performance in WAAM process and has broad application prospects. Copyright © 2021, Northwest Institute for Nonferrous Metal Research. Published by Science Press.

With the rapid development of sensor technology, a large amount of high-dimensional data such as image streams can be easily available. Thus, a promising application of manifold learning is in the field of sensor signal analysis, particular for the applications of online process monitoring and control using high-dimensional data. The objective of this study is to develop a manifold learning-based feature extraction method for process monitoring of Additive Manufacturing (AM) using online sensor data. Due to the non-parametric nature of most existing manifold learning methods, their performance in terms of computational efficiency, as well as noise resistance has yet to be improved. To address this issue, this study proposes an integrated manifold learning approach termed multi-kernel metric learning embedded isometric feature mapping (MKML-ISOMAP) for dimension reduction and feature extraction of online high-dimensional sensor data such as images. Based on the extracted features with the utilization of supervised classification and regression methods, an online process monitoring methodology for AM is implemented to identify the actual process quality status. In the numerical simulation and real-world case studies, the proposed method demonstrates excellent performance in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. © Copyright © 2021 “IISE”.","Additive manufacturing; integrated manifold learning; isometric feature mapping (ISOMAP); multi-kernel metric learning (MKML); online process monitoring","3D printers; Additives; Amplitude modulation; Clustering algorithms; Computational efficiency; Data mining; Data streams; Dimensionality reduction; E-learning; Efficiency; Extraction; Feature extraction; Numerical methods; Process control; Process monitoring; Regression analysis; Effective dimensions; Feature extraction techniques; High dimensional data; High-dimensional data analysis; Isometric feature mapping; On-line process monitoring; On-line process monitoring and controls; Supervised classification; Learning systems","","","","","Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; National Science Foundation, NSF, (CMMI 1436592, CMMI 1436592); National Science Foundation, NSF; Advanced Manufacturing Office, AMO, (DE-AC05- 00OR22725); Advanced Manufacturing Office, AMO; Office of Naval Research, ONR, (N00014-18-1-2794); Office of Naval Research, ONR","The research reported in this publication was supported by the National Science Foundation under Award Number CMMI 1436592 and the Office of Naval Research under Award Number N00014-18-1-2794.

The study was performed by inserting a 3-D-printed Nb post inside an aluminum cylindrical cavity, forming a 3-D lumped element reentrant microwave cavity resonator. The resonator was cooled to temperatures below the critical temperature of niobium (9.25 K) and then aluminum (1.2 K) while measuring the quality factors of the electromagnetic resonances. This was then compared with finite element analysis of the cavity and a measurement of the same cavity with an aluminum post of similar dimensions and frequency, to extract the surface resistance of the niobium post. The 3-D-printed niobium exhibited a transition to the superconducting state below 9.25 K, as well as a surface resistance of 3.1 ± 0.54 × 10-4 Ω. This value was comparable to many samples of traditionally machined niobium previously studied without specialized surface treatment. Furthermore, this study demonstrates a simple new method for characterizing the material properties of a relatively small and geometrically simple sample of the superconductor, which could be easily applied to other materials, particularly 3-D-printed materials. Further research and development in additive manufacturing may see the application of 3-D-printed niobium in not only superconducting cavity designs but also in the innovative technology of the future. © 2020 IEEE.","Electrical resistance measurement; microwave measurement; superconducting materials; superconductivity; surface resistance; three-dimensional printing","3D printers; Aluminum; Industrial research; Microwave resonators; Niobium; Surface resistance; Surface treatment; Critical temperatures; Cryogenic material properties; Electromagnetic resonance; Experimental characterization; Microwave cavity resonators; Research and development; Superconducting cavities; Superconducting state; Acoustic resonators","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (CE170100009); Australian Research Council, ARC","Manuscript received May 10, 2020; revised September 21, 2020; accepted September 25, 2020.

In this study, high-magnification schlieren imaging was employed to visualise the interactions between the cross-flow, laser plume and individual powder particles for the first time. Novel 3D multiphysics simulations of the cross-flow, including the vapour jet and laser plume, were used to calculate energy, momentum and species transport over the processed area in order to understand and quantify the observed interactions. During processing, metallic fumes as well as a significant number of airborne powder particles and agglomerates were observed to remain close to the powder bed, over the scanned area. These particles interact in a range of stochastic collisions that affect the build consistency. Refractive index gradients were formed in the atmosphere above the island scans, which extended many tens of mm beyond the processing area. The rate of extraction of these by-products, regulated by the velocity of the cross-flow, was related to the quality of the builds. A cross-flow perpendicular to the laser scan direction was observed to remove airborne particles from adjacent laser scans most effectively, limiting laser-particle and particle-particle interactions. The model demonstrated that the refractive index gradients away from the vapour jet are due to the metal concentration rather than the temperature of the heated gas. © 2020 The Authors","Cross-flows; High-speed imaging; Powder consolidation; Schlieren imaging; Theory and modelling (kinetics, transport, diffusion)","3D printers; Inert gases; Refractive index; Stochastic systems; High magnifications; Laser scan directions; Metal concentrations; Multiphysics simulations; Particle-particle interactions; Process repeatability; Refractive index gradients; Schlieren imaging; Powder metals","","","","","Renishaw; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/P027415/1)","The authors are grateful to Tim Nicholls of Photron (Europe) Ltd. for use of the Photron Fastcam Mini AX200 camera.

(2012) produce better bit error rate (BER) and SI error rate (SIER) performance compared to binary codes. However, the authors do not provide details for code generation; instead, they list some codes with a length of u/2 and a minimum Hamming distance of u/4. The suggested bi-orthogonal code does not work for any value of the maximum iteration number u other than (formula Presented). Therefore, this paper proposes two algorithms for generating u codes for any value of u. The proposed methods maintain the normalized minimum Hamming distance between generated codes to 0.5. However, the second proposed algorithm, which works in the case of (formula Presented), is also able to only consider codes with a maximum Hamming distance, allowing it to improve SIER performance. Thus, the second proposed algorithm improves SIER performance by up to 1 dB at Eb/No=3dB. Furthermore, the proposed algorithms are able to generate a multiple set of u codes that deliver same performance. © 2021, International Journal of Technology.

Heterogeneous structuring in these materials has the potential to unlock extrinsic mechanisms that improve damage tolerance, of vital importance for structural functionality. However, traditional ceramic powder processing and forming techniques limit the design space to simple geometries with chemically homogenous microstructures. Thus, additive manufacturing by direct ink writing (DIW) was applied to fabricate multi-phase carbide specimens with tailored composition and mesostructure. A custom DIW system was developed to allow simultaneous extrusion and mixing of multiple inks, comprised of ceramic particulate suspensions, through a single nozzle. Boron carbide (B4C) and silicon carbide (SiC) were chosen for this study due to their excellent mechanical properties. Aqueous B4C and SiC inks were loaded to 47.5 vol% ceramic content and showed yield-pseudoplastic behavior. The carbide inks were characterized and modified to exhibit similar rheological behavior (yield stress and viscosity), and were used to produce B4C–SiC parts with either discrete or continuous composition variation. Specimens were hot pressed at 35 MPa and 1950 °C, yielding near full density with hardness (Knoop) values of 20–23 GPa. Tailored heterogeneity, achieved via active in-line mixing, is revealed through microstructural characterization. Cracking observed in the specimen with discretely varied composition is the result of thermally-induced residual stress, and is elucidated through analytical calculations. © 2020","Active mixing; Carbides; Functional grading; Heterogeneous; Material extrusion","3D printers; Additives; Ceramics industry; High temperature applications; High temperature corrosion; Mixing; Silicon carbide; Yield stress; Analytical calculation; Composition variation; High-temperature environment; Micro-structural characterization; Rheological behaviors; Silicon carbides (SiC); Structural functionality; Traditional ceramics; Boron carbide","","","","","U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Army Research Laboratory; UCSD Center for High Energy Density Science; Office of the President, University of California, UCOP, (LFR-17-449059); U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, CCDC, (W911NF-19-2-0054)","Funding text 1: This research was sponsored by the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Army Research Laboratory and was accomplished under Cooperative Agreement Number W911NF-19-2-0054 .

In fact, these TSCNs achieve a fair degree of customization through parts standardization in parts and product range with available specific customized parts. Yet, true customization remains unattainable in TSCNs, at least in terms of economy of scale. 3D printing integration in supply chains can make them truly agile by offering product customizations only on necessity, thereby eliminating the need for producing unwanted parts. The proposed research study investigates the logistical implications of integrating Additive Manufacturing (AM) in the healthcare industry supply chain, and examines the impacts and subsequent results obtained by simulation analysis. The resultant supply chain is referred to as 3DPSCN (3D Printing integrated Supply Chain Network). Simulation models of the related healthcare supply chains, both Traditional (TSCN) and 3D printing integrated (3DPSCN), are developed using data gathered from available resources and real-time observations. Ultimately, a comparative study is done by simulation analysis. The main contribution of this paper is to propose of an optimized supply chain simulation model that incorporates AM in the manufacturing of a hearing aid prosthetic. The results of the analysis elaborate the benefits obtainable such as lead-time reduction, waste reduction, and number of customers served. © 2021 The Chinese Institute of Engineers.","Additive manufacturing; design for supply chain; design of 3D printing; product customization; simulation analysis","Additives; Audition; Health care; Hearing aids; Industrial research; Supply chains; Healthcare industry; Integrated supply chain networks; Number of customers served; Product customization; Real time observation; Supply chain network; Supply chain simulation; Traditional manufacturing; 3D printers","","","","","LSU College of Engineering","The authors are grateful for the support rendered by KLN College of Engineering.

Layer-wise contour deviation assessment could be critical for dimensional and geometrical quality improvement of AM parts, because it would allow for close-loop error compensation strategies. Nevertheless, contour characterisation feasibility faces many challenges, such as image distortion compensation or edge detection quality. The present work evaluates the influence of image processing and layerto-background contrast characteristics upon contour reconstruction quality, under a metrological perspective. Considered factors include noise filtering, edge detection algorithms, and threshold levels, whereas the distance between the target layer and the background is used to generate different contrast scenarios. Completeness of contour reconstruction is evaluated by means of a coverage factor, whereas its accuracy is determined by comparison with a reference contour digitised in a coordinate measuring machine. Results show that a reliable contour characterisation can be achieved by means of a precise adjustment of image processing parameters under low layer-to-background contrast variability. Conversely, under anisotropic contrast conditions, the quality of contour reconstruction severely drops, and the compromise between coverage and accuracy becomes unbalanced. These findings indicate that FBS-based characterisation of AM layers will demand developing strategies that minimise the influence of anisotropy in layer-to-background contrast. © 2020 by the authors.

Here, we addressed the long-term safety and stability issues associated with 3D-bioprinted constructs comprising a cellulose scaffold and human cells (chondrocytes and stem cells) over a period of 10 months in nude mice. Our findings showed that increasing unconfined compression strength over time significantly improved the mechanical stability of the cell-containing constructs relative to cell-free scaffolds. Additionally, the cell-free constructs exhibited a mean compressive stress and stiffness (compressive modulus) of 0.04 ± 0.05 MPa and 0.14 ± 0.18 MPa, respectively, whereas these values for the cell-containing constructs were 0.11 ± 0.08 MPa (p =.019) and 0.53 ± 0.59 MPa (p =.012), respectively. Moreover, histomorphologic analysis revealed that cartilage formed from the cell-containing constructs harbored an abundance of proliferating chondrocytes in clusters, and after 10 months, resembled native cartilage. Furthermore, extension of the experiment over the complete lifecycle of the animal model revealed no signs of ossification, fibrosis, necrosis, or implant-related tumor development in the 3D-bioprinted constructs. These findings confirm the in vivo biological safety and mechanical stability of 3D-bioprinted cartilaginous tissues and support their potential translation into clinical applications. © 2020 The Authors.

The main biological approach for designing was bio-inspiration. However, links and examples implementing bio-integration and bio-intelligence were also considered and analyzed during the investigation. The paper describes a systematic design procedure starting from requirements and applications related to manufacturing, using well-known theories and experience in engineering, however analyzing and applying biological materials, properties, structures, phenomena and complete systems. Sustainability aspects combined with the immense and ever growing capacity of ICT and digitization possibilities provided new options for design methodologies. A moveable and flexible machine tool was virtually used as a demonstrator to describe the new methodology. It was proved that the ongoing process of learning from nature and applying biological phenomena, structures and materials, together with new technologies such as Additive Manufacturing (AM) can develop new ideas, processes, manufacturing systems, and products with benefits to performance, productivity, efficiency and sustainability. Nature and biological domains can be integrated, can inspire, be implemented or even applied as an intelligent system in the design procedure. © 2020 CIRP","Bio-inspiration; Bio-intelligence; Biological approach; Biologicalization; Design methodologies; Manufacturing systems","3D printers; Aerospace industry; Biological materials; Engineering education; Intelligent systems; Machine tools; Sustainable development; Biological approach; Biological domain; Biological phenomena; Design and application; Design Methodology; Flexible machines; Process of learning; Systematic designs; Product design","","","","","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF; Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, Fraunhofer","The authors thank the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) for their support in the research project m2FLEX “Miniaturized parallel kinematic production systems for the flexible machining of precision components”.

As shown by few experimental investigations, the layer-by-layer deposition induces a remarkable anisotropy in the elastic response of the WAAM-produced alloys. A suitable topology optimization technique is implemented to account for this peculiar behavior of the material, which is generally disregarded in design tools that are conceived for traditional manufacturing. First, an orthotropic material model is derived from the data of an experimental investigation that was recently performed on alloys made with 308LSi stainless steel wire feed. Then, an optimization procedure is implemented that exploits, as design variables, not only the density field of an orthotropic material phase, but also the orientation of the symmetry axes of such material with respect to a reference frame (i.e. the printing direction used to build the whole structural element). Minimum weight problems with displacement constraints are solved to find optimal solutions that are compared to those achieved by performing topology optimization with (i) isotropic stainless steel or with (ii) the WAAM-produced alloy for prescribed orientations. Numerical simulations assess that the printing direction remarkably affects the stiffness of the optimal layouts, as well as their topology. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","3D printing; Build orientation; Orthotropic material;

The Foundational Fuel Chemistry Model (FFCM) was employed to perform the simulations for different initial pressures and temperatures, for volumetric mixtures of 0-100% hydrogen in the fuel mixture. For cases with 25-80% of hydrogen in the fuel mixture three stages of annihilation were observed. The first stage showed a gradual flame extinction coupled with the generation of a pressure wave with a long wavelength. The second stage featured a more rapid extinction as the flame accelerates towards the symmetry axis, producing a sharp pressure drop. The final stage demonstrated a gradual decrease in pressure due to slow reactions such as CO oxidation. The contribution of the first stage increased as more hydrogen was added to the fuel. These stages were not distinctive when the fuel was pure hydrogen. The time derivative of the heat release rate was verified to be the dominant source of sound for annihilation events. A correlation linking the sound amplitude from planar annihilation events to key flame parameters was demonstrated to work for the studied fuel blends. The FFCM was then reduced using a modified Directed Relation Graph with Error Propagation and Sensitivity Analysis (DRGEPSA) method with error bounds based on the laminar flame speed, sL. A good agreement was observed between the sL predictions for the reduced and the detailed mechanisms. The developed reduced mechanisms in this study also accurately predicted the generated sound by flame annihilation.","Chemical kinetic mechanism reduction; Combustion generated sound; Direct numerical simulation; Directed relation graph with error Propagation; Hydrogen-methane blends; Sensitivity analysis (DRGEPSA)","Chemical analysis; Combustion; Directed graphs; Hydrogen; Methane; Chemical kinetic mechanism; Chemical kinetic mechanism reduction; Combustion generated sound; Direct-numerical-simulation; Directed relation graph; Directed relation graph with error propagation; Error propagation; Hydrogen methane blends; Mechanism reduction; Sensitivity analyse (DRGEPSA); Sensitivity analysis","","","","","Australian Governments Cooperative Research Centres Program; Australian Government; National Computational Infrastructure, NCI; Government of Western Australia, WA Government; Australian Research Council, ARC, (DE180100416)","This work is funded by the Future Fuels CRC, supported through the Australian Governments Cooperative Research Centres Program.

However, an understanding of their properties and behavior in corrosive environments has not yet been achieved. This is due to a lack of methodology used to study the morphology of interior surfaces in porous materials. Thus, this research investigates the corrosion characteristics of three-dimensional-printed stainless steels made with five volume printing powers. Accelerated corrosion experiments were conducted at 35°C-40°C under atmospheric pressure in salt fog under predesigned durations. Electrochemical study was carried out with a potentiostat. Tomographic studies were conducted using a scanning electron microscope and micro X-ray computed tomography technology to analyze the effects of corrosion. Results revealed three findings. First, corrosion took place internally for all additively manufactured stainless steel samples regardless of printing parameters. Second, localized corrosion between printed layers was most pronounced. Third, elongated and oriented internal pits formed during corrosion and were associated with a dendritelike structure, which is different from the conventional understanding of subsurface pitting directed by gravity. This research not only generates new knowledge on additively manufactured stainless steels but also opens new revenues for future investigation on the design and additive manufacturing of metals and alloys. © 2021 ASTM International.

However, the current standard of care soft tissue repair meshes for hernia repair is highly inflammatory and initiates a dysregulated inflammatory process causing visceral adhesions and postsurgical complications. Herein, the development of an inflammation modulating biomaterial scaffold (bioscaffold) for soft tissue repair is presented. The bioscaffold design is based on the idea that, if the excess proinflammatory cytokines are sequestered from the site of injury by the surgical implantation of a bioscaffold, the inflammatory response can be modulated, and the visceral adhesion formations and postsurgical complications can be minimized. The bioscaffold is fabricated by 3D-bioprinting of an in situ phosphate crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer. In vivo efficacy of the bioscaffold is evaluated in a rat ventral hernia model. In vivo proinflammatory cytokine expression analysis and histopathological analysis of the tissues have confirmed that the bioscaffold acts as an inflammation trap and captures the proinflammatory cytokines secreted at the implant site and effectively modulates the local inflammation without the need for exogenous anti-inflammatory agents. The bioscaffold is very effective in inhibiting visceral adhesions formation and minimizing postsurgical complications. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","3D-bioprinting; bioscaffolds; hernia; inflammation; soft tissue repair","Animals; Bioprinting; Hernia, Ventral; Inflammation; Polymers; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Rats; 3D printers; Adhesion; Pathology; Polymeric implants; Polyvinyl alcohols; Tissue; Tissue regeneration; polymer; Adhesion formations; Anti-inflammatory agents; Biomaterial scaffolds; Histopathological analysis; Inflammatory process; Inflammatory response; Pro-inflammatory cytokines; Standard of cares; abdominal wall hernia; animal; bioprinting; chemistry; inflammation; pathology; rat; three dimensional printing; Scaffolds (biology)","","Polymers, ","","","Michael E.

However, it is challenging to develop a bilayered scaffold with anisotropic structural properties to mimic a native osteochondral tissue. Herein, we developed a bioink consisting of decellularized extracellular matrix and silk fibroin to print the bilayered scaffold. The bilayered scaffold mimics the natural osteochondral tissue by controlling the composition, mechanical properties, and growth factor release in each layer of the scaffold. The in vitro results show that each layer of scaffolds had a suitable mechanical strength and degradation rate. Furthermore, the scaffolds encapsulating transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) can act as a controlled release system and promote directed differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Furthermore, the in vivo experiments suggested that the scaffolds loaded with growth factors promoted osteochondral regeneration in the rabbit knee joint model. Consequently, the biomimetic bilayered scaffold loaded with TGF-β and BMP-2 would be a promising strategy for osteochondral repair. © 2021.

To eliminate the conflict between data privacy and computability, homomorphism is extensively researched due to its capacity of performing operations over ciphertexts. Considering that the data provided by a single party are not always adequate to derive a competent model via machine learning, we proposed a privacy-preserving training method for the neural network over multiple data providers. Moreover, taking the trainer's intellectual property into account, our scheme also achieved the goal of model parameter protection. Thanks to the hardness of the conjugate search problem (CSP) and discrete logarithm problem (DLP), the confidentiality of training data and system model can be reduced to well-studied security assumptions. In terms of efficiency, since all messages are coded as low-dimensional matrices, the expansion rates with regard to storage and computation overheads are linear compared to plaintext implementation without accuracy loss. In reality, our method can be transplanted to any machine learning system involving multiple parties due to its capacity of fully homomorphic computation.  © 2021 Fengtian Kuang et al.","","Digital storage;

Powders display a complex behaviour due to their ability to rearrange under stress, and as a result, granular flow is generally classified into three flow regimes, namely a quasi-static regime dominated by frictional contacts, an inertial regime dominated by collisional and kinematic stresses and an intermediate regime where the three sources of stress are important to establish a stress-strain rate relationship. Characterisation of the flowability is generally restricted to the flow initiation in quasi-static regime, even if, transition into inertial conditions is very common in practical applications involving the control of dense flows, such as powder handling, particle formation processes or additive manufacturing. This work presents a critical review of available techniques to characterise the departure from the quasi-static regime into an intermediate flow. We revise the application of shear cells and present different strategies to modify classic devices with external actuation, such as aeration, to operate at higher inertial numbers. We pay particular attention to innovative designs using aerated Couette flow configurations, highlight the complexity in the standardisation and the challenges in advancing towards a universal model. © 2021 The Authors.","Aeration; Characterisation; Couette flow; Flowability; Granular rheology; Shear cell","3D printers; Granular materials; Product design; Stress-strain curves; Frictional contact; Innovative design; Intermediate flow; Intermediate regimes; Particle formation process; Quasi-static regime; Shear cell devices; Stress strain rate; Strain rate","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC","RO acknowledges financial support from the EPSRC","Ait-Kadi A., Marchal P., Choplin L., Chrissemant A.-S., Bousmina M., Quantitative analysis of mixer-type rheom-eters using the Couette analogy, The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering, 80, pp. 1166-1174, (2002); Andreotti B., Forterre Y., Pouliquen O., Granular media: between fluid and solid, (2013); Anjaneyulu P., Khakhar D.V., Rheology of a gas-fluidized bed, Powder Technology, 83, pp. 29-34, (1995); Aranson I.S., Tsimring L.S., Continuum description of avalanches in granular media, Physical Review E, 64, (2001); Aranson I.S., Tsimring L.S., Continuum theory of partially fluid-ized granular flows, Physical Review E, 65, (2002); Bagnold R., Experiments on a gravity-free dispersion of large solid spheres in a Newtonian fluid under shear, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

Mindful design can remove much of this support; however, well-selected build orientations are still essential. Searching all feasible orientations is inefficient due to the large number of faces in many mesh files. Nevertheless, support structure generation forms a critical part of the AM process planning stage. This research uses novel combinations of proxy evaluation criteria models for support estimation and optimisation methods to minimise support structure. The number of overhanging facets, overall support structure length and a new estimate for the volume of support structure are used in place of a precise calculation of support quantity. These proxies are used within three different optimisation schemes: grid search, random search and Bayesian optimisations (BO). BO is found to out-perform random and grid search techniques, with grid search having the worst performance in most cases, requiring up to 17-times fewer optimisation iterations. The overall length of support is the most effective proxy model, even outperforming the volume of support estimation, and is shown to perform within 3.5% of results benchmarked against commercial software. © 2021 The Author(s).

However, these solutions are usually expensive and, consequently, inaccessible outside of professional medical institutions. Rapid advances in software development, Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, and additive manufacturing open up a way to affordable rehabilitation solutions, even to the general population. Imagine a rehabilitation aid constructed from accessible software and hardware with local production. Many obstacles exist to using such technology, starting with the development of unified software for custom-made devices. In this paper, we address open issues in designing rehabilitation aids by proposing an extensive rehabilitation platform. To demonstrate our concept, we developed a unique platform, RehabHand. The main idea is to use domain-specific language and code generation techniques to enable loosely coupled software and hardware solutions. The main advantage of such separation is support for modular and a higher abstraction level by enabling therapists to write rehabilitation exercises in natural, domain-specific terminology and share them with patients. The same platform provides a hardware-independent part that facilitates the integration of new rehabilitation devices. Experience in implementing RehabHand with three different rehabilitation devices confirms that such rehabilitation technology can be developed, and shows that implementing a hardware-independent rehabilitation platform might not be as challenging as expected. © 2021 by the authors.

In contrast to full-data MWI inversion that uses complex (magnitude and phase) scattered field data, the proposed PGNI algorithm inverts phaseless (magnitude-only) total field data. This PGNI algorithm is augmented with three different forms of regularization, originally developed for complex GNI. First, we use the standard weighted L2 norm total variation multiplicative regularizer, which is appropriate when there is no prior information about the object being imaged. We then use two other forms of regularization operators to incorporate prior information about the object being imaged into the PGNI algorithm. The first one, herein referred to as SL-PGNI, incorporates prior information about the expected relative complex permittivity values of the object of interest. The other, referred to as spatial prior PGNI (SP-PGNI), incorporates SPs (structural information) about the objects being imaged. The use of prior information aims to compensate for the lack of total field phase data. The PGNI, SL-PGNI, and SP-PGNI inversion algorithms are then tested against synthetic and experimental phaseless total field data.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Gauss-Newton inversion (GNI); inverse scattering; microwave imaging (MWI); phaseless (magnitude-only) inversion; regularization","Permittivity; Inversion algorithm; Microwave imaging; Prior information; Relative complex permittivities; Scattered field data; Spatial priors; Structural information; Total variation; Imaging systems","","","","","; Canada Research Chairs","This work was supported in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and in part by the Canada Research Chair Program grants.","Poplack S.P., Et al., Electromagnetic breast imaging: Results of a pilot study in women with abnormal mammograms, Radiology, 243, 2, pp. 350-359, (2007); Fear E.C., Hagness S.C., Meaney P.M., Okoniewski M., Stuchly M.A., Enhancing breast tumor detection with near-field imaging, Ieee Microw.

Artificial Intelligence has opened new ways to promote special education with advanced learning tools. These tools enable to adapt to a typical classroom set up for all the students with or without disabilities. To ensure social equity and the same classroom experience, a coherent solution is envisioned for inclusive education. This paper aims to propose a cost-effective and integrated Smart Learning Assistance (SLA) tool for Inclusive Education using Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques. It comprises speech to text and sign language conversion for hearing impaired students, sign language to text conversion for speech impaired students, and Braille to text for communicating with visually impaired students. The tool assists differently-abled students to make use of various teaching-learning opportunities conferred to them and ensures convenient two-way communication with the instructor and peers in the classroom thus makes learning easier. © 2021 - IOS Press.

In this context, Customer Agreements (CA) are used to regulate the service provision including, among other information, the agreed service level in SLAs, pricing, and billing terms. Although many existing proposals and industrial tools support the definition of pricing and billing of cloud services, there is a lack in terms of customisation and automated monitoring tools integrated with the billing process. In this article, we provide a flexible billing proposal supporting CA that considers not only SLA terms but also customisable pricing and billing terms, possibly including compensations (i.e. discounts or overcharges) that apply when specified conditions are met. In addition, we developed an automated monitoring and analysis tool that we validate in a real-world industrial scenario.

The advantage of subtractive techniques over additive ones is the possibility of maintaining the homogeneity and consistency of the processed material, which is extremely important in the case of medical devices. Currently, a geometrically complex medical model can be made even on a simple, 3-axis CNC machine tool. However, often the semi-finished product must be machined in at least two clamping configurations. The aim of the work is to present the method of fixing a workpiece in the process of subtractive production of geometrically complex medical objects on the example of skull bone prostheses. The paper discusses the use of two clamping systems for machining such models. It presents the process of subtractive production of bone prostheses models fitted to the defect of the skull bone with the use of the proposed methods of fixing the workpiece. The result of the work are two models of the skull bone prosthesis. A more complex model was analysed in terms of the accuracy of geometry reproduction. The research confirmed the usefulness of the proposed clamping systems for the preparation of medical models of geometrically complex anatomical structures.  © 2021 Wiktoria Wojnarowska et al., published by De Gruyter 2021.","CNC; cranioplasty; implant; machining; prosthesis","","","","","","","","Karbowski K., Banach M., Czepko R., Maslowski P., Sujka W., Inżynieria rekonstrukcyjna w modelowaniu wyrobów medycznych, Mechanik, 87, 56, pp. 472-473, (2014); Karbowski K., Moskala M., Polak J., Sujka W., Urbanik A., Zastosowanie tomografii komputerowej do opracowania protezy CODUBIX na indywidualne zamówienie pacjenta, Acta Clinica et Morphologica, 15, 2, pp. 10-16, (2012); Schirmer C.M., Ackil A.A., Malek A.M., Decompressive Craniectomy, Neurocrit Care, 8, 3, pp. 456-470, (2008); Bonda D.J., Manjila S., Selman W.R., Dean D., The Recent Revolution in the Design and Manufacture of Cranial Implants: Modern Advancements and Future Directions, Neurosurgery, 77, 5, pp. 814-824, (2015); Piazza M., Grady M.S., Cranioplasty, Neurosurg Clin N Am, 28, 2, pp. 257-265, (2017); Sanan A., Haines S.J., Repairing holes in the head: A history of cranioplasty, Neurosurgery, 40, 3, pp. 588-603, (1997); Singh S., Singh R., Jain K., Walia B., Cranioplasty following decompressive craniectomy - Analysis of complication rates and neurological outcomes: A single center study, Surg Neurol Int, 10, 142, pp. 1-7, (2019); Khader B.A., Towler M.R., Materials and techniques used in cranioplasty fixation: A review, Mater Sci Eng C Mater Biol Appl, 66, pp. 315-322, (2016); Kasendra P., Struszczyk M.H., Codubix - Oryginalny Materiał Do Zastosowań Chirurgicznych, (2004); Chrzan R., Urbanik A., Karbowski K., Moskala M., Polak J., Pyrich M., Cranioplasty prosthesis manufacturing based on reverse engineering technology, Med Sci Monit Int Med J Exp Clin Res, 18, 1, pp. MT1-MT6, (2012); Andrzejak S., Fortuniak J., Wrobel-Wisniewska G., Zawirski M., Clinical evaluation of the polypropylene-polyester knit used as a cranioplasty material, Acta Neurochir (Wien), 147, 9, pp. 973-976, (2005); Marcian P., Narra N., Borak L., Chamrad J., Wolff J., Biomechanical performance of cranial implants with different thicknesses and material properties: A finite element study, Comput Biol Med, 109, pp. 43-52, (2019); Lee S.-C., Wu C.-T., Lee S.-T., Chen P.-J., Cranioplasty using polymethyl methacrylate prostheses, J Clin Neurosci off J Neurosurg Soc Australas, 16, 1, pp. 56-63, (2009); Solaro P., Pierangeli E., Pizzoni C., Bofl P., Scalese G., From computerized tomography data processing to rapid manufacturing of custom-made prostheses for cranioplasty, Case Report.

To avoid such problems, a novel auxiliary wire feeding GMA-AM (A-GMA-AM) approach is proposed to achieve high deposition rate at low deposition current. This paper investigates the effects of A-GMA-AM when the deposition current ranges from 100 to 180 A. The process window was explored, and the influence of the feeding speed of auxiliary wire on the bead geometries and the heat-affected zone area was analyzed. It was observed that the increase in the feeding speed of the auxiliary wire can increase the bead height and remain the bead width unchanged. When the feeding speed of the auxiliary wire reaches the upper limit at the corresponding deposition current, the deposition rate of A-GMA-AM is at least 1.65 times than that of traditional GMA-AM at the same deposition current, and the heat-affected zone area is reduced by at least 28.6%. The results showed that the A-GMA-AM method is more efficient in increasing deposition rate and reducing the heat in AM components. © 2020, International Institute of Welding.","Auxiliary wire feeding; Deposition rate; Forming characteristics; Gas metal arc-based additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Deposition rates; Feeding; Forming; Gas welding; Heat affected zone; Wire; Additive manufacture; Auxiliary wire; Deposition current; Experimental investigations; Gas metal arcs; High deposition rates; Process window; Shape forming; Gas metal arc welding","","","","","Key R & D project of Guangdong Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52075121); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFB1105800); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2018B090906004)","This work was supported by Key R & D project of Guangdong Province, China (2018B090906004) , the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFB1105800), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52075121).

The basic principles of image fusion and image guidance have been widely adopted and are commercialized through a number of platforms. Although multimodal systems have been found to be useful for guiding interventional procedures, they all have their limitations. The integration of more advanced guidance techniques into the product functionality is, however, not easy due to the proprietary solutions of the vendors. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to introduce a software system for image fusion, real-time navigation, and working points documentation during transcatheter interventions performed under X-ray (XR) guidance. Methods: An interactive software system for cross-modal registration and image fusion of XR fluoroscopy with CT or MRI-derived anatomic 3D models is implemented using Qt application framework and VTK visualization pipeline. DICOM data can be imported in retrospective mode. Live XR data input is realized by a video capture card application interface. Results: The actual software release offers a graphical user interface with basic functionality including data import and handling, calculation of projection geometry and transformations between related coordinate systems, rigid 3D-3D registration, and template matching-based tracking and motion compensation algorithms in 2D and 3D. The link to the actual software release on GitHub including source code and executable is provided to support independent research and development in the field of intervention guidance. Conclusion: The introduced system provides a common foundation for the rapid prototyping of new approaches in the field of XR fluoroscopic guidance. As a pure software solution, the developed system is potentially vendor-independent and can be easily extended to be used with the XR systems of different manufacturers. © 2020, The Author(s).","Image fusion; Image-guided interventions; Multimodal visualization; Open-source software; X-ray fluoroscopy","Algorithms; Fluoroscopy; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Motion; Software; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; algorithm; Article; computer assisted surgery; computer assisted tomography; digital imaging and communications in medicine; fluoroscopy; geometry; human; image registration; measurement accuracy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; rapid prototyping; three-dimensional imaging; two-dimensional imaging; fluoroscopy; motion; procedures; software; three-dimensional imaging; x-ray computed tomography","","","","","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (BMBF-13GW0372C); Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF","This work was supported partly by the project “Multimodal 3D Navigation System for Transvascular Interventions (TRANSNAV)” granted by German Federal Ministry of Education and Research under the funding code BMBF-13GW0372C.

To improve the weight-specific stiffness and energy absorption capability of the conventional dome commonly used as the core of sandwich sheets, a new concept of filling the solid part of the dome with stretch-dominated microlattices is proposed. The optimal density distribution of microlattices is obtained by integrating the homogenization-based topology optimization method with the lattice structure. The compressive and bending stiffnesses of the optimized variable-density microlattice domes are demonstrated to be 41.8% and 33.7% higher than those of the conventional solid domes, while the energy absorption of the microlattice dome during compression and three-point bending is increased by 297.5% and 85%, respectively. Investigation of the cell size effect on the mechanical properties of the microlattice dome reveals that a larger cell size contributes more to the weight-specific stiffness and energy absorption capability at a given overall volume fraction constraint. The topology optimization and construction methods described in this paper are universal and can be used for the further development of ultralight, ultrastiff structures with arbitrary macro shapes with microlattices as constituent units. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing;

In this paper an experimental method of flyer drive by double-pulse is presented. A high speed Schlieren photography system is designed to observe the flyer and shock wave. A one-dimensional (1-D) numerical calculation model is established, which considered phase transition, absorption of laser energy, and dynamic mechanical response. The flyer motion is simulated by using the weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) finite difference method (FDM), level set equation and ghost fluid method. It is found that the double-pulse laser can effectively increase the flyer velocity and energy efficiency. At the end of laser irradiation, the aluminium film exhibits three regions: Gas phase, gas-solid mixture phase and solid phase. During the acceleration process, the flyer undergoes intense compression and tension. © 2021 Old City Publishing.

This modelling indicates that the power generated by HDR-TENG is a function of the number of segments, rotational speed, and tribo-surface spacing with different weighting sensitivities. Based on the simulation results, additive manufacturing technology was combined with commercially available components to cost-effectively fabricate the HDR-TENG. The fabricated HDR-TENG can provide stable and adjustable rotational speed up to 15,000 rpm with a linear hand stretching. The output voltage of HDR-TENG maintains a constant value within 50,000 cycles of testing when using Nylon 66 and PTFE as the triboelectric material. It can charge a 47 µF capacitor to 2.2 V in one minute. This study provides a cost-effective portable HDR-TENG device with adjustable high rotational speed, high power output, and long durable life, creating opportunities to provide a power supply for point-of-care devices in remote or resource-poor settings and applications in science and engineering education. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: Handheld optical coherence tomography was used to scan the anterior chamber of participants’ eyes, without sedation. Image J was used to generate quantitative anterior chamber measurements, including central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior chamber width, trabecular meshwork length (TML), Schwalbe’s line–angle opening distance (SL-AOD), and trabecular iris surface area (SL-TISA). The average anterior chamber measurements per age group, with 95% prediction intervals, were estimated using fractional polynomial modeling. Mixed regression models were used to evaluate the influence of age, gender, eye, angle, and refractive error variation on anterior chamber measurements. Results: Scans from 223 healthy children (2 days to 15 years of age) and 59 adults (16 to 47 years of age)were included. The anterior chamber width, TML, Schwalbe’s line–angle opening distance, and Schwalbe’s line–trabecular iris surface area significantly increased, whereas CCT decreased with aging (all P < 0.001). The anterior chamber has a rapid phase of development during the first 18 months of age and reaches maturity by the age of 5 years. Girls have significantly smaller anterior chambers compared with boys (all P < 0.001). There was no difference between right and left eye development (all P > 0.05). The temporal TML development was significantly greater than the nasal TML (P < 0.05). CCT development was negatively correlated with refractive power. Conclusions: This novel, non-invasive study describes the postnatal development of anterior chamber in newborn children. Translational Relevance: Our established quantitative measurements have potential clinical use in understanding anterior segment diseases. © 2021 The Authors.","Angle opening distance; Anterior chamber width;

Parallel Delta robots have for a long time been mainly focused on a niche market; however, compared to serial anthropomorphic robots they present several simplicity and improved dynamics features. Additive manufacturing (AM) and 3D-printing technologies are enabling rapid changes in robotic engineering as we classically know it, allowing for greater creativity and freedom in mechatronics design and innovation. The effective benefits of far-reaching design freedom in terms of geometry, materials, and manufacturing accessibility are now starting to become apparent, answering many complex technical questions and scientific uncertainties that go beyond basic design and functional knowledge and that require engineering skills and scientific analysis. The Delta robot, as one of the most significant industrialized parallel robots due to its simplicity, is considered in this work, which provides an overview of the multidisciplinary aspects of the new Smile.Tech’s 3D-printed and low-cost Delta robot, the Óscar family. We provide a concise analysis of the current state of the art and use of Delta robots, as well as a discussion of the Delta architecture, interface software, and virtual operation environments.

Up-to-date direction of WAAM investigations is aimed on production of functional metallic components with complicated geometrical shape and high accuracy, surface processing and mechanical properties meeting the strict requirements of aerospace, automotive and instrumental industries. At the same time, structural application of metal components based on their mechanical properties is studied insufficiently. It is necessary to understand additionally influence of technological conditions (such as energy input, protective gas role, speed of wire feed, welding speed, facing features and its sequence etc.) on the thermal initial parameters and finishing mechanical properties. The paper displays that mechanical properties of low-alloyed silicon-manganese composition of C-Mn-Si type with ferrite-pearlite structure is higher comparing with conventional steel 09G2S. It is shown that impact strength values for C-Mn-Si-type composition, which id formed via WAAM method, is higher by 2 times in comparison with welded joints which are faced by Sv-08G2S wire. © Balanovskiy A.

However, most schools, universities or institutions would normally purchase a commercial model from the market which is, on the one hand, good because it provides easy access for students to learn quickly. On the other hand, students only learn the design-related part of the 3D printing using various commer-cially available software. At the Additive Manufacturing Center for Mass Customization Production at the National Taipei University of Technology, students must learn how to design a 3D printing machine and work very closely with a company to manu-facture and test it themselves. Such practice helps students not only to learn/understand 3D printing technology but also apply tech-nical skills, and practice their communi-cation skills with real industry personnel. Therefore, students learn both hard and soft skills. Students at AMC come from various parts of the world, including the USA, Ger-many, India, Ecuador, Indonesia, Japan, Ko-rea, China, and New Zealand.

It was subsequently processed through solution and aging (T6) heat treatment to improve its performance. There were some θ' phase precipitated because of the thermal cycling during the WAAM forming process. Then, the supersaturation of copper in the α-Al matrix was reduced. The influence of solution temperature on the precipitation behavior of the θ″ phase and the microstructure evolution were investigated in detail. The experimental and calculative results demonstrate that the precipitation strengthening of the θ″ phase improves with the increasing solution temperature, and the strengthening contribution of θ″ phase is 202.1 MPa, 165.2 MPa, and 150.3 MPa corresponding to the solution temperature at 540 °C, 530 °C, and 520 °C, respectively. The average ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, elongation, and micro-hardness of the WAAM processed samples were obtained after T6 treatment with 540 °C, 45 min/Water quenching +180 °C, 6 h/Water quenching, which is 397 ± 4 MPa, 303 ± 5 MPa, 5.3 ± 1%, and 139 ± 6 HV respectively. Compared to the casting + T6 treated 2219 Al alloy, the samples in this research present a similar tensile strength and slightly lower ductility. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","2219 Al alloy; Mechanical property; Precipitation strengthening; Solution treatment; Wire + arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Microhardness; Precipitation (chemical); Quenching; Tensile strength; 2219 aluminum alloys; Increasing solutions; Micro-structure evolutions; Precipitation behavior; Precipitation strengthening; Solution temperature; T6 treatment; Ultimate tensile strength; Aluminum alloys","","","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFB1106302); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This paper was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Project No. 2018YFB1106302 ).","Zhang Y., Li R., Chen P., Li X., Liu Z., Et al., Microstructural evolution of Al2Cu phase and mechanical properties of the large-scale Al alloy components under different consecutive manufacturing processes, J.

Design/methodology/approach: Specimens with two layer thicknesses (14 and 28 µm) were printed in two aspect ratios (2:1) and (10:1), four thickness values (1, 2, 3 and 4 mm) and three build orientations (45d, XY and YX) and scanned with a wide-area 3D surface scanner to quantify distortion. The material used to build the test specimens was a commercially available resin, VeroWhitePlus RGD835. Findings: The results of this study showed that all printed specimens by material jetting 3D printers had some level of distortion. The 1-mm thickness specimens, for both layer thicknesses of 14 µm and 28 µm, showed a wide range of anomalies including reverse coil set (RCS), reverse cross bow (RCB), cross bow (CB), wavy edge (WE) and some moderate twisting (T). Similar occurrences were observed for the 2-mm thickness specimens as there were RCS, WE, RCB and T anomalies that show the difference between the thinner specimens (1- and 2-mm) with the thicker ones (3- and 4-mm). In both 3- and 4-mm thickness specimens, there was more consistency in terms of distortion with mainly RCS and RCB anomalies. In total, six different types of flatness anomalies were found to occur with the following incidences: reverse coil set (91 specimens, 63.19%), reverse cross bow (50 specimens, 34.72%), wavy edge (23 specimens, 15.97%), twist (19 specimens, 12.50%), coil set (11 specimens, 7.64%) and cross bow (7 specimens, 4.86%). Originality/value: This study expands the research on how the preprocess parameters such as layer thickness and build orientation and the geometrical parameters such as part thickness and aspect ratio cause dimensional distortion. Distortion is a pervasive consequence of the curing process in photopolymerization and explores one of the most common defects that come across in polymeric-based additive manufacturing. In addition to the characterization of the type and magnitude of distortion, the contributions of this work also include establishing the foundation for design guidelines aiming at minimizing distortion in material jetting. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Design guidelines; Distortion; Material jetting; Residual stresses; Warpage","Aspect ratio; Design; Geometry; Photopolymerization; Build orientation; Curing process; Design/methodology/approach; Jetting technology; Layer thickness; Minimizing distortions; Test specimens; Thickness value; 3D printers","","","","","","","Aslani K., Vakouftsi F., Kechagias J.D., Mastorakis N.E., Surface roughness optimization of Poly-Jet 3D printing using grey taguchi method, 2019 International Conference on Control, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics Optimization (ICCAIRO).

It increases the computing power consumption of the cloud's systems. Consolidation of cloud's Virtual Machines (VMs) provides a pragmatic approach to reduce the energy consumption of cloud Data Centers (DC). Effective VM consolidation and VM migration without breaching Service Level Agreement (SLA) can be attained by taking proactive decisions based on cloud's future workload prediction. Effective task scheduling, another major issue of cloud computing also relies on accurate forecasting of resource usage. Cloud workload traces exhibit both periodic and non-periodic patterns with the sudden peak of load. As a result, it is very challenging for the prediction models to precisely forecast future workload. This prompted us to propose a hybrid Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based prediction model named BHyPreC. BHyPreC architecture includes Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) on top of the stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Here, BHyPreC is used to predict future CPU usage workload of cloud's VM. Our proposed model enhances the non-linear data analysis capability of Bi-LSTM, LSTM, and GRU models separately and demonstrates better accuracy compared to other statistical models. The effect of variation of historical window size and training-testing data size on these models is observed. The experimental result shows that our model gives higher accuracy and performs better in comparison to Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), LSTM, GRU, and Bi-LSTM model for both short-term ahead and long-term ahead prediction.  © 2013 IEEE.","Cloud computing; deep learning; recurrent neural network; time series analysis; virtual machine; workload prediction","Autoregressive moving average model; Brain; Cloud computing; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Green computing; Network security; Predictive analytics; Virtual machine; Analysis capabilities; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Cloud computing technologies; Cloud data centers; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Recurrent neural network model; Service Level Agreements; Workload predictions; Long short-term memory","","","","","","","Mell P.M., Grance T., The NIST definition of cloud computing, Nat.

To explain the formation of the deposited microstructure, the process of laser-powder interaction and particle transport phenomena during laser direct deposition were investigated through experiment and simulation works. The parameters of the coaxial powder flow (the distribution and the velocity of flying particles) and the particle motion on the melt pool were demonstrated with high-speed imaging. By using these parameters, a laser-powder flow interaction model was established to calculate the laser intensity attenuated by the powder flow and the temperatures of W and Cu particles. Based on the calculated results, a three-phase fluid dynamics model was constructed to simulate the transport phenomena of W and Cu particles on the substrate surface during laser deposition. The calculated results indicate that the temperatures of W and Cu particles were mainly in the solid state but with huge difference in temperature while arriving at the deposition area. The captured images show that these solid particles can be deposited until the substrate surface was slightly melted. The simulation results suggest that the heat of W particles is conducted to Cu particles rapidly after being deposited on the substrate surface. Coupled with the laser irradiation, Cu particles are melted and form a melt pool. Subsequently, a fallen W particle can float on the melt pool since the inertial force of the falling W particle and the surface tension between Cu and W are roughly balanced. In comparison, if a Cu particle falls on a floating W particle, the Cu particle will be melted and then flow into the melt pool in 300 μs. The combination of high-speed imaging and our simulation explained the deposited microstructure, i.e., the distribution of W particles in the deposition layer. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","High-speed imaging; Laser direct deposition; Numerical modeling; WCu composite","3D printers; Deposition; High speed cameras; Lakes; Microstructure; Particle separators; Additive manufacturing technology; High speed imaging; Interaction model; Laser depositions; Laser direct depositions; Particle transport; Substrate surface; Transport phenomena; Transport properties","","","","","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (30919011255, 30919011412); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, PAPD","This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( 30919011412 and 30919011255 ).

In this paper, we propose Deep learning based Service Impact Prediction system (DeepSIP), which predicts the service impact of network failure in a network element using a temporal multimodal convolutional neural network (CNN). More precisely, DeepSIP predicts the time to recovery from the failure and the loss of traffic volume due to the failure in a network on the basis of information from syslog messages and traffic volume. Since the time to recovery is useful information for a service level agreement (SLA) and the loss of traffic volume is directly related to the severity of the failure, we regard the time to recovery and the loss of traffic volume as the service impact. The service impact is challenging to predict, since it depends on types of network failures and traffic volume when the failure occurs. Moreover, network elements do not explicitly contain any information about the service impact. To extract the type of network failures and predict the service impact, we use syslog messages and past traffic volume. However, syslog messages and traffic volume are also challenging to analyze because these data are multimodal, are strongly correlated, and have temporal dependencies. To extract useful features for prediction, we develop a temporal multimodal CNN.We experimentally evaluated DeepSIP in terms of accuracy by comparing it with other NN-based methods by using synthetic and real datasets. For both datasets, the results show that DeepSIP outperformed the baselines.  © 2021 The Institute of Electronics.","CNN; Multimodal; Network operation; Service impact","Computer system recovery; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Forecasting; Convolutional neural network; Impacts prediction systems; Multi-modal; Network element; Network failure; Network operations; Service impact; Switch routers; Syslog messages; Traffic volumes; Recovery","","","","","","","Matsuo Y., Kimura T., Nishimatsu K., DeepSIP: A system for predicting service impact of network failure by temporal multimodal CNN, AnNet, pp. 1-6, (2020); Phillipa G., Navendu J., Nachiappan andN., Understanding network failures in data centers: Measurement, analysis, and implications, ACM SIGCOMM Comput.

The arrangement of the springs and damper is similar to setup for the Standard Linear Solid (SLS) model used to model a viscoelastic material. One linear spring is in series with the damper and another nonlinear spring is parallel with the damper. The nonlinear structural system is governed by the following three parameters: (a) the ratio of the linear spring constants (R), (b) damping ratio (ζ), and (c) nonlinearity strength (λ). The focus of the present study is to examine the response of the cylinder to VIV by changing ζ and λ. The peak amplitude decreases in comparison with a linear spring, as spring softening (λ<0) is increased; in contrast, the peak amplitude increases for a hardening spring (λ>0). The equivalent reduced velocity (Ureq), a measure of nonlinearity, is affected by damping, showing the non-monotonic variation with ζ. There exists a critical value ζ≈1 below which the equivalent reduced velocity decreases and beyond which Ureq increases. We also observed at high values of λ (e.g. λ=4), the peak lift force coefficient is almost constant over a wide range of reduced velocity, with the absence of the lower branch for a very low (ζ=0.001) and high (ζ=10) values of damping. This near constant amplitude range suggests a hardening spring may be useful for extending the operational range for energy extraction applications. Finally, increased system nonlinearity leads to considerably richer spectral content in the displacement and force signals, reflected in the wake development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cubic stiffness nonlinearity; Damping; Viscoelasticity; Vortex-induced vibration","Circular cylinders; Damping; Fluid structure interaction; Hardening; Vibrations (mechanical); Viscoelasticity; Vortex flow; Lift force coefficients; Measure of nonlinearities; Non-monotonic variation; Nonlinear visco-elastic; Standard linear solid models; Structural non-linearities; Visco-elastic material; Vortex induced vibration; Springs (components)","","","","","","","Amabili M., Nonlinear damping in large-amplitude vibrations: modelling and experiments, Nonlinear Dynam., 93, 1, pp. 5-18, (2018); Amabili M., Derivation of nonlinear damping from viscoelasticity in case of nonlinear vibrations, Nonlinear Dynam., 97, 3, pp. 1785-1797, (2019); Badhurshah R., Bhardwaj R., Bhattacharya A., Lock-in regimes for vortex-induced vibrations of a cylinder attached to a bistable spring, J.

However, the mechanisms of the reduction in residual stress and distortion during multi-layer rolling are not well understood. Conventional finite element models for rolling are highly inefficient, hindering the simulation of multi-layer rolling for large WAAM components. This study aims to identify the most suitable modelling technique for finite element analysis of large WAAM component rolling. Four efficient rolling models were developed, and their efficiency and accuracy were compared with reference to a conventional large-scale rolling model (i.e., control model) for a WAAM built wall. A short-length transient model with fewer elements than the control model was developed to reduce computational time. Accurate predictions of stress and strain and a reduction in computational time by 96.5% were achieved using the short-length model when an implicit method for numerical solution was employed, while similar efficiency but less accurate prediction was obtained when an explicit solution method was adopted. A Eulerian steady-state model was also developed, which was slightly less efficient (95.91% reduction in computational time) but was much less accurate due to unrealistic representation of rolling process. The applicability of a 2D rolling model was also examined and it was found that the 2D model is highly efficient (99.52% time reduction) but less predictive due to the 2D simplification. This study also shows that the rigid roller adopted in the models is beneficial for improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. © 2021 by the authors.

The combinations of OFDM and 'multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO') offer high quality of services and better throughput. The multicarrier OFDM system experiences a high 'peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR'), which is the major issue in the OFDM scheme and must be truncated to achieve trustworthy communication. Due to high PAPR in a signal to be transmitted, the power amplifier in the transmitter section enters into saturation region and amplifies the signal nonlinearly, resulting in loss of orthogonality and ultimately in 'inter-carrier interference (ICI)'. In this article, the 'iterative clipping and filtering (ICF)' method is proposed to minimize the PAPR in the OFDM system. The simulation is carried out using MATLAB (version 2014b). The result of the proposed ICF method and the 'selective mapping (SLM)' scheme is analyzed and compared. From the analysis, it is shown that the proposed ICF technique is more suitable for minimizing the PAPR effectively without affecting 'bit error rates (BER)' much and the simplicity of the system. The simulation result of the proposed ICF scheme using 'Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK)', FFT size of 128, and clipping and filtering level up to 6 shows that the proposed ICF scheme for clipping level of 6 reduces PAPR to 5dB. Also, the BER is minimized at the level of 3×10-5at 12 dB SNR. © 2021 University of Kuwait.

After artificial aging treatment, the precipitate strengthening makes the greatest contribution to the strength. At a lower aging temperature (426 K), nano-sized precipitates including AlxCuyMnz result in a limited sacrifice of the plasticity but a significant improvement in strength in the early stage. As the aging duration increases, θ'' and θ' precipitates nucleate, which can strongly improve the strength. Samples aged for 48 h have the highest ultimate tensile strength (473 MPa) due to the presence of θ' with high aspect ratio and dispersed θ''. At a higher aging temperature (446 K), The mixed θ'' and θ' layer structured precipitates contribute to the mechanical properties of the samples aged for 6 h and 10 h. The precipitate growth and the θ'' to θ' transformation both significantly affect the strength and ductility trade-off. Because the interfacial energy of θ'' is smaller than that of θ', the coarsening rate of θ'' is slower. As a result, the in-situ transformed θ' is smaller compared with the θ' nucleating at the defects, which is beneficial for the strength increase. The loss of Cd during SLM is one of the main reasons for the inapplicability of the traditional aging methods. The results highlight the importance of controlling the precipitates through post-aging process. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aluminum alloys; Heat treatment; Mechanical properties; Precipitates; Selective laser melting","Aluminum alloys; Aspect ratio; Binary alloys; Coarsening; Economic and social effects; Manganese alloys; Selective laser melting; Tensile strength; Ternary alloys; Aging temperatures; Artificial aging treatments; Nano-sized precipitates; Precipitate growth; Precipitate strengthening; Strength and ductilities; Strength increase; Ultimate tensile strength; Copper alloys","","","","","Analytical and Testing Center of HUST; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51805184); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51805184 ).

However, no solution has been presented for elastic–viscoplastic (EVP) soil until now. This paper presents a general solution method for solving the classical one-dimensional (1D) boundary value problem (BVP) for undrained cylindrical or spherical cavity expansion in EVP soil with an emphasis on the rate effect of soil. The solution method is summarized as three standard procedures: (i) obtaining the soil displacement and strain under incompressible conditions, (ii) calculating the effective stress of soil through a suitable constitutive law, and (iii) obtaining the pore pressure by numerically solving the stress equilibrium equation through the finite difference method (FDM) or other numerical solution techniques. The numerical algorithms for calculating the effective stress and pore pressure are very simple, without any complex iteration processes, and they require little calculation time but provide high computational accuracy. In addition, some numerical results are given to investigate the influence of the cavity expansion velocity on the cavity expansion response. The proposed solution procedure is general and can be applied not only for the EVP model but also for other plasticity models, and the given EVP solution can be applied to interpret the rate effect of the cone penetration test and pile penetration. © 2021, Canadian Science Publishing.

In many of these practical situations, the structures suffer from drop-impact loads. Materials and structures significantly change their behavior when submitted to impact loading conditions compared to quasi-static loading. The present work is devoted to investigating the thermal process in carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP) subjected to a drop test. A novel drop-weight impact test experiment is performed to evaluate parameters specific to 3D composite materials. A strain gauge rosette and infrared thermography are employed to record the kinematic and thermal fields on the composites’ surfaces. This technique is nondestructive and offers an extensive full-field investigation of a material’s response. The combination of strain and infrared thermography data allows a comprehensive analysis of thermoelastic effects in CFRP when subjected to impacts. The experimental results are validated using numerical analysis by developing a MATLAB® code to analyze whether the coupled heat and wave equation phenomenon exists in a two-dimensional polar coordinate system by discretizing through a forward-time central-space (FTCS) finite-difference method (FDM). The results show the coupling has no significant impact as the waves generated due to impact disappears in 0.015 s. In contrast, heat diffusion happens for over a one-second period. This study demonstrates that the heat equation alone governs the CFRP heat flow process, and the thermoelastic effect is negligible for the specific drop-weight impact load. © 2020 by the authors.

Especially in ophthalmology, it is impossible to use real human/non-human primate eyes for ophthalmology surgery practice. However, surgical practice is most important for ophthalmologist. The retina laser surgery is one of the ophthalmology surgeries and it requires more surgical practice for surgeons to use the laser beam precisely to coagulate and fuse small areas of tissue. Dealing with the prospect of vision reduction or vision loss presents a peculiar problem and that can be highly stressful and frustrating for both doctors and patients. In this regard, training for indirect ophthalmoscopy and retinal photocoagulation is undergone using model eyes instead of real eyes. Properties and functioning of an existing model eye are huge and they differ from real human eye such as casings are completely rigid and focusing of retinal fundus is not completely covered. Therefore, this research concentrates to develop a model eye that assimilates close to the human eye by focussing on the maximum viewing area that is not done at the moment. Finally, the design and development of re-engineered model eye for retina laser is fabricated by additive manufacturing. Compared to existing plastic model eye, viewing area and viewing angle of the re-engineered model eye is increased by 16.66% and 6.14%, respectively. Due to design modifications and elimination of the insert, it can be reduced by 18.99% and 13.95% of height and weight of the top casing respectively. Developed re-engineered model eye will improve the surgical and diagnostic skill of the surgeon and increase their confidence and proficiency. It also augments the effective use of essential ophthalmic instruments. Additionally, it can reduce the surgical error and meet the existing demand of actual eyes for surgical practices. © IMechE 2020.","additive manufacturing; indirect ophthalmoscopy; reti eye; retinal photocoagulation; Simulation","Animals; Humans; Lasers; Light; Ophthalmology; Retina; 3D printers; Additives; Diagnosis; Laser beams; Laser surgery; Ophthalmology; Design and Development; Design modifications; Diagnostic skills; Ophthalmic instruments; Plastic models; Surgical simulation; Viewing angle; Viewing area; animal; human; laser; light; ophthalmology; retina; surgery; Transplantation (surgical)","","","","","Centre of Excellence in Manufacturing Sciences; Ministry of Human Resource Development, MHRD","We would like to acknowledge, with great gratitude, the Centre of Excellence in Manufacturing Sciences (sponsored by Ministry of Human Resource Development) at Coimbatore Institute of Technology, Coimbatore, India the source where this research was conducted.

If the desired attitude trajectory cannot be tracked precisely, it may cause mission failures. In the real space mission environment, the unknown external perturbations, for example, atmospheric drag and solar radiation, should be taken into consideration. Such external perturbations could deviate the precision of the spacecraft orientation and thereby lead to a mission failure. Therefore, in this paper, a quaternion-based super-twisting sliding mode robust control law for the spacecraft attitude tracking is developed. The finite time stability based on the formulation of the linear matrix inequality (LMI) is also provided. To avoid losing the control degree of freedom due to the certain actuator fault, a redundant reaction wheels configuration is adopted. The actuators distribution associated force distribution matrix (FDM) is analyzed in detail. Finally, the reference tangent-normal-binormal (TNB) command generation strategy is implemented for simulating the scenario of the space mission. Finally, the simulation results reveal that the spacecraft can achieve the desired attitude trajectory tracking demands in the presence of the time-varying external disturbances. © 2021 Yang-Rui Li and Chao-Chung Peng.","","Actuators;

For two-tier virtualized data centers in which containers are deployed on VMs, this paper conducts an in-depth study of this problem from the aspect of resource management. First, the working model of two-tier virtualized data center is defined. By mapping tasks to containers and using VMs to isolate different jobs, this model improves the resource utilization of hosts while ensuring the isolation and security of jobs. Then, an energy-aware host resource management framework is constructed, which includes two algorithms. The initial static placement is a two-tier scheduling algorithm, including the load balancing alternate placement and the two-sided matching methods to complete the placement of containers to VMs and VMs to hosts respectively. The runtime dynamic consolidation algorithm takes the initial placement scheme as input, and utilizes the dynamic consolidation method to use the least active hosts to meet the real-time resource requirements of containers. Finally, simulation experiments compared with related algorithms are conducted using real workload traces. The results show that the proposed two algorithms have better performance in host resource utilization, number of active hosts, number of container migrations and SLA metric. And the entire framework achieves an energy-saving effect of 13.8% at least. © 2013 IEEE.","Cloud data center; container; energy consumption; resource management; virtual machine","Containers; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Green computing; Natural resources management; Power management; Resource allocation; Dynamic consolidation; Dynamic consolidation method; Energy-saving effect; High energy consumption; Resource management framework; Resource requirements; Resource utilizations; Virtualized data centers; Information management","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61772112); Dalian Science and Technology Innovation Fund, (2018J11CY010)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China Grants (NSFC) under Grant 61772112, and in part by the Innovation Foundation of Science and Technology of Dalian under Grant 2018J11CY010.","Jiye W., Biyu Z., Fa Z., Xiang S., Nan Z., Zhiyong L., Data center energy consumption models and energy efficient algorithms, J.

In extrusion-based bioprinters, stable formation of filaments and high-fidelity deposition of bioinks are the primary challenges in fabrication of physiologically relevant tissue constructs. Among various bioinks, gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) is known as a photocurable and physicochemically tunable hydrogel with a demonstrated biocompatibility and tunable biodegradation properties. The two-step crosslinking of GelMA (reversible thermal gelation and permanent photo-crosslinking) has attracted researchers to make complex tissue constructs. Despite promising results in filament formation and printability of this hydrogel, the effect of temperature on physicochemical properties, cytocompatibility, and biodegradation of the hydrogel are to be investigated. This work studies the effect of thermoreversible, physical crosslinking on printability of GelMA. The results of 3D printing of GelMA at different temperatures followed by irreversible chemical photo-crosslinking show that the decrease in temperature improves the filament formation and shape fidelity of the deposited hydrogel, particularly at the temperatures around 15 °C. Time dependant mechanical testing of the printed samples revealed that decreasing the extruding temperature increases the elastic properties of the extruded filaments. Furthermore, our novel approach in minimizing the slippage effect during rheological study enabled to measure changes in linear and non-linear viscoelastic properties of the printed samples at different temperatures. A considerable increase in storage modulus of the extruded samples printed at lower temperatures confirms their higher solid behavior. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a remarkable decrease in porosity of the extruded hydrogels by decreasing the temperature. Chemical analysis by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and circular dichroism showed a direct relationship between the coil-helix transition in hydrogel macromers and its physical alterations. Finally, biodegradation and cytocompatibility of the extruded hydrogels decreased at lower extruding temperatures.  © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Biomechanical Phenomena; Bioprinting; Cell Survival; Cells, Cultured; Computer Simulation; Cross-Linking Reagents; Gelatin; Humans; Hydrogels; Ink; Materials Testing; Methacrylates; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Rheology; Temperature; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; 3D printers; Biocompatibility; Biodegradation; Chemical analysis; Circular dichroism spectroscopy; Crosslinking; Diagnosis; Dichroism; Gelation; Hydrogels; Image enhancement; Mechanical testing; Physicochemical properties; Scanning electron microscopy; Tissue; Viscoelasticity; gelatin; gelatin methacryloyl bioink; hydrogel; ink; methacrylic acid; unclassified drug; cross linking reagent; gelatin; gelatin methacryloyl; ink; methacrylic acid; Cytocompatibility; Extruding temperature; Filament formation; Linking strategy; Photo-cross-linkings; Printed samples; Step cross-linking; Tissue constructs; Tissue engineering applications; Tunables; Article; biodegradation; cell viability; circular dichroism; compression; computer model; contact angle; cross linking; elasticity; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; freeze drying; human; human cell; human tissue; hydrophobicity; nervous tissue; optical profilometry; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; room temperature; scanning electron microscopy; skin fibroblast; surface area; surface tension; thin filament; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; ultraviolet radiation; viscoelasticity; Young modulus; biomechanics; bioprinting; cell culture; cell survival; chemistry; computer simulation; devices; flow kinetics; hydrogel; materials testing; procedures; temperature; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy","","gelatin, 9000-70-8; methacrylic acid, 18358-13-9, 79-41-4; Cross-Linking Reagents, ; Gelatin, ; gelatin methacryloyl, ; Hydrogels, ; Methacrylates, ","","","","","Bishop E S, Mostafa S, Pakvasa M, Luu H H, Lee M J, Wolf J M, Ameer G A, He T-C, Reid R R, 3-D bioprinting technologies in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine: current and future trends, Genes Dis, 4, pp. 185-195, (2017); Trivedi M, Et al., Additive manufacturing of pharmaceuticals for precision medicine applications: A review of the promises and perils in implementation, Addit.

A multiple plane-jet flame (2D) has been considered, which is operated with premixed methane/air mixtures at atmospheric conditions and with different equivalence ratios. Free flame (FF) and side-wall quenching (SWQ) conditions have been accomplished by defining one lateral boundary as either a symmetry plane for FF or a cold wall with fixed temperature for SWQ. An equidistant grid with a resolution of 20 µm is used to resolve the FWI zone. The GRI-3.0 mechanism is used for computing chemical reaction rates. The flame is tangentially compressed when approaching the cold wall, and elongated in the FF case, causing an inversion of the sign of the tangential strain rate Kas and a considerable decrease of the total stretch rate Katot for the SWQ flame. The flame consumption speed SL decreases with decreasing normal stretch due to curvature Kac while approaching the cold wall, but it increases with decreasing Kac for the FF case, leading to an inversion of the Markstein number Matot based on Katot from positive in FF to negative in the SWQ case. The results reveal a strong correlation of flame dynamics during transitions from FWI to freely propagating flames, which may bring a new perspective for modeling FWI phenomena by means of flame dynamics. To do this, the quenching effect of the wall may be reproduced by an inversion of the Markstein number from positive to negative in the FWI zone and applying the general linear Markstein correlation, leading to a decrease of the flame consumption speed. In addition, the quenching distance evaluated from SL has been found to be almost equal to the unstretched laminar flame thickness, which compares quantitatively well with measured data from literature. © 2020 The Combustion Institute","Direct numerical simulation; Flame Dynamics; Flame wall interaction; OpenFOAM; Side wall quenching","Dynamics; Quenching; Reaction rates; Atmospheric conditions; Equivalence ratios; Flame-wall interaction; Laminar premixed flames; Molecular transport; Quenching distance; Strong correlation; Tangential strain rates; Strain rate","","","","","Helmholtz Association of German Research Centers; Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft, HGF, (34.14.02); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (237267381 TRR 150)","This work is supported by the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centers ( HGF ), within the research field Energy, Material and Resources, Topic 4 Gasification ( 34.14.02 ), and the German Research Foundation (DFG), grant number 237267381 TRR 150.","Poinsot T., Veynante D., Theoretical and numerical combustion, (2005); Dreizler A., Bohm B., P COMBUST INST, 35, 1, pp. 37-64, (2015); Jainski C., Rissmann M., Bohm B., Janicka J., Dreizler A., COMBUST FLAME, 183, pp. 271-282, (2017); Heinrich A., Ganter S., Kuenne G., Jainski C., Dreizler A., Janicka J., FLOW TURBUL COMBUST, 100, 2, pp. 535-559, (2018); Ganter S., Heinrich A., Meier T., Kuenne G., Jainski C., Rissmann M.C., Dreizler A., Janicka J., COMBUST FLAME, 186, pp. 299-310, (2017); Haber T., Suntz R., INT J HEAT FLUID FL, 69, pp. 95-105, (2018); Strassacker C., Bykov V., Maas U., INT J HEAT FLUID FL, 69, pp. 185-193, (2018); Mejia D., Selle L., Bazile R., Poinsot T., P COMBUST INST, 35, 3, pp. 3201-3208, (2015); Kosaka H., Zentgraf F., Scholtissek A., Bischoff L., Haber T., Suntz R., Albert B., Hasse C., Dreizler A., INT J HEAT FLUID FL, 70, pp. 181-192, (2018); Poinsot T., Haworth D.C., Bruneaux G., COMBUST FLAME, 95, 1-2, pp. 118-132, (1993); Popp P., Baum M., COMBUST FLAME, 108, 3, pp. 327-348, (1997); Frank G., Zips J., Pfitzner M., Sonderforschungsbereich/Transregio 40 Annual Report, (2014); Proch F., Kempf A., P COMBUST INST, 35, 3, pp. 3337-3345, (2015); Strassacker C., Bykov V., Maas U., COMBUST SCI TECHNOL, 191, 2, pp. 208-222, (2019); Lieuwen T.C., Unsteady combustor physics, (2012); Zhang F., Zirwes T., Habisreuther P., Bockhorn H., COMBUST FLAME, 175, pp. 170-179, (2017); Bradley D., Gaskell P., Gu X., COMBUST FLAME, 104, 1-2, pp. 176-198, (1996); Karpov V.P., Lipatnikov A.N., Wolanski P., COMBUST FLAME, 109, 3, pp. 436-448, (1997); Tahtouh T., Halter F., Mounaim-Rousselle C., COMBUST FLAME, 156, 9, pp. 1735-1743, (2009); Halter F., Tahtouh T., Mounaim-Rousselle C., COMBUST FLAME, 157, 10, pp. 1825-1832, (2010); Bonhomme A., Selle L., Poinsot T., COMBUST FLAME, 160, 7, pp. 1208-1214, (2013); Wu F., Liang W., Chen Z., Ju Y., Law C.K., P COMBUST INST, 35, 1, pp. 663-670, (2015); Smith G.P., Golden D., Frenklach M., Moriarty N., Eiteneer B., Goldenberg M., Bowman C., Hanson R., Song S., Gardiner W., Et al., Sandia National Laboratory, (2000); Zirwes T., Zhang F., Habisreuther P., Hansinger M., Bockhorn H., Pfitzner M., Trimis D., FLOW TURBUL COMBUST, (2019); Zhang F., Bonart H., Zirwes T., Habisreuther P., Bockhorn H., Zarzalis N., Direct numerical simulation of chemically reacting flows with the public domain code openfoam, High Performance Computing in Science and Engineering'14, pp. 221-236, (2015); Vo S., Stein O., Kronenburg A., Cleary M., COMBUST FLAME, 179, pp. 280-299, (2017); Zhang F., Baust T., Zirwes T., Denev J., Habisreuther P., Zarzalis N., Bockhorn H., Energy Technol, 5, pp. 1055-1063, (2017); Zirwes T., Zhang F., Haber T., Bockhorn H., COMBUST SCI TECHNOL, 191, 1, pp. 178-195, (2019); Zhang F., Zirwes T., Habisreuther P., Bockhorn H., Trimis D., Nawroth H., Paschereit C.O., COMBUST SCI TECHNOL, pp. 1-21, (2018); Zirwes T., Zhang F., Denev J.A., Habisreuther P., Bockhorn H., Automated code generation for maximizing performance of detailed chemistry calculations in openfoam, High Performance Computing in Science and Engineering'17, pp. 189-204, (2018); Zirwes T., Zhang F., Denev J.A., Habisreuther P., Bockhorn H., Trimis D., Improved vectorization for efficient chemistry computations in openfoam for large scale combustion simulations, High Performance Computing in Science and Engineering'18, pp. 209-224, (2019); Barlow R., Karpetis A., Frank J., Chen J., COMBUST FLAME, 127, 3, pp. 2102-2118, (2001); Foucher F., Burnel S., Mounaim-Rousselle C., Boukhalfa M., Renou B., Trinite M., EXP THERM FLUID SCI, 27, 4, pp. 431-437, (2003)","F.

This has attracted research interest from academia and the industry in the application of industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies in the O&G sector. The application of some of these I4.0 technologies has been presented in the literature, but the domain still lacks a comprehensive survey of the application of I4.0 in the O&G upstream sector. This paper investigates the state-of-the-art efforts directed toward I4.0 technologies in the O&G upstream sector. To achieve this, first, an overview of the I4.0 is discussed followed by a systematic literature review from an integrative perspective for publications between 2012-2021 with 223 analyzed documents. The benefits and challenges of the adoption of I4.0 have been identified. Moreover, the paper adds value by proposing a framework for the implementation of I4.0 in the O&G upstream sector. Finally, future directions and research opportunities such as framework, edge computing, quantum computing, communication technologies, standardization, and innovative areas related to the implementation of I4.0 in the upstream sector are presented. The findings from this review show that I4.0 technologies are currently being explored and deployed for various aspects of the upstream sector. However, some of the I4.0 technologies like additive manufacturing and virtual reality are least explored. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

However, they are the extra materials that must be removed afterwards. When the supports have many contacts to the model or are even enclosed inside some concavities, removing them is very challenging and has a risk of damaging the part. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop a new type of tree-support, named Escaping Tree-Support (ET-Sup), which tries to build all the supports onto the build plate to minimize the number of contact points. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology is to first classify the support points into three categories: clear, obstructed and enclosed. A clear point has nothing between it and the build plate; an obstructed point is not clear, but there exists a path for it to reach the build plate; and an enclosed point has no way to reach the build plate. With this classification, the path for the obstructed points to come clear can be found through linking them to the clear points. All the operations are performed efficiently with the help of a ray representation. Findings: The method is tested on different overhang features, including a lattice ball and a mushroom shape with a concave cap. All the supports generated for the examples can find their way to the build plate, which looks like they are escaping from the model. The computation time is around one second for these cases. Originality/value: This is the first time truly realizing this “escaping” property in the generation of tree-like support structures. With this ET-Sup, it is expected that the AM industries can reduce the manufacturing lead time and save much labor work in post-processing. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing;

Here we developed two types of pedal switches incorporated with training devices to improve their walking and balance performance of children with cerebral palsy. The first type of pedal switch can be used to operate a home appliance, while the second type of pedal switch can connect them to web games. Pedal switches can be used for home rehabilitation. This randomized controlled trial included patients in the intervention (n = 24) and control (n = 24) groups who completed 15 weeks of ankle training. The experimental group performed ankle dorsiflexion using a pressure-activated pedal switch connected to the web games. The control group performed ankle dorsiflexion exercises using a pedal switch that operated a home appliance (a fan). Standing balance and walking performance were estimated using the Zebris FDM system, a pressure force platform, the Pediatric Balance Scale score, and the 1-minute walk test. The pre- and posttest data were analyzed using analysis of variance and analysis of covariance, which revealed that the intervention group had more significant improvements in sway patterns and balance and walking. The developed facility of a modified pedal switch integrated with web games can achieve better exercise adherence to promote balance and walking performance than that with home appliances. Maintaining motivation in children with cerebral palsy plays a very important role in the rehabilitation process.  © 2001-2011 IEEE.","Ankle rehabilitation; cerebral palsy; postural balance; web games","Ankle; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Exercise Therapy; Humans; Postural Balance; Walking; Diseases; Domestic appliances; Patient treatment; Regression analysis; Analysis of covariances; Balance performance; Children with cerebral palsies; Experimental groups; Pressure force; Randomized controlled trial; Standing balances; Training devices; adolescent; Article; Berg Balance Scale; body equilibrium; cerebral palsy; child; clinical article; controlled study; female; flexor reflex; functional status assessment; Gross Motor Function Classification System; hemiplegia; home rehabilitation; human; joint function; male; muscle training; online game; outcome assessment; Pediatric Balance Scale; preschool child; pretest posttest design; quadriplegia; randomized controlled trial; school child; training; walk test; walking; walking speed; ankle; cerebral palsy; kinesiotherapy; Patient rehabilitation","","","","","","","Tyson S., Connell L., The psychometric properties and clinical utility of measures of walking and mobility in neurological conditions: A systematic review, Clin.

An investigation of the evolution of top coal drawing characteristics and revealing the evolution of top coal drawing parameters is necessary when providing guidance for caving parameter selection and improving the top coal recovery ratio. Based on in-situ measurements of the size distribution of caved top coal blocks in Wangjialing coal mine, a finite difference method (FDM)–discrete element method (DEM) coupled method was applied to establish a “continuous–discontinuous” numerical model and the process from the first coal drawing to the common coal drawing was simulated with 17 separate working face advances. The evolution of the drawing body (DB), loose body (LB), and top coal boundary (TCB) was obtained. The results show that, the evolution of parameters of DB such as shape and size, drawing amount, length and deflection angle of the long axis of the profile ellipsoid tended to decrease first, then increase, decrease again, and finally stabilise; the increment of the LB advance coal wall distance and the coal pillar distance was close to 0 m in the common coal drawing stage, while width increment of the LB was close to the drawing interval (0.865 m). The TCB formed after each coal drawing round was fitted based on the improved “Hook” function. The evolution of height and radius of curvature of TCB’s stagnation point was analysed. This was divided into three stages: the first (first to third drawing rounds) was the initial mining influence stage, the second (fourth to ninth drawing rounds) was the transitional caving stage, and the third (after tenth drawing round) was the common coal drawing stage. © 2021 by the authors.

Using wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) technology the high-entropy alloy (HEA) AlCoCrFeNi of nonequiatomic composition has been produced (wt. %: 15.64 Al; 7.78 Co; 8.87 Cr; 22.31 Fe; 44.57 Ni). It is shown by methods of modern material science that the HEA is a polycrystalline material with a grain size 4–15 μm along whose grain boundaries the second-phase particles are detected. It is shown by the mapping methods that bulks of grains are enriched in aluminium and nickel while grain boundaries contain chromium and iron. Cobalt is quasi-uniformly distributed in crystal lattice of the manufactured HEA. The material ultimate strength in testing for compression depends on production mode and varies within the interval from 1300 to 1800 MPa. The HEA wear parameter amounts to 1.4∙10−4 mm3/N∙m, friction coefficient — 0.65. In testings for tension the material failure occurred by the mechanism of intragrain cleavage. The formation of brittle cracks along boundaries and in grain boundary junctions i.e. in sites containing the inclusions of second phases is revealed. One of the reasons of HEA increased brittleness is the revealed nonuniform distribution of elements in alloy structure. The HEA’s irradiation by pulsed electron beam with energy density of 10–30 J/cm2 (pulse duration 200 μs, number of pulses 3) results in material homogenization. High-velocity crystallization of molten surface layer of HEA samples is accompanied by the formation of columnar structure having a submicro-nanocrystalline structure. The HEA irradiation results in the increase in hardness and plasticity of the material. The largest increase (1.6 times) in ultimate strength is obtained in the alloy after electron beam processing with energy density of 30 J/cm2. Electron beam processing leads to decrease in microhardness of alloy surface layer up to 90 μm thick. © Gromov V. E., Ivanov Yu. F., Konovalov S. V., Osintsev K.

Although conventional lean-premixed gas turbine combustion systems have evolved in accordance with NOx emission regulations, it faced important challenges, including flashback of ultrafast high-hydrogen flames, shear layer instability-induced pressure fluctuations, and increased residence time due to the formation of large recirculating flows. This led to considerable interest in alternative nozzle architectures such as a micromixer-type nozzle assembly, with injector elements fabricated by additive manufacturing. The response of the prototypical micromixer-type injector was studied in comparison with the behavior of conventional large-scale swirl-stabilized flames. Results showed that the development of self-excited instabilities in unconventional mesoscale flames is fundamentally different from that in large-scale swirl flames, in terms of the onset of instabilities, nonlinear modal dynamics, and amplitude/frequency of limit cycle oscillations under the same operating conditions. These differences are due to the alteration in local flow/flame structures and the resulting flame-to-flame/flame-wall interaction mechanisms. An integrated analysis of large datasets revealed that the two interacting swirl-stabilized flames tend to couple strongly with a low-frequency L1 mode at about 220 Hz, whereas the sixty-injector small-scale flames are capable of triggering multiple higher-frequency instabilities at ∼310, ∼470, and ∼600 Hz. That is, the use of the micromixer-type injector assembly in a lean-premixed system led to shifting of combustion instabilities toward a higher equivalence ratio. However, due to the absence of a large recirculation zone near the primary reaction region, the combustion system equipped with the small-scale multinozzle injectors suffered from lean blowoff phenomena at low equivalence ratio.","Gas turbine combustion; Lean-premixed; Multinozzle array; Self-excited instabilities; Swirl-stabilized","Gas turbines; Gas-turbine combustion; Large-scales; Lean premixed; Meso scale; Multinozzle array; Self - excited; Self-excited instability; Swirl-stabilized; Combustion","","","","","National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; MSIT, (2019R1A2C1003208)","This work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2019R1A2C1003208).","Beer J.M., Prog Energy Combust Sci, 26, 4-6, pp. 301-327, (2000); Kinnon M.A.M., Brouwer J., Samuelsen S., Prog Energy Combust Sci, 64, 1, pp. 62-92, (2018); Kobayashi H., Hayakawa A., Kunkuma K.D., Somarathne A., Okafor E.C., Proc Combust Inst, 37, 1, pp. 109-133, (2019); York W.D., Ziminsky W.S., Yilmaz E., J Eng Gas Turb Power, 135, 2, (2013); Asai T., Dodo S., Karishuku M., Yagi N., Akiyama Y., Hayashi A., J Eng Gas Turb Power, 137, 9, (2015); Shanbhogue S.J., Husain S., Lieuwen T., Prog Energy Combust Sci, 35, 1, pp. 98-120, (2009); Gicquel L.Y.M., Staffelbach G., Poinsot T., Prog Energy Combust Sci, 38, 6, pp. 782-817, (2012); O'Connor J., Acharya V., Lieuwen T., Prog Energy Combust Sci, 49, pp. 1-39, (2015); Balachandran R., Ayoola B.O., Kaminski C.F., Dowling A.P., Mastorakos E., Combust Flame, 143, 1-2, pp. 37-55, (2005); Steinberg A.M., Boxx I., Stohr M., Carter C.D., Meier W., Combust Flame, 157, 12, pp. 2250-2266, (2010); Huang Y., Yang V., Prog Energy Combust Sci, 35, 4, pp. 293-364, (2009); Dawson J.R., Worth N.A., Combust Flame, 161, 10, pp. 2565-2578, (2014); Culler W., Chen X., Samarasinghe J., Peluso S., Santavicca D., O'Connor J., Combust Flame, 194, 8, pp. 472-484, (2018); Noiray N., Durox D., Schuller T., Candel S., Combust Flame, 145, 3, pp. 435-446, (2006); Rajasegar R., Choi J., McGann B., Oldani A., Lee T., Hammack S.D., Carter C.D., Yoo J., Combust Flame, 199, 1, pp. 324-337, (2019); Bhagwan R., Schwagerus A., Weis C., Habisreuther P., Zarzalis N., Huth M., Koestlin B., Dedrichs S., ASME Conference Proceedings, (2019); Kim D., Park J., Han D., Kim K.T., Combust Flame, 194, 8, pp. 180-194, (2018); Lee T., Kim K.T., Combus Flame, 218, 8, pp. 234-246, (2020); Lee T., Park J., Han D., Kim K.T., Proc Combust Inst, 37, 4, pp. 5137-5145, (2019); Kang H., Lee T., Jin U., Kim K.T., Proc.

As per the workload requirements of the application's resources should be dynamically allocated for the application. Disparities in resource provisioning produce energy, cost wastages, and additionally, it affects Quality of Service (QoS) and increases Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations. So, applications allocated resources quantity should match with the applications required resources quantity. Load balancing in cloud computing can be addressed through optimal scheduling techniques, whereas this solution belongs to the NP-Complete optimization problem category. However, the cloud providers always face resource management issues for variable cloud workloads in the heterogeneous system environment. This issue has been solved by the proposed Predictive Priority-based Modified Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (PMHEFT) algorithm, which can estimate the application's upcoming resource demands. This research contributes towards developing the prediction-based model for efficient and dynamic resource provisioning in a heterogamous system environment to fulfill the end user's requirements. Existing algorithms fail to meet the user's Quality of Service (QoS) requirements such as makespan minimization and budget constraints satisfaction, or to incorporate cloud computing principles, i.e., elasticity and heterogeneity of computing resources. In this paper, we proposed a PMHEFT algorithm to minimize the makespan of a given workflow application by improving the load balancing across all the virtual machines. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm's makespan, efficiency, and power consumption are better than other algorithms.  © 2013 IEEE.","Cloud computing; load balancing; Predictive Priority-based Modified Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time; Quality of Service; scheduling; Service Level Agreement; virtual machine","Balancing; Budget control; Cloud computing; Energy efficiency; Optimization; Predictive analytics; Dynamic resource provisioning; Heterogeneous systems; Makespan minimization; Optimization problems; Qualityof-service requirement (QoS); Resource management; Service Level Agreements; Workflow applications; Quality of service","","","","","","","Kulkarni A.K., Annappa B., Context aware VM placement optimization technique for heterogeneous IaaS cloud, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 89702-89713, (2019); Liaqat M., Naveed A., Ali R.L., Shuja J., Ko K.-M., Characterizing dynamic load balancing in cloud environments using virtual machine deployment models, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 145767-145776, (2019); Alla H.B., Alla S.B., Touha A., Ezzati A., A novel task scheduling approach based on dynamic queues and hybrid meta-heuristic algorithms for cloud computing environment, Cluster Comput., 21, 4, pp. 1797-1820, (2018); Lin W., Peng G., Bian X., Xu S., Chang V., Li Y., Scheduling algorithms for heterogeneous cloud environment: Main resource load balancing algorithm and time balancing algorithm, J.

This method of using time-driven activity-based costing in collaboration with digital twinning will be advantageous to optimise their use of time and their capacity. Optimising the use of time is essential to ensure efficient process flow and to waste less time and money. To optimise, we need to analyse system dynamics and model system responses, to enable us to consider various scenarios iteratively. This paper first considers activity-based costing, driven by its most precious resource, time. Standard time is defined as the base parameter by which cost is calculated. Charge-out rates of elements are based on the actual cost of equipment apportioned to activities, based on the time spent using such equipment. The process chain is broken into elements, each of which incurs full cost when started. The value chain develops accordingly, enabling us to predict the actual cost of production. Second, the use of digital twinning to model standard time is considered. Stochastic variation is evident, but standard time can be allocated to each element in the process chain, given a certain confidence level. Together, a cause-effect prediction model can be developed. The model would predict the time that a process chain, consisting of known elements, would take. However, in the event of an occurrence out of the norm, the updated expected time can be predicted. Using the same rates, the new cost can be determined immediately. We propose that the digital twin can predict production cost, based on a statistically measurable stochastic variation of element duration and the time-varying charge-out rate. © 2021, South African Institute of Industrial Engineering.

VMP is considered as a multidimensional bin packing problem, which is a type of NP-hard problem. The challenge in VMP is how to optimally place multiple independent virtual machines into a few physical servers to maximize a cloud provider's revenue while meeting the Service Level Agreements (SLAs). In this paper, an effective multiobjective algorithm based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique for the VMP problem, referred to as VMPMOPSO, is proposed. The proposed VMPMOPSO utilizes the crowding entropy method to optimize the VMP and to improve the diversity among the obtained solutions as well as accelerate the convergence speed toward the optimal solution. VMPMOPSO was compared with a simple single-objective algorithm, called First-Fit-Decreasing (FFD), and two multiobjective ant colony and genetic algorithms. Two simulation experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed VMPMOPSO. The first experiment shows that the proposed algorithm has better performance than the algorithms we compared it to in terms of power consumption, SLA violation, and resource wastage. The second indicates that the Pareto optimal solutions obtained by applying VMPMOPSO have a good distribution and a better convergence than the comparative algorithms.  © 2021 E. I.

Its originality lies in the fact that pre-baking is ensured by ohmic heating implemented in a rectangular channel equipped with two parallel electrodes. Experiments and numerical studies were carried out and benchmarked. The rheological properties of the cake batter (non-Newtonian power-law fluid) and the influence of voltage and temperature on electrical conductivity were accommodated in the numerical model. Due to the low velocities of the very viscous products near the solid-liquid interface, it was found that the heterogeneity of the temperature at the nozzle outlet under continuous ohmic heating could lead to nozzle clogging when high temperatures are reached. Hot spots were identified in different areas of the channel, such as corners where the electric field is high and velocity is close to zero. A parametric study was performed on the impact of the thermophysical properties of the batter, showing that specific heat has a much greater impact than thermal conductivity on the accuracy of the temperatures computed. Analysis of the process parameters showed that a stronger electric field leads to a higher temperature gradient in the nozzle section. The temperature gradient decreases with electrode distance (delect) and nozzle width (l). This model could be used to optimize the ohmic heating nozzle configuration, with the objective of obtaining a continuous flow of pre-baked cake batter, while preventing clogging. Such a system could be used as 3D printing head. Industrial relevance: Conventional 3D printing of bakery products is based on the deposition of a batter, followed by a baking. This study proposes an innovative approach based on a printing nozzle equipped with ohmic heating, with the objective of achieving a uniform temperature distribution and of obtaining high mass flow rate. Despite a significant temperature gradient in the baked batter at the exit of the nozzle, the obtained results showed that adjusting the nozzle geometry allows a reduction of the gradient. Further investigations are thus needed to reduce the temperature gradient and to accommodate expansion of the batter in the case of formulation using baking powder. The transfer of such concept for industry application may be doable in a close future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Baking; Cake batter; Continuous Ohmic heating; Electrical conductivity; Modeling; Rheology","Bakeries;

Design/methodology/approach: The finite element separation models of MPSL 3D printing process were established. The established models simulated both tilting and pulling-up separation process by changing the constraints and boundary conditions. The bilinear cohesive curves were used to define the separation interface. The stress distribution of the cured part and FEP film at different times during the whole separation process was extracted. Different orientations of pulling-up and tilting were also compared for stress distribution. The stress change was analyzed for the center and edge points of the upper surface of cured part. Findings: The results showed that the stress increased with the separation speed, and the stress at the edge position of exposure area was greater than the internal position. The tilting traction stress distribution was affected by the exposure area function and the velocity distribution. Alternation of the exposure area function changed the cohesive stiffness. The non-coincidence of the calculated traction stress with the input bilinear cohesive curve reflected the influence of the material properties and the separation methods. The high-speed side of tilting had fast separation and high traction stress. Originality/value: This study proposes a technical method for simulation tilting separation and verified the tilting theory. The cohesive zone model was proved applicable to the tilting traction stress calculation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cohesive zone model; Finite element analysis; Mask projection stereolithography; Tilting separation; Tilting theory verification","Curing; Stereolithography; Stress concentration; 3D printing process; Cohesive zone model; Design/methodology/approach; Separation interface; Separation methods; Separation model; Separation process; Separation simulation; Separation","","","","","Projects of major innovation platforms for scientific and technological and local transformation of scientific and technological achievements of Xi?an; Projects of major innovation platforms for scientific and technological and local transformation of scientific and technological achievements of Xi’an, (20GXSF0003); Xi?an University of Technology; Xi’an University of Technology, (101-451119017); Xi'an University of Technology, XUT; Education Department of Shaanxi Province, (20JK0803)","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the support from the Scientific Research Program Funded by Shaanxi Provincial Education Department (Program No.20JK0803); Projects of major innovation platforms for scientific and technological and local transformation of scientific and technological achievements of Xi’an (20GXSF0003); Research Start-up Project of Xi’an University of Technology [Grant No. 101-451119017] and Postdoctoral Program of Xi'an University of Technology.; Funding text 2: The authors would like to acknowledge the support from the Scientific Research Program Funded by Shaanxi Provincial Education Department (Program No.20JK0803); Projects of major innovation platforms for scientific and technological and local transformation of scientific and technological achievements of Xi?an (20GXSF0003); Research Start-up Project of Xi?an University of Technology [Grant No. 101-451119017] and Postdoctoral Program of Xi'an University of Technology.","Bartolo P.J., Stereolithography: materials, Processes and Applications, (2011); Bertsch A., Bernhard P., Renaud P., Microstereolithography: concepts and applications, ETFA 2001. 8th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation.

Here, we study the creation of hierarchically porous Fe or Ni scaffolds by 3D extrusion of 0/90° lattices from inks consisting of fine oxide powders (Fe2O3 or NiO, < 3 µm), coarse space-holder particles (CuSO4, < 45 µm) and a polymer binder within a solvent. After space-holder leaching and debinding of the lattices, a sintering step densifies the metallic Fe or Ni powders created by oxide reduction with H2, while maintaining the larger pores templated by the space-holder particles within the printed struts. The resulting Fe or Ni lattices exhibit a hierarchical porosity: (i) open submillimeter channels within the lattice between the printed struts; (ii) open micropores (5–50 µm) within the struts, from leaching of space-holder particles; (iii) closed submicron pores within the micropore walls, from incomplete sintering of the metal microparticles created by oxide reduction. While the channel porosity is defined by the printed geometry, strut porosity is controlled by the sintering temperature, with the finest porosity removed first. Sintering at 873–1373 K for 1 h leads to strut porosities of 38–19% in Fe and 59–29% in Ni. In situ synchrotron X-ray tomography reveals the sintering kinetics and porosity evolution upon debinding, oxide reduction by H2 and sintering of the porous metal, which, combined, lead to ~50% shrinkage of the scaffolds as compared to the printed state. The space-holder templated pores are not eliminated by sintering and remain in the struts, but they shrink upon reduction and sintering of the surrounding metal matrix (e.g., by 40% in Fe and by 30% in Ni upon sintering at 1173 K for 1 h). © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Bio-inspired; Porosity; Space holder; Tomography","3D printers; Copper compounds; Extrusion; Hematite; Iron; Leaching; Microporosity; Nickel oxide; Powder metals; Scaffolds; Struts; Hierarchical porosity; Hierarchically porous; In-situ synchrotrons; Oxide particles; Polymer binders; Porosity evolutions; Sintering kinetics; Sintering temperatures; Sintering","","","","","MatCI; Soft and Hybrid Nanotechnology Experimental, (NSF ECCS-1542205); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (NSTRF17); National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA; Office of Science, SC; Argonne National Laboratory, ANL, (DE-AC02-06CH11357); Argonne National Laboratory, ANL; Northwestern University, NU; American Pain Society, APS; Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, Harvard University, MRSEC, (NSF DMR-1720139); Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, Harvard University, MRSEC; Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, University of Nebraska, MRSEC; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (172180); Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF","Funding text 1: CK received funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation as an Early Postdoc Mobility fellowship under grant No. 172180.

Design/methodology/approach: The dynamic response of the process parameters on the bead width and bead height of cold metal transfer (CMT)-based AM was analyzed. A laser profile scanner was used to continuously capture the morphology variation. A prediction model of the deposition bead morphology was established using response surface optimization. Moreover, the validity of the model was examined using 15 groups of quadratic regression analyzes. Findings: The relative errors of the predicted bead width and height were all less than 5% compared with the experimental measurements. The model was then preliminarily used with necessary modifications, such as further considering the interlayer process parameters, to guide the fabrication of complex three-dimensional components. Originality/value: The morphology prediction of WAAMed bead is a critical issue. Most research has focused on the formability and defects in CMT-based WAAM and little research on the effect of process parameters on the morphology of the deposited layer in CMT-based WAAM has been conducted. To test the sensitivities of the processing parameters to bead size, the dynamic response of key parameters was investigated. A regression model was established to guide the process parameter optimization for subsequent multi-layer or component deposition. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bead morphology; Cold metal transfer;

The length of the weir crest (L), weir height, and weir width all affect the efficacy of compound broad crested weirs as flow monitoring devices. As a result, the flow characteristics of a given flume are determined by changes in weir geometry, particularly the discharge coefficient (Cd), which varies proportionally with the h/L ratio. For varying h/L levels, many researchers have maintained an average range of Cd. The experimental and Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations for measuring discharge by compound broad crested weir are presented in this work. Validation in the results is achieved using CFD FLOW 3D software. For enhanced accuracy in free surface simulations, the model uses the renormalized group (RNG) approach with the volume of fluid (VOF) method. Laboratory models were employed in an attempt to analyse and validate the CFD model. The model is fabricated using PVC material first and later resorted to additive manufacturing for targeting accurate discharges. The shape of the compound broad crested weir was modified to achieve constant Cd by comparing three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics models to experimental measurements. The performance of the CBC weir for precise measurement of a wide range of discharges is confirmed by numerical simulations and experimental measurements, with a reasonably constant design input value of discharge coefficient of 0.6. When compared to empirical methods, CFD-based weir geometry optimization produces more exact model predictions. Moreover, manufacturing this optimized model with 3D printing technology using Poly Lactic Acid plastic material has validated the weir performance with accurate estimates between theoretical, experimental and CFD outputs. © 2021 All rights reserved, Legal Deposit.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; CFD; Compound Broad Crested Weir; Discharge coefficient; Flow 3D","","","","","","","","ACKERS P., WHITE W.R., HARRISON A.J.M., Weirs and flumes for flow measurement, (1978); AMIR HOSSEIN A., RAJARATNAM N., Discharge characteristics of weirs of finite crest length, Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, 135, 12, pp. 1081-1085, (2009); BIJANKHAN M., Di STEFANO C., FERRO V., KOUCHAKZADEH S., New stage discharge relationship for weirs of finite crest length, Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering, 140, 3, (2014); BILHAN O., CIHAN M., EMIN M., MILLER C.J., Experimental and CFD Analysis of Circular Labyrinth Weirs, Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering, ASCE, 144, 6, (2018); BOITEN W., PITLO H.R., The V-shaped broad-crested weir, Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering, 108, 2, pp. 142-160, (1982); BOS M.G., Discharge Measurement Structures, (1989); SALMASI FARZIN, POORESCANDAR SANAZ, HOSSEINZADEH DALIR ALI, DAVOOD FARSADI ZADEH, Discharge relations for rectangular broad crested weirs, Journal of Agricultural Sciences, 17, pp. 324-336, (2012); GOGUS M., DEFNE Z., ZKANDEMIR V., Broad-crested weirs with rectangular compound cross sections, Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering, 132, 3, pp. 272-280, (2006); HAGER W.H., SCHWALT M., Broad – crested weir, Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering, 120, 1, pp. 13-25, (1994); HARRISON A.J.M., The streamlined broad-crested weir, Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, 38, pp. 657-678, (1967); HINGE G.A., BALKRISHNA S., KHARE K.C., Improved Design of Stilling Basin for Deficient Tail Water, Journal of Basic and Applied Scientific Research, 1, 1, pp. 31-40, (2010); HINGE G.A., BALKRISHNA S., KHARE K.C., Experimental and Numerical Study of Compound Broad Crested Weir, International Journal of Fluids Engineering, 3, 2, pp. 197-202, (2011); HORTON R.E., Weir experiments, coefficients, and formulas, (1907); AL-KHATIB A., MUSTAFA GOGUS, Prediction models for discharge estimation in rectangular compound broad-crested weirs, Flow Measurement and Instrumentation, 36, pp. 1-8, (2014); KHAN L.A., WICKLEIN E.A., TEIXEIRA E.C., Validation of a Three-Dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics Model of a Contact Tank, Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, ASCE, 132, 7, pp. 741-746, (2006); KINDSVATER C.E., CARTER R.W., Discharge Characteristics of Rectangular Thin-Plate Weirs, 124, (1959); KULIN G., COMPTON P.R., A Guide to Methods and Standards for the Measurement of Water Flow, (1975); KULKARNI K.H., HINGE G.A., Compound Broad Crested Weir for Measurement of Discharge – A Novel Approach, Proceedings, International Conference organized by Indian Society of Hydraulics – ISH HYDRO, pp. 678-687, (2017); KULKARNI K.H., HINGE G.A., Experimental study for measuring discharge through compound broad crested weir, Flow Measurement and Instrumentation, 75, (2020); GOGUS MUSTAFA, AL-KHATIB ISSAM A., ATALAY AHMET E., JUMANA I.

This paper reports a study into the impact of 3D printing parameters (temperature, print speed, layer height) on mechanical parameters (strength, elasticity module), as well as on the accuracy of printing and roughness of the surface of a specimen based on thermoplastic (PLA plastic). Several batches of specimens were fabricated for this study in accordance with ASTM D638 and ASTM D695, which were tested for tension, geometric accuracy, and roughness. Based on the experimental data, regression analysis was carried out and the functional dependences of the strength, elasticity module, printing precision, roughness of a surface on 3D printing parameters (temperature, speed, thickness of the layer) were constructed. In addition, the derived mathematical model underlying a method of non-linear programming has established such printing parameters that could provide for the required properties of a structure. The analytical dependences reported in the current work demonstrate a high enough determination factor in the examined range of parameters. Using functional dependences during the design phase makes it possible to assess the feasibility of its manufacture with the required properties, reduce the time to work out the process of printing it, and give recommendations on the technological parameters of 3D printing. The re commendations from this study could be used to make PLA-plastic articles for va rious purposes with the required properties. Copyright © 2021, Authors.

Cumulative needs of high heat dissipation rates and structural requirements along with lightweight constraints have led to the development of several heat sink fins with lattice architectures in heat exchange-applications. Here, we numerically investigate the potential of polymer-based 3D printed lattice architectures as extended heat transfer surfaces and examine the forced-convection characteristics of simple-cubic, body-centered-cubic and face-centered-cubic trusses as well as simple-cubic plate, and Kelvin and Octet periodic lattices with mesostructured architecture. All these lattices have a porosity of 77% (relative density ~23%) and surface area density in the range of 1500−2400m2/m3. Thermal and hydraulic finite element studies were conducted for fluid flow over the lattice architectures for low Reynolds number in the range of 50−360 and constant wall temperature conditions. The performance of different cell-topologies is characterized in terms of exit fluid temperature, heat transfer coefficient with respect to different reference surface areas, pressure drop per unit length, Colburn factor j, Fanning friction factor f and area goodness factor j/f. The study of the influence of thermal conductivity on heat transfer rate reveals that the polymer-based architected heat sinks perform close to their metallic counterparts when evaluated on per unit mass basis. Furthermore, body-centered-cubic truss, simple-cubic plate, and Kelvin and Octet lattice-cells were found to exhibit better thermal performance than some microchannel and open-cell foam heat sinks. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","3D printing; Architected materials; Heat sinks; Heat transfer; Lattice materials; Thermal management","3D printers; Additives; Architecture; Flow of fluids; Heat sinks; Plates (structural components); Reynolds number; Thermal conductivity; Trusses; Constant wall temperature; Different length scale; Fanning friction factor; Finite-element study; Heat dissipation rates; Heat sink applications; Heat transfer surfaces; Structural requirements; Heat transfer performance","","","","","Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, ADNOC, (EX2016-000010); Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, ADNOC","The authors would like to thank Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) for providing the research grant under Award No: EX2016-000010 .","Vaezi M., Seitz H., Yang S., A review on 3D micro-additive manufacturing technologies, Int.

The proliferation of DC-DC converter is widely used for high power and low voltage applications. In such cases, the ultra-lift Luo converter is the suitable one compared to voltage lift VL Luo-converter and super-lift (SL) Luo-converters because of their limitations in voltage transfer gain and more voltage ripples. This paper proposes the proportional integral (PI) and fuzzy logic (FL) controllers for the fast and efficient operation of ultra-lift (UL) Luo-converter. An air breathing fuel cell (ABFC) stack is developed and which is taken as an input power source to the ultra-lift Luo-converter. This paper will give focus on design, mathematical analysis and operation of fuel cell powered DC-DC converter is incorporated with PI and FL controllers which are simulated using MATLAB/Simulink software. Furthermore, simulation results of ABFC are also presented to review the effects of temperature from 30°C-70°C in fuel cell voltage.

For purposes of convenience, the author assumes idyllic solutions (i.e. the excess energies associated with mixing solid and liquid phases can be neglected). Design/methodology/approach: In this work, the author applied the phase-field model through a progressive series of increasingly complex solidification problems, illustrating the evolution of both dendritic as well as columnar growth morphologies. Beginning with a non-isothermal treatment of pure Ni, the author further examined the isothermal and directional solidification of Cu–Ni binary alloys. Findings: (1) Consistent with previous simulation results, solidification simulations from each of the three cases revealed the presence of parabolic, dendrite tips evolving along directions of maximum interface energy. (2) For pure Ni simulations, changes in the anisotropy and noise magnitudes resulted in an increase of secondary dendritic branches and changes in the direction of propagation. The overall shape of the primary structure tended also to elongate with increased anisotropy. (3) For simulations of isothermal solidification of Ni–Cu binary alloys, the development of primary and secondary dendrite arm formation followed similar patterns associated with a pure substance. Calculations of dendrite tip velocity tended to increase monotonically with increasing anisotropy in accordance with previous research. (4) Simulations of directional solidification of Ni–Cu binary alloys with a linear temperature profile demonstrated the presence of cellular dendrites with relatively weak side-branching. The occurrence of solute trapping was also apparent between the primary dendrite columns. Dendrite tip velocities increased with increasing cooling rate. Originality/value: This research, particularly the section devoted to directional solidification of binary alloys, describes a novel numerical framework and platform for the parametric analysis of various microstructural related quantities, including the effects due to changes in temperature gradient and cooling rate.

The development of innovative approaches to digital equipment control that ensure the production of 3D building structures with high operational and technical-economic characteristics remains an urgent task. The handling and maintenance of technological equipment during the process of 3D-printing of construction objects do not always meet the modern requirements of technical systems management. Methods and materials. 3D-printing is based on the method of extrusion: molding of a building structure layer-by-layer with the addition and fairly rapid subsequent solidification of nanocomposite building materials. The resulting optimized nanocomposition must have the required rheology, which set the comb-like polycarboxylate esters with nanosteric repulsion at a distance of ≈ 11 nm. In order to organize a stable 3D-printing technology, it is also necessary to select the appropriate optimal fillers that provide the necessary physical, mechanical and operational characteristics to the hardened nanocomposite. Results. The effectiveness of three-dimensional printing calls for the coordinated operation of a construction-grade 3D-printer. In this regard, it is necessary to have concrete pumping equipment that is able to pump the initial nanocomposition through flexible pipelines at a certain speed. It is necessary to consider the influence of pressure and volume to increase the power of the concrete pump motor by 14–17%, and at the same tine reduce the level of vibrations. Discussion. Digital 3D-technologies reveal unique opportunities for innovative production of three-dimensional construction objects and engineering structures. Technological quality management of 3D-printing depends on the correct alignment of the printer mechanisms, and the reduction of defective products can be achieved by adjusting the molding parameters of building nanocomposites. The structure-forming curing of Portland cement nanocomposites is based on the formation of fractal structures of calcium hydrosilicate clusters with dimensions of 47–51 nm, that form nanoaggregates (125–132 nm), which gradually cement the fillers due to adhesive interactions. The high demand for the corresponding equipment only strengthens the advantages of 3D-additive technologies: its practical waste-free operation, low power consumption of 3D-printers, time reduction of design-to-completion process by 8–11 times. Conclusions. Technological managing of concrete pump equipment for 3D-additive printing of building nanocomposites reduces energy costs by 26–29%, and at the same time reduces the level of vibration. © Ivanova O.V., Khalikov R.M., Salov A.S., Nizamutdinov M.Kh., Zinnatullin V.V., 2021.","3D-printer; 3D-printing of nanocompositions; Additive nanotechnology; Concrete pumps; Digital construction; Quality management","","","","","","","","Slavcheva G.S., Artamonova O.V., The control of rheological behaviour for 3D-printable building mixtures: experimental evaluation of «nano» tools prospects, Nanotechnologies in Construction, 11, 3, pp. 325-334, (2019); Kolesnikov A.G., Modernization of the construction of the extruder of a construction 3D-printer and the selec-tion of compositions for it, Urbanistics, 2, pp. 64-70, (2019); Slavcheva G.S., Akulova I.I., Vernigora I.V., Concept and effectiveness of 3D printing for urban environment design, Housing Construction, 3, pp. 49-55, (2020); Sergeyeva O.Yu., Additive technologies and 3D modeling, Nanotechnologies in Construction, 10, 4, pp. 142-158, (2018); Khalikov R.M., Ivanova O.V., Korotkova L.N., Sinitsin D.A., Supramolecular impact mechanism of poly-carboxylate superplasticizers on controlled hardening building nanocomposites, Nanotechnologies in Construction, 12, 5, pp. 250-255, (2020); Chernishov E.M., Artamonova O.V., Slavcheva G.S., Nanomodification of cement-based composites in the technological life cycle, Nanotechnologies in Construction, 12, 3, pp. 130-139, (2020); Ivanov L.A., Xu L.D., Bokova E.S., Et al., Nanotechnologies: are view of inventions and utility models.

In this study, the Ti6Al4V coaxial scaffolds with five types of beam angles and three types of pore sizes were designed using CAD and fabricated with the use of SLM. The porous characteristics and mechanical properties of scaffolds were investigated systematically. The results show that the porosity of the coaxial scaffolds is 63–69%, and the pore size is 480–700 mm. Meanwihle, the elastic modulus and compressive strength of the coaxial scaffolds were 1.08–1.85 GPa, 40–88 MPa, respectively. Moreover, the fatigue strength of the coaxial scaffolds with 500–40°, 600–40°, 700–40° were 1387, 1110 and 420 MPa, respectively. The pore size and porosity of the coaxial scaffolds in our study satisfied the size requirements for bone cells growth. Meanwhile, the low elastic modulus and high fatigue strength of the scaffolds also met the bio-mechanical bearing requirements of cancellous bone implants.

An intensive management system is required for the cloud environment, and it should gather information about all phases of task processing and ensuring fair resource provisioning through the levels of Quality of Service (QoS). Virtual machine allocation is a major issue in the cloud environment that contributes to energy consumption and asset utilization in distributed cloud computing. Subsequently, in this paper, a multiobjective Emperor Penguin Optimization (EPO) algorithm is proposed to allocate the virtual machines with power utilization in a heterogeneous cloud environment. The proposed method is analyzed to make it suitable for virtual machines in the data center through Binary Gravity Search Algorithm (BGSA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). To compare with other strategies, EPO is energy-efficient and there are significant differences. The results of the proposed system have been evaluated through the JAVA simulation platform. The exploratory outcome presents that the proposed EPO-based system is very effective in limiting energy consumption, SLA violation (SLAV), and enlarging QoS requirements for giving capable cloud service.  © 2021 Jitendra Kumar Samriya et al.","","Ant colony optimization; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Green computing; Information management; Network security; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Quality of service; Virtual machine; Access to resources; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Cloud computing environments; Distributed processing; Energy minimization; Intensive management; Java simulation platform; Virtual machine allocations; Cloud computing","","","","","Taif University, TU, (TURSP-2020/55)","The authors thank Taif University for its support under the Taif University Researchers Supporting Project no.

Several drawbacks of parts produced using AM are still unresolved, like poor surface quality, the presence of internal defects and anisotropic mechanical behaviour, which all contribute to decreasing the fatigue strength compared with the material produced using conventional processes. The effect of building direction on both the macroscopic mechanical behaviour and the crack propagation mechanism of Ni-base superalloy Inconel718 produced using AM was investigated under the combined effect of low cycle fatigue (LCF) and high temperature. The different crack growth mechanisms investigated using compact tension (CT) specimens, tested at high temperature, showed a significant difference between the two building directions. The LCF fatigue experiments also showed a significant difference in the ε-N curves from the two directions together with a high level of scatter due to the dispersion of the defect size at the fracture origin. The dimensions of the defects (as measured using the (Formula presented.) parameter) were analysed by means of extreme value statistics and showed a significant difference between the two orientations investigated. The aim of this work is to propose a simplified approach (based on ΔJeff concepts) to estimate the fatigue life of a component produced using AM that takes into account the material variability due to the combined effect of mechanical anisotropic behaviour and the presence of defects at high-temperature conditions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","additive manufacturing; high temperature; Inconel718; low cycle fatigue; nickel based superalloy; selective laser melting","3D printers; Anisotropy; Crack propagation; Mechanisms; Nickel alloys; Thermal fatigue; Anisotropic behaviours; Compact tension specimen; Crack-growth mechanisms; Extreme value statistics; High temperature condition; Material variability; Mechanical behaviour; Propagation mechanism; Cracks","","","","","","","Chlebus E., Gruber K., Kuznicka B., Kurzac J., Kurzynowski T., Effect of heat treatment on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Inconel 718 processed by selective laser melting, Mater Sci Eng a, 639, pp. 647-655, (2015); Attallah M.M., Jennings R., Wang X., Carter L.N., Additive manufacturing of Ni-based superalloys: the outstanding issues, MRS Bull, 41, 10, pp. 758-764, (2016); Soller S., Barata A., Beyer S., Dahlhaus A., Guichard D., Humbert E., Kretschmer J., Zeiss W., Selective laser melting (SLM) of Inconel 718 and stainless steel injectors for liquid rocket engines, Sp.

Though numerous DC-DC converter is available for increasing the voltage gain, the passive elements requirement is higher which reduces the compactness, consequently, increases the cost of the system. To address this issue, a high gain DC-DC converter is reported recently. However, the number of passive elements is quite high which increases the size. To reduce the number of passive elements and maintain the same number of semiconductor devices, in this paper, a new switched inductor arrangement is proposed which is named as switched inductor double switch DC-DC converter (SL-DS-DC). Moreover, the proposed converter has a higher gain as compared to the recently reported converter. The proposed converter is analyzed in steady state and a comparative analysis is presented to prove the suitability. Finally, the proposed converter is validated experimentally.  © 2013 IEEE.","CCM; DC-DC converter; High voltage gain; non isolated; switched inductor","Electric inductors; Gain measurement; HVDC power transmission; Semiconductor devices; Comparative analysis; High gain; High voltage gain; Passive elements; Steady state; Switched inductors; Voltage gain; DC-DC converters","","","","","Guangdong Province Basic and Applied Basic Research, (2019A1515110174, 2019A1515110997)","This work was supported by the Guangdong Province Basic and Applied Basic Research under Projects 2019A1515110997 and 2019A1515110174.","Ahmad A., Singh R.K., Beig A.R., Switched-capacitor based modified extended high gain switched boost Z-source inverters, Ieee Access, 7, pp. 179918-179928, (2019); Banerjee S., Ghosh A., Padmanaban S., Modeling and analysis of complex dynamics for dSPACE controlled closed-loop DC-DC boost converter, Int.

Processing of the composite inks, which consist of highly loaded graphene nanoplatelets, first involves a detailed understanding of the underlying rheological properties. However, little is known about the effect of processing/print parameters, e.g., print speed has on the orientation of such 2D particles during the printing process and how this subsequently influences the macroscopic properties of the final cured composite. In this work, inks with solid loadings of 7−18 wt% were dispersed into a low viscosity epoxy resin (EPON 862) to form a shear thinning, viscoelastic material. The optimal GNP loading for printing is determined through rheological measurements, and the electrical properties are measured as a function of particle concentration and print speed. The results show a sharp increase in conductivity by a factor of ten as the print speed is increased from 5 to 40 mm/s, and all printed samples had conductivities higher than 10−3 S/cm. We attribute this change in conductivity to the shear stresses generated during the deposition of the ink, resulting in a shift in the orientation of the 2D platelet-like fillers. Such results showcase the ability to tune the electrical properties of a printed structure with a constant loading of filler. The present work helps develop design rules for processing of graphene-based 3D structures with enhanced properties (electrical) using additive manufacturing. We envision the use of such structures in a number of applications such as thermal interface materials, shielding materials for electronic devices, and light-emitting devices, to name a few. © 2020","3D printing; Complex fluids; Conductive inks; Direct ink writing; Graphene nanoplatelets; Rheology","3D printers; Epoxy resins; Fillers; Graphene; Graphene Nanoplatelets; Graphite; Graphite epoxy composites; Light emission; Rheology; Shear stress; Shear thinning; Viscoelasticity; Light emitting devices; Low viscosity epoxy resin; Macroscopic properties; Particle concentrations; Rheological measurements; Rheological property; Thermal interface materials; Visco-elastic material; Structural properties","","","","","State of Florida S.; Wright-Patterson Air Force Base; State of FloridaS; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1735968, DMR-1644779, 1623206)","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation award [ 1735968 ].

The channel flow of Bingham fluid concerns the flow of cement paste in the building industry and the mudflow in the drilling industry. The specific aim is to introduce the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) phenomena specified by both Ion-slip and Hall currents into the non-isothermal channel flow in a theoretical approach. The Bingham constitutive equation is formulated by the generalized Newtonian fluid technique and solved by employing the explicit Finite Difference Method (FDM) using the MATLAB R2015a and Compaq Visual FORTRAN 6.6a both. For the exactness of numerical performance estimations, the criteria for stabilization and the convergence factor are analyzed. The velocity and temperature profiles are discussed individually at the moving and stationary walls of the channel. It is observed that magnetohydrodynamic phenomena accelerate the flow, and the temperature distributions reach the steady-state situation earlier than velocity distributions. Furthermore, the dominance of MHD parameters on the velocity distributions, shear stress, temperature distributions, and Nusselt number are discussed. © 2021, The Author(s).","Bingham fluid; Finite difference method (FDM); Hall current; Ion-slip current; MHD flow; Stability analysis","Cement industry; Channel flow; Construction industry; Finite difference method; Isotherms; Newtonian liquids; Shear flow; Shear stress; Temperature distribution; Velocity; Velocity distribution; Couette-Poiseuille flow; Explicit finite difference method; Generalized Newtonian fluid; Horizontal parallel plates; Numerical performance; Temperature profiles; Theoretical approach; Velocity and temperature fields; Magnetohydrodynamics","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, MOST, (39.00.0000.012.02.009.17-662); Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, MOST; National Science and Technology Planning Project","This research is funded by National Science and Technology under the Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh (Grant Number: 39.00.0000.012.02.009.17-662).

However, few studies have focused on strategies to improve green spaces in response to this trend. Especially, with the outbreak of COVID-19, an urgent need to develop a sustainable system strategy to improve the health of the elderly in residential communities in old districts has emerged. Traditional improvement strategies based on current situation evaluation often focus on the most prominent practical problems. Therefore, the objective of this study was to provide theoretical research and practical improvement strategies for green open spaces in old downtown residential communities to improve the health and well-being of the elderly. In response to this problem, this research proposes an alternative method based on causality (FDM-DANP-mV model), by extracting 23 green open space elements that affect the health of the elderly and dividing them into three dimensions, to form a preliminary evaluation framework. On this basis, the more effective and feasible standard elements are screened out, and the influence relationship behind the elements is clarified. Then, the sustainable development strategy is systematically discussed in three practical cases. This allows for the analysis of the present situation to not only identify the current significant problems but also to capture the source of the influence behind the real problems based on the clarification of the dominant influence relationship. The actual value of this study is to provide a key design decision basis for the improvement of the green open spaces in old downtown residential communities, aiming at avoiding waste to the greatest extent under the premise of limited resources and gradually promoting the improvement of the urban built environment to promote the health and well-being of the elderly.

Conduction band alignment of the superlattice is obtained by using effective mass approximation. 1d-Schrodinger formula is solved by using FDM. Intersubband transition energies, linear (nonlinear and total) absorption coefficients and linear (nonlinear and total) refractive index changes are plotted under applied electric field intensity. Intersubband transition energy of electron from second excited state to first excited state shows 147 meV. It is found that-45 kV/cm electric field intensity and 5 nm layer thickness of last quantum well of the gain region are the best values for studied structure. After that, linear absorption coefficient is investigated dependent on carrier number in the injector region under electric field. It is found that carrier number over 5 x 1016 cm−2 can causes huge internal absorption of the radiative emission obtained in gain region due to increase in linear absorption coefficient by factor 10. As a conclusion, total absorption coefficient and total refractive index change are calculated for optimized parameters. © 2021, Gazi Universitesi.

Design/methodology/approach: The fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) is applied to validate and eliminate challenges in sustainability transition regarding qualitative information. Fuzzy interpretive structural modeling (FISM) is used to build a hierarchical framework under uncertainties. Findings: This study finds that technology investment, data management, eco-management and sociospatial embedding challenges are the highest hierarchical framework levels and affect CST. Practical implications: A lack of awareness and knowledge, a lack of commitment, a lack of strategy, tolerance of unsustainable practices, a lack of stakeholder participation and a fragmented market are perceived as the challenges that show the highest driving and dependence power. These challenges serve as a reference for government and construction firms in the transition to sustainable corporate practices. Originality/value: Unsustainable corporate practices have caused large amounts of energy consumption, resource depletion and environmental impacts. There are challenges in transitioning to corporate sustainability that must be addressed. The most significant challenges that need to be solved to facilitate the transition to corporate sustainability are identified and arranged in a hierarchical model. By identifying the hierarchical relationships among the challenges, a theoretical framework that extends the existing models is developed to assist decision-makers. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate sustainability;

Given the limitations of analytical solutions, we adopted the finite difference method (FDM) in this paper to approximate the classic three-region model and obtained an effective numerical solution in which the pressure-dependent dynamic properties, such as gas desorption; pressure, volume, and temperature (PVT) properties; various transport mechanisms; and stress-dependent fracture permeability are considered in the modeling. The results explain that (1) the production predicted with the numerical method is accurate for the nonlinearity in the model being dealt with properly; (2) the field case shows the veracity of the proposed approach, and gas production and estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) can be evaluated with this model; (3) gas viscosity and Z-factor have an important impact on the initial production, which should be emphasized in rate transient analysis (RTA) for early-time production; slippage flow and diffusion of shale gas increase the productivity of gas wells; desorption in shale matrix can enhance middle- and long-term production; and the stress-sensitive effect and heterogeneity of SRV obstruct gas flow and reduce the total gas production; and (4) an optimized production strategy for controlling pressure drawdown is of great importance. Consequently, the refracturing treatment might be an effective measure to alleviating formation pressure drawdown, improving gas desorption and SRV permeability. © 2021 by Begell House, Inc.","Heterogeneous SRV; Nonlinear flow mechanisms; Shale gas; Three-region model","Analytical models; Desorption; Finite difference method; Flow of gases; Gas permeability; Gases; Natural gas well production; Natural gas wells; Numerical methods; Transient analysis; Flow mechanisms; Gas desorption; Gas well; Heterogeneous stimulated reservoir volume; Nonlinear flow; Nonlinear flow mechanism; Region models; Stimulated reservoir volumes; Three-region model; Transport mechanism; Shale gas","","","","","China Petroleum Science and Technology Program, (ZLZX2020-02-04); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51774297, U1762210, U19B6003); National Major Science and Technology Projects of China, (2017ZX05069)","This study is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos.

A spatial light modulator (SLM) was employed to vary the phases in each pixel continuously in the flame-phase measurement. The uniqueness of the phase extraction was mathematically proved for the first time, and a least square method was applied to recover the profile of flame phase in the interferometer. The ambiguity of the phases at different cycles of 2\pi was eliminated. The phase shift at each pixel was uniquely determined and verified by using simulated data. Further, precise-phase distributions were utilized to retrieve the temperature distribution in a laminar flame. In actual experiments, four axisymmetric laminar flames from diffused to premixed flames were generated by using a Bunsen burner. Profiles of temperature distribution in the flames were extracted and agreed well with the results scanned by using a thermocouple. With the increase of airflow rate, the position of high-temperature zone was observed moving down, and the thermal structure of the premixed flame became more and more obvious. The preheating zone, reaction front, and reaction zone inside the flames were clearly captured. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Axisymmetric flame; large lateral shearing interferometer; phase modulation and demodulation; single-wavelength laser; temperature distribution","Interferometers; Least squares approximations; Phase modulation; Pixels; Shearing; Temperature distribution; Thermocouples; Actual experiments; High temperature zones; Lateral shearing interferometer; Least square methods; Phase distribution; Phase modulation and demodulation; Single wavelength; Spatial light modulators; Light modulators","","","","","Newton Advanced Fellowship, (NAF191193); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61620106004, 61827802, 61961130393, 62031002)","Manuscript received January 13, 2021; revised February 19, 2021; accepted February 22, 2021.

The role played by the usually referred technological pillars of I4.0 (such as internet of things (IoT), horizontal and vertical system integration, simulation, autonomous robots, big data and analytics, augmented reality, additive manufacturing, cloud computing and cybersecurity), based on technological advancements (mainly Information and Communications Technology (ICT)), in adhering to I4.0, are well known by the industry and academia (attending the huge number of research papers available), and have being implemented with more or less success. Notwithstanding the significant expected opportunities and impact of the fourth industrial revolution identified by researchers, experts are not convinced that the changes will be as significant as forecasted [2 - 4]. According to [5], only rare and recent attempts to understand the critical success factors of I4.0 implementation in manufacturing companies can be found in literature. A few recent studies reviewed in [5], point out that some of the critical factors are related to the management for I4.0. Cumulatively, the research in the field of management for I4.0, is still scarce, compared with the research on technologies for I4.0. The title of this Special Issue “Manufacturing System and Enterprise Management for Industry 4.0” is aligned with that concern and its content should be seen as a contribution to overcome management deficit problem of I4.0 implementation success.

Thermosets offer attractive mechanical properties while providing excellent interlayer bonding, high thermal and chemical stability, and reduced energy consumption as a result of deposition at room temperature. However, since thermoset resins rely on a crosslinking reaction to solidify, rather than quickly cooling like thermoplastics, viscoelastic properties must be relied upon to maintain deposited shape after deposition until crosslinking can occur. This fact has not impeded development and characterization of new thermoset feedstocks on the small scale, but recent efforts to increase scale of thermoset printing have highlighted issues with structural stability under self-weight. This study addresses issues of self-weight by investigating the mechanisms that cause collapse of tall, thin printed walls. Using nanoclay- and fumed silica-filled epoxy feedstocks, this work compares the collapse height for printed walls to stability models based on yielding and buckling mechanics. Inputs for these models – shear yield stress and storage modulus – were taken directly from parallel plate rheometry measurements. Model predictions were found to be in good agreement with experimental results, where both yielding and buckling behavior were observed, provided the rheological properties after a shear excursion were used as inputs. This work establishes a direct link between basic rheological properties of the feedstock, geometry of the printed object, and achievable height. The results presented highlight the importance of understanding recovery behavior in thermoset feedstocks and provide valuable guidance on the development of more effective direct-ink writing feedstock materials. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Buckling; Composites; Direct-ink writing; Rheology; Self-weight; Stability; Thermoset","Buckling; Chemical bonds; Chemical stability; Crosslinking; Deposition; Energy utilization; Feedstocks; Nanocomposites; Reinforced plastics; Rheology; Scales (weighing instruments); Silica; Thermosets; Viscoelasticity; Yield stress; Buckling behaviors; Crosslinking reaction; Feedstock materials; Printed structures; Rheological property; Rheometry measurement; Structural stabilities; Viscoelastic properties; 3D printers","","","","","Magnum Venus Products; Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Industrial Technologies Program; Polynt-Reichhold; US Department of Energy; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE, (DE-AC05-00OR22725, DE-NA0002839); Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE; University of Tennessee, UT","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Industrial Technologies Program, under contract DE-AC05-00OR22725 with UT-Battelle, LLC.

This supply chain design requires the development of flexibility as a critical capability. To this end, firms are considering Additive Manufacturing (AM) as one strategic option that could enable such a capability. This paper develops a conceptual model that maps AM characteristics relevant to flexibility against key market disruption scenarios. Following the development of this model, a case study is undertaken to indicate the impact of adopting AM on supply chain flexibility from four major flexibility-related aspects: volume, mix, delivery, and new product introduction. An inter-process comparison is implemented in this case study using data collected from a manufacturing company that produces pipe fittings using Injection Moulding (IM). The supply chain employing IM in this case study shows greater volume and delivery flexibility levels (i.e., 65.68% and 92.8% for IM compared to 58.70% and 75.35% for AM, respectively) while the AM supply chain shows greater mix and new product introduction flexibility, indicated by the lower changeover time and cost of new product introduction to the system (i.e., 0.33 h and €0 for AM compared to 4.91 h and €30,000 for IM, respectively). This work will allow decision-makers to take timely decisions by providing useful information on the effect of AM adoption on supply chain flexibility in different sudden disruption scenarios such as demand uncertainty, demand variability, lead-time compression and product variety. © 2021 by the authors.

Important to the commercialization of MC materials are: (1) establishment of a fabrication method that can combine high surface area for heat transfer and geometric freedom for designing an efficient heat exchanger which has low pressure drop for the coolant and (2) advancement of low cost alloys with appropriate MC properties. In this regard, additive manufacturing may provide the geometric freedom necessary for adapting designs to solid state cooling, and the Ni-Mn(Cu)-Ga Heusler ferromagnetic shape memory alloys (FSMAs), exhibiting a martensitic para-ferromagnetic transformation at Tms=304 K, can provide a low-cost MC material, very promising for magnetic cooling. In this study, a Ni49.5Mn19.1Cu6.6Ga24.8 (at.%) alloy is additively manufactured using powder bed binder jet 3D printing with subsequent sintering. This printed and sintered material enabled a large change of magnetization during partial transformation cycles with the smallest temperature hysteresis recorded for FSMAs, equal to about 1.2 K, regardless of the value of magnetic field applied. Under 2 T and at 304 K it exhibits an adiabatic temperature change (ΔTad) of 2 K and a stable cycling behavior of ΔTad = │1.7│ K for 100 cycles. The maximum of magnetic field-induced entropy change |ΔSm, 2T| ≈ 12.0 J/kg·K was estimated at 304 K. These results demonstrate the viability of powder bed binder jet 3D printing as an effective fabrication method for functional magnetocalorics, as well as the outstanding MC characteristics of a low-cost Ni-Mn(Cu)-Ga Heusler-type FSMA. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Binder jetting; Magnetic shape memory alloy; Magnetocaloric effect; Martensitic transformation; Ni-Mn(Cu)-Ga alloy; Powder bed; Sintering","Additives; Copper alloys; Costs; Ferromagnetic materials; Ferromagnetism; Gallium alloys; Heat exchangers; Heat transfer; Hysteresis; Industrial research; Magnetic fields; Manganese alloys; Martensite; Martensitic transformations; Mathematical transformations; Shape-memory alloy; Sintering; Adiabatic temperature change; Fabrication method; Ferromagnetic shape memory alloys (FSMAs); Ferromagnetic transformations; Magnetocaloric materials; Partial transformation; Solid-state cooling; Temperature hysteresis; 3D printers","","","","","Basque Government Department of Education, (IT1245-19); Mascaro Center for Sustainable Innovation; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1727676); National Science Foundation, NSF; Office of Naval Research, ONR; Army Research Office, ARO; Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL; Mascaro Center for Sustainable Innovation, University of Pittsburgh, MCSI, PITT; University of Pittsburgh; Edge Hill University, EHU; National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate, NDSEG; European Commission, EC; Universitat Politècnica de València, UPV; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (RTI2018-094683-B-C53); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","Funding text 1: This work was performed at the Nanoscale Fabrication and Characterization Facility, a laboratory of the Gertrude E. and John M.

The sintering step normally required to improve the strength of the ceramic scaffolds precludes the addition of any biomolecules or functional particles before this stage. This study presents a proof of concept of multifunctional CaP-based scaffolds, fabricated by additive manufacturing from an innovative ink composition, with potential for bone regeneration, cancer treatment by local magnetic hyperthermia and drug delivery platforms. Highly loaded inks comprising iron-doped hydroxyapatite and β-tricalcium phosphate powders suspended in a chitosan-based solution, in the presence of levofloxacin (LEV) as model drug and magnetic nanoparticles (MNP), were developed. The sintering step was removed from the production process, and the integrity of the printed scaffolds was assured by the polymerization capacity of the ink composite, using genipin as a crosslinking agent. The effects of MNP and LEV on the inks' rheological properties, as well as on the mechanical and structural behaviour of non-doped and iron-doped scaffolds, were evaluated. Magnetic and magneto-thermal response, drug delivery and biological performance, such as cell proliferation in the absence and presence of an applied magnetic field, were also assessed. The addition of a constant amount of MNP in the iron-doped and non-doped CaP-based inks enhances their magnetic response and induction heating, with these effects more pronounced for the iron-doped CaP-based ink. These results suggest a synergistic effect between the iron-doped CaP-based powders and the MNP due to ferro/ferrimagnetic interactions. Furthermore, the iron presence enhances human mesenchymal stem cell metabolic activity and proliferation. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.","bone regeneration; CaP-based powders; drug delivery; magnetic hyperthermia; magnetic nanoparticles; magnetic properties; robocasting","Biocompatible Materials; Bone Regeneration; Bone Substitutes; Calcium Phosphates; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Drug Delivery Systems; Durapatite; Humans; Ink; Iron; Levofloxacin; Magnetic Phenomena; Magnetite Nanoparticles; Materials Testing; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Porosity; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; 3D printers; Additives; Bone; Calcium phosphate; Cell culture; Cell proliferation; Controlled drug delivery; Hydroxyapatite; Hyperthermia therapy; Induction heating; Iron; Magnetic nanoparticles; Magnetism; Molecular biology; Polymerization; Powders; Sintering; Stem cells; Targeted drug delivery; Tissue regeneration; biomaterial; calcium phosphate; chitosan; ferromagnetic material; genipin; hydroxyapatite; ink; iron; levofloxacin; magnetic nanoparticle; molecular scaffold; beta-tricalcium phosphate; biomaterial; levofloxacin; magnetite nanoparticle; Applied magnetic fields; Beta tricalcium phosphate; Biological performance; Human mesenchymal stem cells; Magnetic hyperthermia; Manufacturing techniques; Synthetic bone grafts; Therapeutic functions; Article; cell metabolism; cell proliferation; controlled study; drug delivery system; drug release; heating; human; human cell; magnetic field; mesenchymal stem cell; particle size; polymerization; powder; robocasting; three dimensional printing; bone prosthesis; bone regeneration; cell culture; chemistry; cytology; magnetism; materials testing; metabolism; porosity; scanning electron microscopy; synthesis; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; Scaffolds (biology)","","calcium phosphate, 10103-46-5, 13767-12-9, 14358-97-5, 7758-87-4; chitosan, 9012-76-4; genipin, 6902-77-8; hydroxyapatite, 1306-06-5, 51198-94-8; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; levofloxacin, 100986-85-4, 138199-71-0; beta-tricalcium phosphate, ; Biocompatible Materials, ; Bone Substitutes, ; Calcium Phosphates, ; Durapatite, ; Iron, ; Levofloxacin, ; Magnetite Nanoparticles, ","","","","","Santos J, Reis R L, Gomes M E, Harnessing magnetic-mechano actuation in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, Trends Biotechnol, 33, pp. 471-479, (2015); Tishin A M, Shtil A A, Pyatakov A P, Zverev V I, Developing antitumor magnetic hyperthermia: principles, materials and devices Recent Pat, Anti-Cancer Drug Discovery, 11, pp. 360-375, (2016); Chichel A, Skowronek J, Kubaszewska M, Kanikowski M, Hyperthermia-description of a method and a review of clinical applications, Rep.

Thus far, numerous studies have confirmed that the biophysical cues of hydrogels, such as stiffness, are known to have a profound impact on mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation; however, their differentiation potential within 3D-bioprinted hydrogels is not completely understood. Here, we propose a protocol for the exploration of how the stiffness of alginate-gelatin (Alg-Gel) composite hydrogels (the widely used bioink) affects the differentiation of MSCs in the presence or absence of differentiation inducing factors. Methods: Two types of Alg-Gel composite hydrogels (Young's modulus: 50 kPa vs. 225 kPa) were bioprinted independently of porosity. Then, stiffness-induced biases towards adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of the embedded MSCs were analysed by co-staining with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and oil red O. The expression of specific markers at the gene level was detected after a 3-day culture. Results: Confocal microscopy indicated that all tested hydrogels supported MSC growth and viability during the culture period. Higher expression of adipogenic and osteogenic markers (ALP and lipoprotein lipase (LPL)) in stiffer 3D-bioprinted matrices demonstrated a more significant response of MSCs to stiffer hydrogels with respect to differentiation, which was more robust in differentiation-inducing medium. However, the LPL expression in stiffer 3D-bioprinted constructs was reduced at day 3 regardless of the presence of differentiation-inducing factors. Although MSCs embedded in softer hydrogels to some extent proceeded toward adipogenic and osteogenic lineages within a few days, their differentiation seemed to be slower and more limited. Interestingly, the hydrogel itself (without differentiation-inducing factors) exhibited a slight effect on whether MSCs differentiated towards an adipogenic or an osteogenic fate. Considering that the mechanoregulated protein Yes-associated protein (YAP) is involved in MSC fate decisions, we further found that inhibition of YAP significantly downregulated the expression of ALP and LPL in MSCs in stiffer constructs regardless of the induced growth factors present. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the differentiation of MSCs in 3D-bioprinted matrices is dependent on hydrogel stiffness, which emphasizes the importance of biophysical cues as a determinant of cellular behaviour. © The Author(s) 2020.

Design/methodology/approach: AM integration with I4.0 is attributed due to various reasons such as developing complex shapes with good quality, real-time data analysis, augmented reality and decentralized production. To enable the integration of AM and I4.0, a structural model is to be developed. TISM technique is used as a solution methodology. TISM approach supports establishing a contextual relationship-based structural model to recognize the influential factors. Cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) analysis has been used to validate the TISM model and to explore the driving and dependence power of each factor. Findings: The derived structural model indicated the dominant factors to be focused on. Dominant factors include sensor integration (F9), resolution (F12), small build volumes (F19), internet of things and lead time (F14). MICMAC analysis showed the number of driving, dependent, linkage and autonomous factors as 3, 2, 12 and 3, respectively. Research limitations/implications: In the present study, 20 factors are considered. In the future, additional factors could be considered based on advancements in I4.0 technologies. Practical implications: The study has practical relevance as it had been conducted based on inputs from industry practitioners. The industry decision-makers and practitioners may use the developed TISM model to understand the inter-relationship among the factors to take appropriate measures before adoption. Originality/value: The study on developing a structural model for analysis of factors influencing AM and I4.0 is the original contribution of the authors. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing; Industry 4.0; Layered manufacturing; Manufacturing systems; MICMAC analysis; Modeling; Structural model; Total interpretive structural modeling","3D printers; Additives; Augmented reality; Decision making; Industry 4.0; Integration; Quality control; Structural analysis; Contextual relationships; Decentralized production; Design/methodology/approach; Influential factors; Interpretive structural modeling; MAtrix multiplication; Real time data analysis; Solution methodology; Factor analysis","","","","","","","Agrawal R., Vinodh S., Application of total interpretive structural modelling (TISM) for analysis of factors influencing sustainable additive manufacturing: a case study, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 25, 7, pp. 1198-1223, (2019); Agrawal R., Vinodh S., Prioritizing drivers of industry 4.0 enabling additive manufacturing: a case study, Industry 4.0 and Advanced Manufacturing, pp. 25-34, (2021); Ajmera P., Jain V., Modelling the barriers of health 4.0–the fourth healthcare industrial revolution in India by TISM, Operations Management Research, 12, 3-4, pp. 129-145, (2019); Alabi M.O., de Beer D.J., Wichers H., Kloppers C.P., Framework for effective additive manufacturing education: a case study of South African universities, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 26, 5, pp. 801-826, (2019); Asdecker B., Felch V., Development of an industry 4.0 maturity model for the delivery process in supply chains, Journal of Modelling in Management, 13, 4, pp. 840-883, (2018); Bordron M., Mehdi-Souzani C., Bruneau O., Inline measurement strategy for additive manufacturing, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture, 233, 5, pp. 1402-1411, (2019); Ceruti A., Marzocca P., Liverani A., Bil C., Maintenance in aeronautics in an industry 4.0 context: the role of augmented reality and additive manufacturing, Journal of Computational Design and Engineering, 6, 4, pp. 516-526, (2019); Chong S., Pan G.T., Chin J., Show P., Yang T., Huang C.M., Integration of 3D printing and industry 4.0 into engineering teaching, Sustainability, 10, 11, (2018); D'Emilia G., Di Ilio A., Gaspari A., Natale E., Perilli R., Stamopoulos A.G., The role of measurement and simulation in additive manufacturing within the frame of industry 4.0, In 2019 II Workshop on Metrology for Industry 4.0 and IoT (MetroInd4. 0&IoT) IEEE, pp. 382-387, (2019); Dilberoglu U.M., Gharehpapagh B., Yaman U., Dolen M., The role of additive manufacturing in the era of industry 4.0, Procedia Manufacturing, 11, pp. 545-554, (2017); Elhoone H., Zhang T., Anwar M., Desai S., Cyber-based design for additive manufacturing using artificial neural networks for industry 4.0, International Journal of Production Research, 58, 9, pp. 2841-2861, (2020); Gaub H., Customization of mass-produced parts by combining injection molding and additive manufacturing with industry 4.0 technologies, Reinforced Plastics, 60, 6, pp. 401-404, (2016); Haleem A., Javaid M., Additive manufacturing applications in industry 4.0: a review, Journal of Industrial Integration and Management, 4, 4, (2019); Haleem A., Javaid M., Rab S., Impact of additive manufacturing in different areas of industry 4.0, International Journal of Logistics Systems and Management, 37, 2, (2020); Harikannan N., Vinodh S., Gurumurthy A., Sustainable industry 4.0 – an exploratory study for uncovering the drivers for integration, Journal of Modelling in Management, 16, 1, (2020); Hernandez Korner M.E., Lamban M.P., Albajez J.A., Santolaria J., Ng Corrales L.D.C., Royo J., Systematic Literature Review: Integration of Additive Manufacturing and Industry 4.0.

The proposed resonator is similar to that of the classical combline filter, however, in this case, a conical post (truncated cone) is exploited. A hollowed enclosure is positioned on top of a rectangular metallic cavity for housing the upper part of the conical resonating post. Considering that the post upper radius is smaller than the post lower radius, an enclosure having the same dimensions as the resonating post can be taken. This results in a housing that can also work as an additional resonator for another cavity. As a result, cavities can be piled in a vertical arrangement and the conical post of each cavity is also used for housing the post of the cavity below it. Mixed vertically and/or horizontally arrangements are also feasible. More compact structures can be achieved with the possibility to obtain different footprints while maintaining similar unloaded Q -factors than conventional combline filters. The structure also has the advantage of having a wider spurious-free range than the classical combline filter configuration (cylindrical post inside a rectangular cavity). Enhanced responses with higher rejections are also possible thanks to the introduction of transmission zeros. Several different filter configurations are presented in this article: 3-order filter and 4-order filter. The design procedure is explained for both of them. A 4-order filter has been manufactured using additive manufacturing techniques and measured in order to validate the proposed structure. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","3-D printing; Additive manufacturing; bandpass filter; combline filter; conical resonator","3D printers; Acoustic resonators; Enclosures; Housing; Q factor measurement; Compact bandpass filters; Compact structures; Cylindrical posts; Design procedure; Filter configuration; Manufacturing techniques; Rectangular cavity; Transmission zeros; Bandpass filters","","","","","Marie Skłodowska-Curie; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Horizon 2020, (811232)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program under the Marie Sklodowska- Curie through funds under Grant 811232.; Funding text 2: Manuscript received July 22, 2020; revised September 27, 2020; accepted September 28, 2020.

However, a rigorous evaluation method is required to further investigate the measurement method and efficiency before AM can be well-positioned in sustainable manufacturing and become the industry mainstream. Cost savings play a key role in the manufacturing industry. Compared to conventional manufacturing (CM), the cost of AM is volume-independent. In contrast, CM production requires a certain volume to share the initial tooling costs to achieve cost reduction. This constraint limits CM from service on demand and leaves ambiguity in the threshold setting of that critical batch volume. In addition, the invisibility of AM advantages in cost factors blocks AM technologies from appropriate processes and affects its applications. To address these issues, this paper proposes a business model. The major issues encountered by AM are the scaling, speed, and size of products. The enhancement of cost modeling and addressing speed, scale, and size issues are the novelties of this study and provide a breakthrough in AM issues. Generic equations are derived using the convergence effect and cost-volume intersection calculation between AM and CM. Furthermore, the divide-and-conquer approach is proposed to support scaling factors and dependencies for both AM and CM. Consequently, appropriate AM technologies can be compared with the CM convergence threshold to contribute to decision-making. Next, the advantages and weaknesses of AM are identified, and a collaboration pattern is proposed to connect large enterprises, small-and medium-sized enterprises, and home-based manufacturers into an AM society. Through this society, the advantages of AM can be fully exploited, scaling and speed issues can be addressed, and AM's dominant role in sustainable manufacturing can be made feasible. © 2021 H.

As the respiratory tract is considered to be potentially exposed to contamination during the implantation procedure there is a need to modify the implant with an antibacterial additives. The purpose of this work was to analyze the effect of biodegradable polymer - polycaprolactone (PCL) modification with various additives on its antibacterial properties. Methods: PCL filament modified with graphene (0.5%, 5%, 10% wt.), bioglass (0.4% wt.) and zinc doped bioglass (0.4% wt.) were used to print spatial biomaterials using FDM 3D printer. Pure polymer biomaterials without additives were used as reference samples. The key task was to assess the antimicrobial impact of the prepared biomaterials against the following microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25293, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Results: The research results point to a significant antibacterial efficacy of the tested materials against S. aureus and C. albicans, which, however, seems to decrease with increasing graphene content in the filaments. A complete lack of antibacterial efficacy against E. coli was determined. Conclusions: The tested biomaterials have important antibacterial properties, especially against C. albicans. The obtained results showed that biomaterials made of modified filaments can be successfully used in implantology, where a need to create temporary tissue scaffolds occurs. © 2021, Institute of Machine Design and Operation.

The heterogeneous nature of IIoT devices and services suggests frequent changes in resource requirements for different services, applications, and use cases. With such unpredictability, resource orchestration can be quite complicated even in basic use cases and almost impossible to handle in some extensively dynamic use cases. In this paper, we propose SDRM; an SDN-enabled Resource Management scheme. This novel orchestration methodology automatically computes the optimal resource allocation for different IIoT network models and dynamically adjust assigned resources based on predefined constraints to ensure Service Level Agreement (SLA). The proposed approach models resource allocation as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) where optimality is based on the solution of a predefined Satisfiability (SAT) problem. This model supports centralized management of all resources using a software defined approach. Such resources include memory, power, bandwidth, and edge-cloud resources. SDRM aims at accelerating efficient resource orchestration through dynamic workload balancing and edge-cloud resource utilization, thereby reducing the cost of IIoT system deployment and improving the overall ROI for adopting IIoT solutions. We model our resource allocation approach on SAVILE ROW using ESSENSE PRIME modeling language, we then implement the network model on CloudSimSDN and PureEdgeSim. We present a detailed analysis of the system architecture and the key technologies of the model. We finally demonstrate the efficiency of the model by presenting experimental results from a prototype system. Our test results show an extremely low solver time ranging from 0.47 ms to 0.5 ms for nodes ranging from 100 to 500 nodes. With edge-cloud collaboration, our results show about 4 percent improvement in overall task success rates. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Nanomaterial dynamics intrinsically exhibit higher order of visual scanning complexities, associate wholly or partially to the poor scanning instrumentations. Additionally, growing trends in analytical instrumentation towards smart Lab-On-a-Chip (IoT sensing nodes) have shifted the emphasis on sensitivity and robustness tailoring Product Specific Environment (PSE). This work presents a hybrid laser actuated scanning mechanism, rastered back and forth 3-D imaging technique enabling Microscopy to its widest application in biological and material sciences and hence rose challenge of predicting large missing or incorrect data obtained during experiments. Our Confocal Self Calibrated Interferometry based fabricated Laser Sensor demonstrates its efficacy in non-invasive scanning microscopy to achieve a highresolution 3D topographical view, eventually an add-on to the analytical model of microorganisms and nanomaterial. In contrast to linear controllers, PI controllers demonstrate better stability in controlling the laser leakage at tip, which consists of two channel tube adjustments and successively in laser reflector lens, Photo Multiplier Tube (PMT), and Data Acquisition Unit (DAU). We expose our results for error propagation across various grid patterns over a 1mm2 section, plotting the intensity of a key band or bands over the PMT grid. We observe that the instrumentation errors can be nullified by modeling the ergodicity of information flow along with the SLM instrumentation. © 2021.

Among several methods in the generation and detection of THz waves, a THz time-domain system that is developed using photoconductive antennas (PCA) as emitter and detector presents several advantages such as simple alignment, low cost, high performance etc. In this work, we report the design, fabrication and characterization of a 2-D PCA array that is capable of detecting both the amplitude and phase of the THz pulse. The PCA array is fabricated using LT-GaAs and has 8 channels with 64 pixels (8 × 8). A novel approach using a spatial light modulator (SLM) to steer and focus the infrared probe beam towards pixels of the PCA array is presented. Each channel records the photocurrent generated by the THz signal (amplitude and phase) separately and frequencies up to 1.4 THz can be detected. Furthermore, the parameters such as directional time delay of the THz pulse, crosstalk between the channels etc., were characterized. Finally, we show that the proposed 2D PCA array design is flexible and can be used for accelerated THz spectral image acquisition. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Also, the proposed cell provides constant temperature control using a small-sized thermostating unit built on Peltier elements and digital boards of W1209 thermostats. The cell was made using 3D printing with ABS plastic by the fused deposition method (FDM), followed by a sealing stage using a solution of polymethyl methacrylate dissolved in dichloroethane. In the course of the research, the use of a green laser with a wavelength of 520 nm was substantiated. Separately, the linearity of optical readings, the dependence of the indicators of the optical characteristics measurement system on temperature, as well as the uniformity of electrolyte heating in the cell, were studied. In addition, the pattern of the electric field was determined, which was an indicator of the uniformity of the current density distribution on the measured electrode. The obtained dependences made it possible to assert that the characteristics of the cell and the measuring system as a whole are suitable for the stated research purposes. It was also shown that the cost of the cell, together with the optical measuring system and the constant temperature control system, is more than two times cheaper than simple electrochemical cells offered by manufacturers. The proposed algorithm for the development of the cell design, the approach to the selection of components, as well as the given technical details, allow us to manufacture measuring equipment for the specific goals of the researcher. In this case, the given schematic, structural, and hardware solutions can be used separately from each other © 2021, Authors.","3D printing; electrochemical characteristics; electrochromism; KOH; measuring cell; optical characteristics","","","","","","","","Granqvist C.

Methods: The study included 27 women aged 20 to 25 years. The Zebris FDM-2 dynamographic platform was used in foot pressure measurements. The load distribution was measured in three types of orthopaedic footwear: MedSurg, MedSurgPro and OrthoWedge. The full gait cycle was recorded. The Cavanagh masks were applied to the load distribution results processed into a graphic form. The data were analysed using Statistica v.13.1. Results: In the forefoot area, i.e. the metatarsal bones and toes 1 to 5, the lowest loads were reported in the shoes that off-load the forefoot (0.2 N/cm2, p<0.001). In the area of the first to fifth metatarsal bones and the hallux, the highest load was observed in the rocker shoe, accounting for 19.7 N/cm2 (p<0.001). For comparison, high pressure in the flat shoe was found in the area of toes 2 to 5 (p<0.001). Conclusions: In the area of the metatarsal and toe bones, the pressure exerted was highest in the commonly used rocker shoe. The flat shoe provides an even and uniform load in all areas of the forefoot, while this type of shoe does not significantly reduce the pressure forces on the forefoot. The shoe that was the most effective in off-loading was the forefoot off-loading shoe (OrthoWedge). Barefoot walking puts less load on the forefoot compared to the flat and rocker shoes used after orthopaedic procedures. © 2021, Institute of Machine Design and Operation.

The different performance parameters of square textured journal bearings with different bottom profiles are numerically investigated and compared with those of smooth journal bearing. There are five bottom profiles of this square texture: flat, curved, isosceles triangle (T1), oblique triangle (T2), and oblique triangle (T3). The static and dynamic coefficients are calculated by solving the steady-state Reynolds equation and the perturbation equations with FDM numerical technique. The performance characteristics under different texture distribution, depth, and bottom profiles are studied, and the current numerical results show that the selection of texture parameters is crucial to improve the static, dynamic, and stability performances of hydrodynamic journal bearing. Meanwhile, it is also found that the square texture with a flat bottom profile has a higher improvement in the values of static performance parameters in comparison to those other bottom profiles. Moreover, the simulation results indicate that the dynamic and stability performances improvement of textured journal bearing is also significant, especially when the eccentricity ratio is smaller.  © 2021 Peng Li et al.","","Equations of state;

However, the complex geometries fabricated using AM can result in high post-processing costs due to challenges associated with support removal, powder removal, and improving surface finish. To address these issues, this work introduces a novel, self-terminating etching process for Ti64 alloys that can remove support structures and trapped powder while also improving surface finish for both exterior and interior features. The component is first treated in a furnace to sulfidize the outer 50–150 µm of its surface and the supports. Next, this sulfide layer is selectively dissolved in a solution of 5 M H2SO4 and 0.25 M Na2MoO4. This solution readily dissolves sulfides without dissolving the Ti64 base metal and enables this etching process to be uniquely self-terminating at the sulfide/Ti64 interface. For this work, the amount of Ti64 converted to sulfides as a function of sulfidation temperature, the surface roughness before and after each sulfidation-dissolution cycle, and the microstructural evolution was quantified. The inherently self-terminating nature of this novel process means that, for the first time, post-processing of Ti64 components can be done in a geometry agnostic manner with the knowledge that a specified and known amount of material will be removed from all surfaces. As a result, support structures and trapped powder can be removed with ease at the same time that the surface finish is improved. This process is expected to reduce post-processing costs while expanding the design space for additively manufactured Ti64 parts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Dissolvable supports; Powder bed fusion; Ti-6Al-4V","3D printers; Additives; Aerospace industry; Dissolution; Finishing; Ground supports; Powder metals; Sodium compounds; Sulfur compounds; Surface roughness; Automated support; Complex geometries; Etching process; Post processing; Sulfide layers; Support structures; Surface finishes; Surface finishing; Etching","","","","","United States Department of Energy, (DE-EE0008166); National Science Foundation, NSF, (1944516); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-NA0002839)","Hildreth group gratefully acknowledges the support from the United States Department of Energy under contract agreement Grants #: DE-EE0008166 administred through the Department of Energy’s Kansas City National Security Campus, operated by Honeywell Federal Manufacturing & Technologies , LLC , under contract number DE-NA0002839 .

Moreover, it can respond to the growing demand for customized products and can reduce the impact on the environment by minimizing production waste. To maximize these benefits and overcome entry barriers, researchers have conducted part consolidation (PC) research to improve sustainability by reducing the number of components, or hybrid supply chain studies involving local AM service providers. This study aims to present a new supply chain that combines the advantages of both AM and CM systems to create and analyze the potential of an AM machine that can be made available for rent at a lower cost. In this study, a closed-loop supply chain with an AM hub (CLSCAM) is first designed. Thereafter, to support manufacturers in making the decision to adopt AM, two models are developed: sustainability (cost, environment, and time) evaluation model from the lifecycle perspective of CLSCAM, and a PC method is developed to maximize the three sustainability indices. Since the PC problem with complex product structure is an NP-hard problem, the genetic algorithm is employed as a solution method. Furthermore, an experimental analysis is conducted to validate the proposed model through a real-world application (testbed product). The results reveal that the AM hub and PC model can effectively improve the sustainability of the entire lifecycle. In particular, the results of improved sustainability per unit product in mass production scenarios demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed model. These results also demonstrate that the pre-manufacturing stage has the greatest impact on the cost sustainability index in the CLSCAM. It is further confirmed that the sustainability improvement effect of PC increases with increasing AM raw material consumption efficiency, volume reduction rate of PC. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Additive manufacturing hub; Closed-loop supply chain; Part consolidation; Sustainability evaluation","3D printers; Additives; Genetic algorithms; Life cycle; NP-hard; Supply chains; Closed-loop supply chain; Conventional manufacturing; Experimental analysis; Impact on the environment; Manufacturing stages; Number of components; Raw material consumption; Sustainability index; Sustainable development","","","","","Ministry of Science and ICT; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (NRF-2019R1F1A1061349); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","Funding text 1: This work was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT ( NRF-2019R1F1A1061349 ). ; Funding text 2: This work was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (NRF-2019R1F1A1061349).","(2012); Terner M., The current state, outcome and vision of additive manufacturing, J.

Design/methodology/approach: For the dimensional and structural analysis of the manufactured models, a portable 3D scanner was used to generate the mesh of its dimensions, and to compare them before and after the experiments, a roughness measuring system was also used to verify the roughness inside the models before and after the tests, as roughness is an important parameter because it directly affects the boundary layer. For the visualization of the flow, the non-intrusive schlieren optical technique was used. Findings: The experiments were carried out on the SCBT for Mach 2 flows, using the manufactured prototypes and showed that there was no structural and dimensional change of the model after the test batteries. It was found that the roughness presented by the material did not affect the quality of the flow generated. This shows that the investigated material can also be applied in experiments with supersonic flow. Originality/value: This paper presents that it is possible to use in ground test facilities, for the studies of supersonic flow (in cold condition), pieces and models manufactured by 3D printing without affecting the quality of the flow generated during the experiments. This study presents a new perspective to approach AM applied in the studies of supersonic flows. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive Manufacturing; Ground test facilities; Schlieren technique; Scramjet; Supersonic flows","Additives; Boundary layers; Combustion; Ramjet engines; Supersonic flow; Unmanned vehicles; Cold conditions; Design/methodology/approach; Dimensional changes; Ground test facilities; Manufacturing applications; Measuring systems; Optical technique; Supersonic combustion; 3D printers","","","","","COMAER; Comando da Aeronáutica; Divisão de Aerotermodinâmica e Hipersônica; Divisão de Suporte Tecnológico; EAH; Instituto de Estudos Avançados; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES","The authors would like to thank the Instituto de Estudos Avançados (IEAv), the Divisão de Aerotermodinâmica e Hipersônica (EAH), the Divisão de Suporte Tecnológico (Sutec), und the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) and Comando da Aeronáutica – COMAER.","Ahn S.H., Montero M., Odell D., Roundy S., Wright P.K., Anisotropic material properties of fused deposition modeling ABS, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 8, 4, pp. 248-257, (2002); Ministério da defesa; ministério da ciência e tecnologia, Concepção Estratégica: ciência, Tecnologia e Inovação de Interesse da Defesa Nacional, (2003); Campbell I., Bourell D., Ian G., Additive manufacturing: rapid prototyping comes of age, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 18, 4, pp. 255-258, (2012); Curran E.T., Murthy, S.N.B.

Third harmonic current injection in different operating stages of the machine is investigated, including normal operation and fault-tolerant operation. HL FSCW machine is validated to be suitable for injecting third harmonic current to enhance torque by both theoretical analysis and finite-element analysis (FEA), and compared with 20-slot/24-pole single-layer (SL) and double-layer (DL) FSCW machine under constant rms and peak harmonic injection. Besides, a novel flux weakening control method with third harmonic current injection is proposed, which improves torque and efficiency of HL FSCW machine. The influence of nonlinearity caused by stator core saturation and higher order harmonics contained in back electromotive force (EMF) is included in flux weakening operation with harmonic injection. Finally, fault-tolerant control of HL FSCW machine with one-phase open-circuit fault is investigated, and two compensatory strategies with and without third harmonic current injection are proposed. Torque ripple caused by one-phase open-circuit fault is suppressed effectively by the proposed strategies.  © 2013 IEEE.","fault-tolerant control; five-phase; flux weakening; fractional-slot concentrated winding (FSCW); open-circuit; Permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM); third harmonic injection","Electric windings; Fault tolerance; Synchronous motors; Winding; Back electromotive force; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Fault tolerant operations; Fractional slot concentrated windings; Fractional slot concentrated windings (FSCW); Higher order harmonics; One phase open circuits; Third harmonic current injection; Harmonic analysis","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51521003, 51777013, 51977048, 51991385); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 51991385, Grant 51521003, Grant 51977048, and Grant 51777013; and in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant HIT.

Laser additive manufacturing (LAM) technique shows the huge potential to faultlessly restore the damaged tip of SX turbine blades. In this study, the microstructure formation in the near-net-shape tip-remanufacturing process of SX superalloy is studied through LAM experiments and simulation. The results indicate that due to the asymmetric heat diffusion condition at the top surface edge of SX substrate, the increase of laser power destroys the symmetry of morphologic size and microstructure formation in the single-track bead with a rapidly increased melting depth at the left side. Disoriented grains at the right side of the sing-track bead multiply layer by layer, gradually irrupting the epitaxial-growth continuity of columnar dendrites and resultantly destroying the monocrystalline nature of remanufactured tip structure. The continuous forced cooling of substrate not only shrinks the bead morphologic size, but also inhibits the disoriented grains formation at the right side of the single-track bead by directionally enhancing the epitaxial-growth ability of columnar dendrites. With the optimized laser power 550 W and continuously cooling substrate to −20 °C, a near-net-shape remanufactured tip structure with completely SX microstructure is achieved. The results provide an effective method to control the microstructure formation in the laser additive tip-remanufacturing application of SX turbine blades via coupling adjusting the laser power and continuous substrate forced cooling. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Forced cooling; Laser additive remanufacturing; Microstructure; Single-crystal superalloy","Additives; Cooling; Dendrites (metallography); Epitaxial growth; Restoration; Single crystals; Superalloys; Turbine components; Columnar dendrites; Disoriented grains; Heat diffusions; Laser additive manufacturing; Microstructure formation; Monocrystalline; Remanufacturing process; Single crystal superalloys; Turbomachine blades","","","","","Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51905253); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2018A030310132); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, (JCYJ20190809152401680)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51905253), the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China (Grant No. 2018A030310132) and the Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission (Grant No. JCYJ20190809152401680).; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51905253 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China (Grant No. 2018A030310132 ) and the Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission (Grant No. JCYJ20190809152401680 ).","Flemings M.C., Solidification processing, Metall.

Flumes are typically fabricated from aluminum or fiberglass; however, these types of flumes can be costly if purchased commercially and may lack machine precision if custom fabricated. This limits availability for widespread monitoring by smaller municipalities, engineering firms, or researchers with limited budgets. Using 3D printing technology (additive manufacturing) to produce flumes is very cost-effective, but variability between flumes and materials has not been tested, and discharge equations have not been developed for 3D printed flumes. In this study, a laboratory-scale setup was used to develop discharge equations for two types of 3D printed flumes (0.122 m HS flume and 0.102 m Palmer-Bowlus flume) made from two 3D printing materials: polylactic acid (PLA) and polyethylene terephthalate glycol modified (PETG). Variability between the same type of flume and between different materials for the same type of flume was analyzed to evaluate the consistency of the discharge equation with flumes of the same type. Eight models were developed to fit each dataset (PLA, PETG, and combined PLA and PETG) for both flume types and evaluated for goodness-of-fit and information criteria (AIC and BIC for model parsimony) to select the discharge equation for each flume type. Discharge equations were consistent for the same type of flume across each print and across different print materials. The discharge equations of 3D printed 0.122 m HS flumes and 0.102 m Palmer-Bowlus flumes are Q = 0.45624 × H2.351 and Q = 0.0001176 + 1.309 × (H - 0.0174625)2.235, respectively. The discharge equations of both flume types had R2adj values greater than 97% for the measured data of each individual flume. Both 3D printed flumes were consistent in measuring flow and are suitable for hydrologic monitoring. © 2021 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Discharge equation; Flume; Hydrologic monitoring","Additives; Budget control; Cost effectiveness; Plastic bottles; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Discharge equations; Engineered structures; Engineering firms; Flow monitoring; Flume; Hydrologic monitoring; Machine precision; Polyethylene terephthalate glycols; data set; discharge; environmental monitoring; equation; precision; three-dimensional modeling; 3D printers","","","","","East Dakota Water Development District; South Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station, SDAES, (SD00H652-18)","The authors would like to acknowledge partial funding support from an EPA 319 Information and Education minigrant, the East Dakota Water Development District, and South Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station Hatch Project SD00H652-18.

Results showed that the addition of rice flour had significantly improved the product properties of FER including shape, color, transparency and texture. Compared to the control (CK), the contents of protein, fat and total dietary fiber (TDF) in FER decreased obviously (p < 0.05) with rice flour addition. The oat-rice FER's shape turned to plump and appearance was acceptable, and had higher water uptake ratio (WUR), elongation ratio and solid loss (SL) than CK. The hardness of FER significantly decreased (p < 0.05) after adding rice flour, and FER with 35 % rice flour ratio (35 % FER) had the highest sensory evaluation score (7.31 out of 9). Then 35 % FER was selected for further vitro activity study, and result showed that bile acid binding rates of 35 % FER were stronger than normal natural rice. © 2021 Japanese Society for Food Science and Technology.

Examination of the microstructure showed that the fabricated sample exhibits a layered morphology with arced deposit boundaries. Novel distributions and morphologies of various phases including β, α, α'' and ω were detected in the LENS-manufactured part which substantially differ to conventionally processed alloy counterparts. The β grains and subgrains spread over multiple deposits and layers, aligned to the build direction, forming a complex network microstructure comprising large highly textured columnar grains aligned to β phase <001> orientations. The α precipitates have needle-like shapes and are widely distributed across a majority of the deposited layers, whereas the nanoscale ω particles were present in regions absent of α precipitation. Localised, massively transformed α'' phase with a very long and curved rod-like shape and substantial surface defects was identified. The formation of these novel microstructural features is investigated and discussed in the context of the characteristics of the LENS fabrication process. The microstructures are attributed to the complex thermal history in the unique deposit-by-deposit and layer-by-layer method employed during LENS additive manufacturing in conjunction with the complex precipitation behaviours exhibited by TiNb-based alloys. The characteristics and formation mechanisms of the LENS-manufactured Ti−Nb−Zr−Mo−Sn alloy microstructures revealed here provide a basis to optimize LENS and post-LENS heat treatment processes to optimize microstructures for improved performance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Microstructure; Precipitate phase; Ti−Nb−Zr−Mo−Sn alloy","3D printers; Complex networks; Deposits; Heat treatment; Morphology; Surface defects; Textures; Tin alloys; Complex precipitation; Fabrication process; Formation mechanism; Heat treatment process; Laser engineered net shaping; Layer-by-layer methods; Microstructural features; Network microstructures; Precipitation (chemical)","","","","","","","Zhai Y., Lados D.A., Brown E.J., Vigilante G.N., Understanding the microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4V and Inconel 718 alloys manufactured by Laser Engineered Net Shaping, Addit.

Complex optimised shapes that were previously discarded because of prohibitive construction costs are now affordable. These new designs are obtained through the application of the biological growth method (BGM), which mimics the mechanism of growth that occurs with animal bones and tree trunks. Biological structural parts self-adapt their shape by promoting surface growth at more stressed locations. This behaviour can be adapted to the design optimisation of structural parts, which can be thickened or lightened by updating the shape of the finite element model used for stress analysis. The method used to modify the finite element mesh is a critical consideration, and this paper presents a mesh morphing approach based on radial basis functions (RBFs) that is suitable for complex industrial applications. The computational mesh of the solid part is controlled by using BGM-driven algorithms to reshape its surfaces, which are sculpted by moving them inward or outward in a direction parallel to the local surface normal of the geometry. The deformation is propagated into the volume by interpolating the mesh field using RBFs. The bi-harmonic global-supported RBFs maintain a high quality mesh even for large deformations. The proposed approach is demonstrated using an industrial implementation based on the ANSYS Mechanical finite element solver and the mesh morphing extension RBF Morph. The first example studied is a cantilever beam with an initial rectangular cross section, and a 33% reduction in mass is achieved. A second example consists of a complex-shaped turbine blade, for which significant reductions in peak stress are obtained at three hotspots located on the blade fillet. © 2020","Biological growth method;

These mortars are mainly used in floor systems and have a large area exposed to the external environment, which facilitates water loss and increases the risk of cracking due to drying shrinkage. This study, in order to verify the influence of filler on the production of SLMs, used for comparative effect, quartz filler (QF) and crushed basalt filler (BF), in addition to limestone filler (LF), in contents of 5%, 10% and 20% of the mass of total solid. For that purpose, the tests of spreading in the fresh state and flexural strength, compressive strength, dynamic modulus of elasticity, drying shrinkage and desorption isotherm in the hardened state were carried out. SLMs microstructure was evaluated through isothermal calorimetry. The results show that the use of LF provides higher compressive strengths (up to 18% and 14% higher than QF and BF, respectively, in the first ages, and up to 13% and 22% higher than QF and BF, respectively, at 28 days), probably due to the better physical effect of this filler. In formulations with 20% of filler, LF and QF SLMs showed lower shrinkage when compared to BF SLMs (shrinkage 44% higher than LF mixture and 64% higher than QF mixture). It is concluded that the ideal content of filler to be used in SLMs must be between 10% and 20% of the mass of total solid and varies according to the filler. © 2021, IBRACON - Instituto Brasileiro do Concreto.

PI4.0 fruitfully participated to achieve the Circular Economy (CE) by speeding the reutilization, recovery, and recycling of scrap materials by minimizing cost, unproductive operations, energy consumption, emission of flue gases, etc. Recently, it has been ascertained that the identification and measurement of Research Trends (RTs) of CNs-ALs help the PI4.0 to build the future CE. In addressing the said research challenge, the objective of this research dossier is turned towards inculcating into future PI4.0 researchers the RTs of CNs/ALs of PI4.0, so that the researches can be organized over the very weak and moderately performing CNs-ALs to hike the future CE. To materialize the RTs of PI4-CNs/ALs, the authors conducted the Systematic Literature Survey (SLS) focusing on PI4.0-CNs/ALs, i.e., Internet of Things (IoTs), Cyber Physical System (CPS), Virtual Reality (VR), Integration (I), Data Optimization (DO), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Plant Control (PC), Data and Analytics (DA), Network (N), and Information and Data Management (IDM). The authors searched three hundred two research documents, wherein two hundred seventy-five research manuscripts qualified as RQ2. Next, the authors collected the DOIs/URLs corresponding to each CN-AL and explored the Sum of Digit Scoring System (SDSS) to summarize the DOIs/URLs of PI4.0-CNs/ALs. The RTs of DO have been determined as excellent and stronger over 2007-2017 than residue CNs/ALs. Eventually, the authors advised scholars to focus on the research areas of very weak and moderately weak performing CNs/ALs in order to attain future CE. © 2021 Yiqing Zhao et al.","","Embedded systems;

The purpose of this article is to assess the significance of previously reported barriers in the context of the machine-building industry. Design/methodology/approach: Adoption barriers are identified from the literature and formulated as hypotheses, which are verified with a set of focus group interviews consisting of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), AM service providers and quality inspection and insurance institutions. The results of the interviews are reported qualitatively, and the transcripts of the interviews are subjected to quantitative content analysis. Findings: The article identifies distrust in quality, insufficient material and design knowledge among stakeholders and poor availability of design documentation on spare parts as the key barriers of adopting AM in the production of spare parts. The three key barriers are interconnected and training engineers to be proficient in design and material issues as well as producing high-quality design documentation will yield the highest increase in AM implementation in spare parts. Originality/value: The article offers a unique approach as it investigates the subjective views of a cross-organizational group of industrial actors involved in the machine-building industry. The article contributes to the theory of digital spare parts by verifying and rejecting presented barriers of AM implementation and how they are interconnected. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","3D printing;

However, the demand for lifesaving organ transplants far exceeds the supply of available organs owing to organ shortage. To address this problem, tissue engineering has offered potential strategies for in vitro construction of organs as medical and clinical applications. However, tissue-engineered organs are difficult to construct owing to the lack of functional vascular networks because avascular organs lead to tissue dysfunctions, such as hypoxia and clot formation. Therefore, establishing functional vascular networks is required for the construction and maintenance of organs in terms of morphology and function. Recent advances in tissue engineering have allowed the in vitro construction of a wide range of functional vascular networks, ranging from microvessels to organ-scale vascular networks, using self-organization and pre-designed approaches. In particular, various new models have been developed utilizing microfluidics, 3D bioprinting, and organ decellularization. These models have enabled the in vitro recapitulation of key features of physiological vascular networks, such as morphology (e.g., network formation, luminal structure, and perivascular cell coverage) and function (e.g., barrier and antithrombogenic functions). In this review, we summarize the progress and challenges in vascular tissue engineering based on two distinct categories: self-organization and pre-designed approaches. In addition, the advantages and limitations of these models are highlighted, and future perspectives are discussed. These models will provide useful insights for the construction of vascularized functional tissues and organs and can contribute to development in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. © 2021 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.

The aim of the study was to identify the arch of feet based on the Arch Index (AI), ability to maintain balance on the basis of stabilometric parameters and the distribution of loads acting on the feet of professional folk dancers. Methods: The study group was composed of 37 folk dancers and the reference group consisted of 56 healthy adults aged 19–45. Balance measurements were performed using the Zebris FDM-S measurement platform, Romberg test with eyes open. Test results were exported to the Matlab 2019b computing environment. The algorithm developed by the Authors in relation was used to calculate Arch Index for the right and left foot, for each test participant separately. Results: Statistical tests did not reveal statistically relevant differences between stabilo-metric parameters and loads affecting feet in the reference group and that of the dancers. The statistical tests revealed that the value of the AI differed significantly in the reference group and in the group of professional folk dancers (p = 0.05). The differences were also observed in the group of females (p = 0.003). No statistically relevant differences were observed in relation to the group of males (p = 0.116). The percentage of the feet with high arch in the group of dancers amounted to 26%; 33% of dancers’ feet were classified as the feet with low arch. Conclusions: The feet of professional folk dancers have a statistically more arched foot than the reference group. © 2021, Institute of Machine Design and Operation.

However, skin lesion classification based on deep learning diagnostic techniques is a challenging task owing to the insufficiency of labeled skin lesion images and intraclass-imbalanced datasets. It is thus necessary to utilize data augmentation methods based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) to assist skin lesion classification and help dermatologists reach more accurate diagnostic decisions. Moreover, insufficient samples can cause a low classification accuracy in a model by using deep learning in medical diagnosis and reduce the accuracy of skin lesion classification. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a new skin lesion image classification framework based on a skin lesion augmentation style-based GAN (SLA-StyleGAN) according to the basic architecture of style-based GANs and DenseNet201. The proposed framework redesigns the structure of style control and noise input in the original generator and reconstructs the discriminator to adjust the generator to efficiently synthesize high-quality skin lesion images. We introduce a new loss function that reduces the intraclass sample distance and expands the sample distance between different classes, which can improve the balanced multiclass accuracy (BMA). The experimental results show that our classification framework performs well on the ISIC2019 dataset, and the BMA reaches 93.64%. The proposed method improves the accuracy of skin lesion image classification, assists dermatologists in determining and diagnosing different types of skin lesions, and analyzes skin lesions at different stages as well as those that are difficult to distinguish.  © 2013 IEEE.","convolutional neural networks; DenseNet; dermoscopy images; melanoma; skin lesion classification; StyleGAN","Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Deep learning; Dermatology; Image enhancement; Adversarial networks; Classification accuracy; Classification framework; Data augmentation; Diagnostic decisions; Diagnostic techniques; Imbalanced Data-sets; Skin lesion images; Image classification","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61701222)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61701222.","Feigelson H.S., Powers J.D., Kumar M., Carroll N.M., Pathy A., Ritzwoller D.P., Melanoma incidence, recurrence, and mortality in an integrated healthcare system: A retrospective cohort study, Cancer Med., 8, 9, pp. 4508-4516, (2019); Yang D.D., Salciccioli J.D., Marshall D.C., Sheri A., Shalhoub J., Trends in malignant melanoma mortality in 31 countries from 1985 to 2015-, Brit.

The simulation presented is motivated by electro-conductive polymer (ECP) materials processing in which multiple electromagnetic effects arise. The primitive boundary layer conservation equations are transformed into a non-similar system of coupled non-dimensional momentum, angular momentum, energy and concentration equations, with appropriate boundary conditions. The resulting two-point boundary value problem is solved numerically by an exceptionally stable and well-tested implicit finite difference technique. A stability analysis is included for restrictions of the implicit finite difference method (FDM) employed. Validation with a Galerkin finite element method (FEM) technique is included. The influence of various parameters is presented graphically on primary and secondary shear stress, Nusselt number, Sherwood number and wall couple stress. Secondary (cross flow) shear stress is strongly enhanced with greater magnetic parameter (Hartmann number) and micropolar wall couple stress is also weakly enhanced for small time values with Hartmann number. Increasing thermo-diffusive Soret number suppresses both Nusselt and Sherwood numbers whereas it elevates both primary and secondary shear stress and at larger time values also increases the couple stress. Secondary shear stress is strongly boosted with Hall parameter. Ion slip effect induces a weak modification in primary and secondary shear stress distributions.

This alloy has been widely used in pressure vessel components of thermal and nuclear power plants. The post-WAAM heat treatment process is critical to the anisotropy elimination and property improvement, which is designed and optimized with the help of the CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams)-based thermodynamic modeling in this work. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the as-built and post-heat-treated WAAM P91 steel are studied. The results show that the as-built P91 steel fabricated by WAAM has a much higher strength than traditional wrought material, with an ultra-fine and high-density dislocation embedded martensite lath and quantities of δ-ferrite. The heterogeneous structure resulting from the WAAM process is removed after homogenization at 1200°C for 2 h. The microstructure is optimized with the very fine martensite lath and rational prior austenite grain size (PAGS). The segregated MX observed in the matrix of the as-built material is dissolved back to the matrix during homogenization, which is beneficial to the dispersive precipitation of M23C6 and MX in the grain boundaries and matrix during the following aging. By optimizing homogenization (1200°C for 2 h) and aging (760°C for 2 h) heat treatments, the WAAM P91 steel demonstrates excellent mechanical properties with the ultimate tensile strength of 774 MPa, yield strength of 686 MPa and ductility of 19.4%, which far surpasses the mechanical properties of standard wrought P91 steel used in the industry. The strengthening mechanism is elucidated to be the synergistic effect of MX and M23C6 precipitation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Grade 91; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Post-heat treatment; Wire-arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Austenite; Grain boundaries; Heat treatment; Martensite; Microstructure; Nuclear fuels; Tensile strength; Calculation of phase diagrams; Heat treatment process; Heterogeneous structures; Microstructure and mechanical properties; Prior austenite grain size; Property improvement; Strengthening mechanisms; Ultimate tensile strength; Nuclear power plants","","","","","United States Government; National Energy Technology Laboratory, NETL, (DE‐FE0031637); National Energy Technology Laboratory, NETL","Funding text 1: The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Energy Technology Laboratory , United States, under the award number DE‐FE0031637 . ; Funding text 2: The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Energy Technology Laboratory, United States, under the award number DE‐FE0031637.

For example, the noise emitted through industrial activities and transportation networks such as road, rail and air traffic. In Malaysia, most of the schools located very close to the roadside and near busy places such as cities, shops, and residential areas. This study aims to analyze the environmental noise in terms of spatial and temporal analysis in two primary schools in Terengganu State. The noise monitoring had conducted in two (2) primary schools with different land use; residential area (Batu Rakit Primary School) and commercial area (Paya Bunga Primary School) on the school and non-school days by using Sound Level Meter (SLM). The spatial mapping had constructed by using SketchUp® 2018 and Surfer® version 11 software. The noise level between both study areas was significantly different based on a p-value of less than 0.05. It also surpassed the Department of Environment (DOE) of Malaysia's permitted limit, with the Equivalent Noise Level (LAeq) in residential areas being greater than in commercial areas due to traffic volume and noise from nearby activities. Lastly, the area near the roadside has higher critical noise pollution compared with the location that furthers from the roadside. In conclusion, this study is useful in creating awareness to the public about the noise pollution effect on primary school students and is also can be used for mitigation measures to have a better place for students to study. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office","commercial; Noise pollution; residential; school; sound level meter; traffic volume","","","","","","Air Quality and Noise Laboratory; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (RACER/1/2019/TK10/UMT//1)","This study is funded by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme for Research Acculturation of Early Career Researchers by the Malaysian Ministry of Education (RACER/1/2019/TK10/UMT//1).

The mathematical model is based on continuity and enthalpy conservation equations. The core of the model is a source term of continuity which governs the rate of phase change. The formulation of the source term is originally proposed with an infinite series, i.e. an iterative rate-tuner, which accounts for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase changes. As the model tracks equilibrium transitions by the stand-alone rate-tuner, off-equilibrium paths are described by regulations of the rate-tuner. The model also resolves undercooling-superheating of phase change materials with a feature tackling nucleation-growth-transition using an interphase-detector-function. In order to evaluate the model, a computational program was developed from the equations discretized with finite volume method. The paper presents implementation of the code in three test problems; Test-case-I employs a typical Stefan problem, i.e. melting of an ice bar in equilibrium condition, which verifies the model with the exact solution. Test-case-II simulates the ice bar under periodic heating/cooling at its end, so that non-equilibrium melting/freezing arises at the end of the bar. Depths and fractions of the phase change are graphed versus the frequency of heating/cooling cycles and the rate-regulator parameter. A spectrum of kinetic behaviors is presented, depending on the rate-regulator parameter. Three kinetic behaviors are distinguished, namely; extremely fast (instantaneous equilibrium), intermediate (non-equilibrium) and extremely slow (bypassed, highly-restricted-rate). Finally, test-case-III deals with a non-equilibrium solidification in a real case (sodium-acetate-trihydrate) that exhibits undercooling and recalescence due to nucleation-growth kinetics. The model successfully predicted temperature history curves in comparison with experimental data. The model is a step toward enhancing our computational tools for non-equilibrium phase changes in advanced material processing like additive manufacturing, casting, welding, solidification and energy storage systems. © 2020","Enthalpy method; Heat transfer; Kinetics; Modelling; Phase change; Solidification","3D printers; Crystallization; Digital storage; Energy storage; Finite volume method; Growth kinetics; Ice problems; Iterative methods; Kinetics; Melting; Nucleation; Sodium compounds; Solidification; Tuners; Undercooling; Conservation equations; Energy storage systems; Equilibrium conditions; Equilibrium transitions; Non-equilibrium phase; Non-equilibrium solidification; Nucleation-growth kinetics; Sodium acetate trihydrate; Phase change materials","","","","","","","Sha W.T., Chao B.T., Soo S.L., Porous-media formulation for multiphase flow with heat transfer, Nucl.

A part in a buffer typically needs to be scrapped or reworked if its residence time exceeds the maximum allowable residence time, while a part needs to keep waiting in the buffer if its residence time is less than the minimum required residence time. Such limits could be required at multiple stages of the production line, making it difficult to analyze both the steady-state and transient production system performance. The problem under study is formulated as a multistage geometric serial production line with residence time limits. To deal with its large state space, a two-machine-one-buffer subsystem isolated from a multistage geometric serial production line is first analyzed for both steady-state and transient performance. Furthermore, a novel aggregation method, including the steady-state analysis and transient analysis, is proposed to evaluate the overall system performance. The proposed aggregation method substantially reduces the complexity of the problem and makes the analysis of the problem tractable. Compared with the simulation, the aggregation method maintains high accuracy in estimating both steady-state and transient performance measures. Such a method provides quantitative tools for effective performance evaluation and prediction on the factory floor. Note to Practitioners - It is well known that potential quality problems may occur and production cost may increase if the residence time of intermediate products is left uncontrolled. The residence time limits become a concern, especially in the automotive industry, food industry, and semiconductor industry, where intermediate products stay in a stage susceptible to defects. The limits also apply to large scale additive manufacturing of thermoplastic polymers. The deposition of each layer is subject to lower and upper bounds of surface temperature, which, in practice, are equivalent to minimum required residence time limit and maximum allowable residence time limit, respectively. With residence time considered, the size of state space for the overall production system model will grow exponentially, as the system's size increases, which brings tremendous challenges to evaluate such a system both in the short term and in the long run. In this article, we introduce a novel modeling approach for a multistage geometric serial production line with residence time limits and propose a method that drastically reduces the complexity of the system. Such a method provides a quantitative tool to effectively evaluate the performance of multistage geometric lines with residence time limits.  © 2020 IEEE.","Aggregation method; multistage production lines; residence time; transient analysis","3D printers; Geometry; Semiconductor device manufacture; Effective performance; Lower and upper bounds; Multi-stage productions; Semiconductor industry; Serial production line; Steady state and transients; Steady-state analysis; Thermoplastic polymer; Transient analysis","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1829238, CMMI-1829238); National Science Foundation, NSF","This work was supported by NSF under Grant CMMI-1829238.","Li Y., Chu F., Yang Z., Calvo R.W., A production inventory routing planning for perishable food with quality consideration, IFACPapersOnLine, 49, 3, pp. 407-412, (2016); Wang J., Hu Y., Li J., Transient analysis to design buffer capacity in dairy filling and packing production lines, J.

However, for some users, foam is not the best material as it acts as a thermal insulator and it may not offer adequate postural support. The additive manufacturing of such surfaces and equipment may alleviate these issues, but material and design investigation is needed to optimize the printing parameters for use in pressure relief applications. This study aims to assess the ability of an additive manufactured flexible polymer to perform similarly to a viscoelastic foam for use in comfort applications. Design/methodology/approach: Three-dimensional (3D) printed samples of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) are tested in uniaxial compression with four different infill patterns and varying infill percentage. The behaviours of the samples are compared to a viscoelastic polyurethane foam used in various comfort applications. Findings: Results indicate that TPU experiences an increase in strength with an increasing infill percentage. Findings from the study suggest that infill pattern impacts the compressive response of 3D printed material, with two-dimensional patterns inducing an elasto-plastic buckling of the cell walls in TPU depending on infill percentage. Such buckling may not be a beneficial property for comfort applications. Based on the results, the authors suggest printing from TPU with a low-density 3D infill, such as 5% gyroid. Originality/value: Several common infill patterns are characterised in compression in this work, suggesting the importance of infill choices when 3D printing end-use products and design for manufacturing. © 2021, Susan Erica Nace, John Tiernan and Donal Holland Aisling Ni Annaidh.","3D printing; Compression loading; Infill patterns; Stress (materials); Thermoplastic polymers","Additives; Buckling; Design for manufacturability; Infill drilling; Polyurethanes; Product design; Reinforced plastics; Viscoelasticity; Compression characteristics; Compressive response; Design for Manufacturing; Design/methodology/approach; Thermoplastic polyurethanes; Threedimensional (3-d); Two-dimensional patterns; Uni-axial compression; 3D printers","","","","","University College Dublin’s School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering; ; University College Dublin?s School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering; Irish Research Council, (EBP/2017/498); Irish Research Council","Funding text 1: This work has been funded by the Irish Research Council and Enable Ireland through the Employment Based Postgraduate Programme (grant number EBP/2017/498) and University College Dublin\u2019s School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering. ; Funding text 2: This work has been funded by the Irish Research Council and Enable Ireland through the Employment Based Postgraduate Programme (grant number EBP/2017/498) and University College Dublin?s School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering.

Based on the idea of Goodman element, the elastic-plastic constitutive model of the shear cracks is derived, and the elastic-plastic analysis of shear crack propagation is realized in the local radial basis point interpolation method (LRPIM). This method avoids the loss of accuracy caused by the mesh in the analysis of fracture propagation, and the crack propagation of rock brittle material is simulated. The investigation indicates that (1) the LRPIM results are close to the FDM results, which demonstrates that it is feasible to analyze shear cracks in rock masses. (2) Compared with the results of the built-in oblique crack model, when the LRPIM is used to analyze crack propagation, the results are close to the experimental results, showing that the LRPIM can model shear crack propagation in a rock mass. (3) The propagation path using the LRPIM is not sufficiently smooth, which can be explained as the crack tip stress and strain not being sufficiently accurate and still requiring further improvement.

The behavior of thermal radiation and chemical reactions are also contemplated. The governing partial differential equations are reformed to ordinary differential equations by operating similarity transformations. The numerical outcomes for the arising non-linear boundary value problem are determined by implementing the Successive linearization method (SLM) via Matlab software. The velocity, temperature, and concentration magnitudes for distant values of the governing parametric quantities are conferred, and their conduct is debated via graphical curves. The surface drag coefficient increases, whereas the local Nusselt number and Sherwood number decreases for enhancing unsteadiness parameter across suction parameter. Moreover, the magnetic and suction parameters accelerate velocity magnitudes while by raising porosity parameter, velocity decelerates. Larger numeric of thermal radiation parameter and Eckert number accelerates the temperature profile while by enhancing Prandtl number it decelerates. Schmidt number and chemical reaction parameters slowdowns the concentration distribution, and the chemical reaction parameter influences on the point of chemical reaction that benefits the interface mass transfer. It is expected that the current achieved results will furnish fruitful knowledge in industrious utilities.  © 2021 - IOS Press.

They have the advantages of small size, high consistency, ability for high volume production, and excellent possibility to be integrated with electronics circuits. Optical waveguide couplers are mainly utilized as power dividers, optical switches, and wavelength division multiplexers/de-multiplexers (WDM). A number of methods have been used to analyze directional couplers, such as coupled mode theory (CMT), the beam propagation method (BPM), the method of lines (MoL), finite-difference methods (FDM) and finite element methods (FEM). Among these numerical approaches, MoL is the simplest method to analyze mode propagation inside directional couplers because it has the advantages of very fast convergence and accurate solutions for one-dimensional structures. The objective of this study was to analyze the propagation of TE modes in optical directional couplers by using MoL. The parameters used, i.e. waveguide width, refractive index and wavelength, were taken from the characteristics of silica-on-silicon directional couplers that were used in fabrication. MoL is considered a special finite-difference method, which discretizes a one-or two-dimensional wave equation in the transverse direction and uses an analytical solution for the propagation directions. Basically, MoL is a semi analytical numerical method with the advantages of numerical stability, computational efficiency and calculation time reduction. Further, we explored the possibility of using directional couplers as optical switching devices. © 2021 Published by ITB Institute for Research and Community Services.","Absorbing boundary condition, optical directional couplers; Method of lines; Optical switch; Planar light wave circuits","Beam propagation method; Computation theory; Computational efficiency; Convergence of numerical methods; Directional couplers; Finite difference method; Nonlinear optics; One dimensional; Optical waveguides; Photonic devices; Refractive index; Silica; Timing circuits; Absorbing boundary condition; Absorbing boundary condition, optical directional coupler; Finite-difference methods; Light-wave circuit technology; Line analysis; Method of lines; Mode propagation; Optical directional couplers; Planar lightwave circuit; TE mode; Optical switches","","","","","","","Kumar S., Deen M.J., Fiber Optic Communications, Fundamental and Applications, (2014); Chrostowski L., Hochberg M., Silicon Photonics Design, (2015); Yariv A., Yeh P., Photonics, Optical Electronics in Modern Communications, (2017); Liu J.M., Photonic Devices, (2005); Rogers A., Essentials of Photonics, (2008); Al-Azzawi A., Advanced Manufacturing for Optical Fibers and Integrated Photonic Devices, (2016); Shitrit N., Shteeman V., Hardy A.A., Reformulation of Coupled-Mode Theory of Parallel Waveguides for Analysis of Arbitrary Beams, 2018 IEEE International Conference on the Science of Electrical Engineering in Israel (ICSEE), (2018); Syahriar A., Adam H., Astharini D., Lubis A.H., Gandana D.M., Analysis of Three Paralel Waveguides Using Coupled Mode Theory and the Method of Lines, International Seminar on Application for Technology of Information and Communication (ISemantic), (2016); Wei J.S., Power Transfer in a Large Parallel Array of Coupled Dielectric Waveguides, IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques, 55, pp. 2345-2353, (2007); Kaplan A., Ruschin S., Optical Switching and Power Control in LiNbO3 Coupled Waveguide Arrays, IEEE J.

As specific objective, it sought to provide information on the effects of the electrode-positive/electrode-negative (EP/EN) parameter in the CMT advanced process fundamental characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: Initially, bead-on-plate deposits were produced with different EP/EN ratios, still keeping the same deposition rate, and the outcomes on the electrical signal traces and bead formation were analyzed. In a second stage, the EP/EN parameter and the layer edge to water distance (LEWD) parameter from the NIAC technique were systematically varied and the resultant macro and microstructures compared with those formed by applying natural cooling. Findings: Constraints of EP/EN setting range were uncovered and discussed. The use of the NIAC technique favors the formation of finer grains. For a given EP/EN value, a variation in the NIAC intensity (LEWD value) showed marginal effect on grain size. When the EP/EN parameter effect is isolated, i.e. for a given LEWD setting, it was observed that an increase in the EP/EN level favors coarser grains. Originality/value: Both the EP/EN parameter and the use of an active cooling technique (NIAC) might be used, even in combination, as effective tools for achieving proper macro and microstructure in WAAM of thin wall builds. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Active cooling; Aluminum; CMT advanced; Microstructure; Variable polarity; WAAM","3D printers; Aluminum; Deposition rates; Microstructure; Walls (structural partitions); Advanced process; Cold metal transfers; Design/methodology/approach; Electrical signal; Macro- and microstructure; Management techniques; Microstructural aspects; Parameter effects; Cooling","","","","","LAPROSOLDA-UFU; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES, (88887.373591/2019-00); Universidade Federal de Uberlândia, UFU; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (157715/2019-1, 302863/2016-8, 315092/2018-1); Petrobras, (23117.018175/2019-80)","The authors would like to thank the Center for Research and Development of Welding Processes of the Federal University of Uberlandia (LAPROSOLDA-UFU) for the laboratory infrastructure and technical support.

We then discuss in detail the (non-)Abelian T-dualization of Gödel string cosmologies via the Poisson–Lie (PL) T-duality approach. In studying Abelian T-duality of the models we get seven dual models in such a way that they are constructed by one-, two- and three-dimensional Abelian Lie groups acting freely on the target space manifold. The results of our study show that the Abelian T-dual models are, under some of the special conditions, self-dual; moreover, by applying the usual rules of Abelian T-duality without further corrections, we are still able to obtain two-loop solutions. We also study the Abelian T-duality of Gödel string cosmologies up to α′-corrections by using the T-duality rules at two-loop order derived by Kaloper and Meissner. Afterwards, non-Abelian duals of the Gödel spacetimes are constructed by two- and three-dimensional non-Abelian Lie groups such as A2, A2⊕ A1 and SL(2 , R). In this way, the PL self-duality of AdS3× R space is discussed. © 2021, The Author(s).","","","","","","","Azarbaijan Shahid Madani University, (97/231)","This work has been supported by the research vice chancellor of Azarbaijan Shahid Madani University under research fund No. 97/231.

The performance of the models has been evaluated by numerical analysis considering the uncertainty of input parameters. Computer-Aided design was used to develop the models of three designs according to the patient's anatomy and to achieve to near symmetry of the mandible. Stress-strength modeling was utilized for the probabilistic physics of failure analysis under assumption of a quasi-static load. Monte-Carlo simulation was also applied for probabilistic finite element analysis and reliability assessment. The sensitivity analysis of the models was developed to reflect the significance of the variables in the models. The deterministic stress analysis shows that the highest stress and the second maximum stress are 110 MPa and 85 MPa for cortical bone around the screws, respectively. Also, it is determined that the maximum plate stress of the titanium conventional plate model is 580 MPa. The reconstruction system success rate was improved in all models by observing the anatomy of the patient's mandible in the plate designs by computer-aided design and additive manufacturing techniques. Based on the results, the reliability of plate strength and pull-out screws strength are 99.99% and 96.71% for the fibula free flap model, respectively, and 99.99% and 94.17%, respectively, for the customized prosthesis model. Probability sensitivity factors showed that uncertainty in the elastic modulus of the cortical bone has the greatest effect on the probability of screws loosening. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Mandibular reconstruction system; probabilistic finite element method; reliability assessment","Biomechanical Phenomena; Bone Plates; Bone Screws; Computer Simulation; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Mandible; Mandibular Reconstruction; Reproducibility of Results; Stress, Mechanical; Bone; Computer aided design; Finite element method; Intelligent systems; Medical computing; Monte Carlo methods; Screws; Sensitivity analysis; Stress analysis; Uncertainty analysis; titanium; Computer-aided design; Cortical bone; Mandibular reconstruction; Mandibular reconstruction system; Probabilistic finite-element methods; Reconstruction systems; Reliability assessments; System reliability; Target reliability; Uncertainty; Article; biomechanics; computer aided design; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; cortical bone; device failure analysis; digital imaging and communications in medicine; finite element analysis; free tissue graft; mandible reconstruction; mastication; Monte Carlo method; probabilistic reasoning; reliability; screw loosening; sensitivity analysis; shear stress; stereolithography; tensile strength; three dimensional printing; Young modulus; bone plate; bone screw; computer simulation; finite element analysis; human; mandible; mechanical stress; reproducibility; surgery; Reliability analysis","","titanium, 7440-32-6","","","cancer research center of cancer institute of Iran, (37603-202-01-97); Sahand University of Technology, SUT","This project has been conducted by a grant from cancer research center of cancer institute of Iran (Sohrabi cancer charity, Grant No: 37603-202-01-97).

In NFV, a network service is implemented as a chain of network functions (NFs). NFs are virtualized and packaged into virtual network functions (VNF), so that they can be decoupled from the physical middleboxes and dynamically deployed on standard virtualization platforms in cloud or datacenters. Therefore, NFV has the potential to provide significant cost reductions in operating expenses (OPEX) and capital expenses (CAPEX) and increased agility for network service deployments. However, to build and manage a network function virtualization infrastructure (NFVI) is challenging. One of the key problems is to determine the mapping between underlying physical resources and VNFs in order to minimize energy consumption without violating service-level agreements (SLA). Many previous studies use embedding solutions to solve the problem by only considering the resource demand of NS and the resource capacity of physical network at a given time instance. But in practice, the resource demands of NS can vary over time, hence the embedding decision must be reconfigured accordingly. Many techniques can be used for reconfiguration, including resource scaling, instance migration and traffic re-direction. But each of these operation is associated with some costs, such as service interruptions, and additional resource or energy consumption. In this work, we investigate various reconfiguration strategies, formulate their costs by designing a model in the NFV placement problem, and propose Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and heuristic solutions, called REAP. In our evaluation, we observed 60% and 25% cost reduction for energy and reconfiguration costs, and we analyze the cost reduction from each of the reconfiguration methods to validate the design of our heuristic algorithm.  © 2013 IEEE.","Network function virtualization; optimization; resource management; scheduling","Cost reduction; Embeddings; Energy utilization; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Inductive logic programming (ILP); Integer programming; Telecommunication services; Transfer functions; Heuristic solutions; Instance migrations; Integer Linear Programming; Physical resources; Placement problems; Reconfiguration costs; Service interruption; Service Level Agreements; Network function virtualization","","","","","","","Song Z., Zhang X., Eriksson C., Data center energy and cost saving evaluation, Energy Procedia, 75, pp. 1255-1260, (2015); Jin Y., Wen Y., Chen Q., Energy efficiency and server virtualization in data centers: An empirical investigation, Proc.

The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) specifies the sidelink (SL) transmission based on New Radio (NR), aiming to meet stringent vehicle-to-everything (V2X) requirements. Compared with Long Term Evolution (LTE) V2X, which only supports broadcast use cases, NR V2X also supports unicast and groupcast. The groupcast operation allows the transmitter to communicate with multiple receivers in the same group at once. In general, the group size for vehicles is limited due to the high-reliability requirement. In this paper, we present reliable blind retransmission for NR V2X groupcast. We improve the groupcast transmission reliability by assigning the proper retransmission user equipment(UE). This paper proposes a retransmission UE assignment. We formulate a retransmission UE selection problem to maximize the group packet reception ratio (GPRR) for NR V2X distributed groupcast. The simulation results show that the proposed retransmission method improves the V2X groupcast in terms of GPRR, packet inter-reception time (PIR), and the available group size.  © 2013 IEEE.","groupcast; new radio; resource allocation; V2X","Long Term Evolution (LTE); Radio transmission; Reliability; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Vehicle transmissions; Autonomous Vehicles; Group size; Groupcast; High reliability; New radio; Packet reception ratios; Resources allocation; Retransmissions; User equipments; V2X; Vehicle to Everything","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (108-2221-E-002-033-MY3, 109-2221-E-002-148-MY2); National Taiwan University, NTU, (NTUCC-109L892506)","The work of Hung-Yu Wei was supported in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan under Grant 108-2221-E-002-033-MY3 and Grant 109-2221-E-002-148-MY2, and in part by the National Taiwan University under Grant NTUCC-109L892506.","Shih M.-J., Liu H.-H., Shen W.-D., Wei H.-Y., UE autonomous resource selection for D2D communications: Explicit vs. implicit approaches, Proc.

In the present paper, a form finding for a cement based tessellated pierced vault is studied. The multi-body rope approach (MRA) was used to define compression-only vault optimal shapes. Successively, the thrust network analysis (TNA) was implemented by Rhino-vault for a further validation of the shape and the definition of different tessellation meshes of the surfaces, according to different hole pattern configuration. Different piercing percentage of the vaults were considered and compared for the best solution identification. In addition, the geometrical solutions were analyzed by means of global stability analysis, taking into account the different positions of the holes. Furthermore, 3D printing with a Fuse Deposition Modeling (FDM) technique in polylactide (PLA) material (completely eco-friendly) is used for the construction of the formworks of the cement based blocks (dowels) useful for the assembly of a vault scaled prototype. The prototype of the vault, characterized by a certain piercing percentage was subjected to different loading conditions and monitored by a non-contact device based on the Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique. The 3D-DIC was performed to recognize the structural behavior during the loading process of the model (prototype). DIC measurements were used to recognize in advance the critical condition of the vault under loading and the displacement measurements were correlated to the different loading phases up to the collapse condition. © 2021 A.

This structuring brings about unusual material behaviour that is not seen in a continuum material. Here we introduce a multiscale design for the matrix components of a lead-free piezocomposite. This combines a microscale stiff polymeric structure embedded within a softer matrix to form a composite matrix. By controlling the microscale features of the embedded structure, we tune the mechanical behaviour of the matrix by rendering it either nonauxetic (hexagonal structure) or auxetic (inverted hexagonal structure). Further, the mechanical and electrical properties of the matrix are controlled at the nanoscale by addition of carbon nanotubes within the embedded polymeric structure. By engineering the matrix at the nano and the microscale, we firstly demonstrate that the auxetic matrix can result in three orders of magnitude higher piezoelectric response by amplifying the strains within the piezoelectric inclusions. We further demonstrate that by using the matrix with the nonauxetic embedded structure, it is possible to design piezoelectric composites with pronounced anisotropy in their longitudinal and transverse responses. This is an important requirement for designing materials with directional sensing ability. Our findings show that the multiscale material design proposed here has important implications for both energy harvesting and directional sensing. Further, the approach taken here yields considerable performance improvements while using limited quantities of nanomaterial. The multiscale matrix design is scalable and amenable to fabrication through emerging methods such as additive manufacturing. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","","3D printers; Anisotropy; Energy harvesting; Piezoelectricity; Mechanical and electrical properties; Mechanical behaviour; Multiscale material designs; Piezoelectric composite; Piezoelectric inclusions; Piezoelectric response; Polymeric structures; Three orders of magnitude; Polymer matrix composites","","","","","; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (RTI2018-094945-B-C21, DPI2017-89162-R)","This work was supported by the Ministerio de Econom\u00EDa y Competitividad of Spain and the European Regional Development Fund under projects RTI2018-094945-B-C21 and DPI2017-89162-R.

Thus, modulating the energy release to achieve efficiency and effectiveness for desired applications is of great value. Investigation of nanomaterials as energetic materials began more than twenty years ago with much of the interest to increase reaction rates and reduce sensitivity. During this period, research on energetic nanoparticles was devoted to reducing the loss of energy density with metallic materials due to the naturally occurring oxide passivating layer, managing their high surface area preventing high loadings in solids, minimizing particle-particle interactions making dispersion in the gas-phase difficult, and understanding combustion mechanisms. As an outcome, novel synthesis methods of producing nanocomposites, and new fields of applications, such as micro-pyrotechnics, have developed. Yet, the research community is only beginning to understand how to manipulate and build energetic materials at the nanoscale, and what designs are optimal for desired functions. Furthermore, recognizing the difficulties for increased energy density and reduced sensitivity, the development of multifunctional and smart nanoenergetic materials is currently being researched to enable control of energy release rates and material sensitivity on demand. This research is being advanced by assembly of nanoengineered energetic materials to bulk scales by additive manufacturing, the development and application of combustion diagnostics that resolve nanometer and micron scales, and ab initio quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics calculations. The challenges that have been confronted and the directions of continuing research on nanoenergetics are presented and discussed. © 2020 The Combustion Institute.","Additive manufacturing; Combustion; Composite particles; Nanotechnology; Propellants","Additives; Bond strength (chemical); Calculations; Combustion; Industrial research; Molecular dynamics; Nanostructured materials; Potential energy; Quantum chemistry; Reaction rates; Bond energies; Composite particles; Energetic nanoparticles; Energy density; Energy performance; Energy release; Loss of energy; Metallic material; Reactions rates; Thermodynamic performance; 3D printers","","","","","Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR; Army Research Office, ARO, (FA9550-13-1-0004, FA9550-19-1-0008, W911NF-04-1-0178); Army Research Office, ARO","R.A.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on the classical laminated plate theory, a dynamic model is established using the orthogonal polynomials method, taking into account the effect of lamination and orthogonal anisotropy. The dynamic inherent characteristics of the ME plate are worked out by Ritz method. The frequency-domain dynamic equations are then derived to solve the plates’ resonant responses, with which the damping ratio is figured out according to the half-power bandwidth method. Subsequently, a series of experimental tests are performed on the ME samples to obtain the measured data. Findings: It is shown that the predictions and measurements in terms of dynamic behavior are in good agreement, validating the accuracy of the developed model. In addition, sensitivity analysis shows that increasing the elastic modulus or Poisson’s ratio will increase the corresponding natural frequency of the ME plate but decrease the resonant response. When the density is increased, both the natural frequency and resonant response will be decreased. Research limitations/implications: Future research can be focused on using the proposed model to investigate the effect of processing parameters on the ME parts’ dynamic behavior. Practical implications: This study shows theoretical basis and technical insight into improving the forming quality and reliability of the ME parts. Originality/value: A novel reliable dynamic model is set up to provide theoretical basis and principle to reveal the physical phenomena and mechanism of ME parts. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Dynamic model;

However, biofabrication schemes requiring electrostimulation pose an additional constraint due to the insulating properties of natural materials. Here, we propose a methacryloyl-modified decellularized small intestine submucosa (SISMA) hydrogel, embedded with graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets, for extrusion-based 3D bioprinting applications that require electrostimulation. Methacryloyl biochemical modification is performed to enhance the mechanical stability of dECM constructs by mediating photo-crosslinking reactions, and a multistep fabrication scheme is proposed to harness the bioactive and hydrophilic properties of GO and electroconductive properties of reduced GO. For this, GO was initially dispersed in SISMA hydrogels by exploiting its hydrophilicity and protein adsorption capabilities, and in situ reduction was subsequently performed to confer electroconductive abilities. SISMA-GO composite hydrogels were successfully prepared with enhanced structural characteristics, as shown by the higher crosslinking degree and increased elastic response upon blue-light exposure. Moreover, GO was homogeneously dispersed without affecting photocrosslinking reactions and hydrogel shear-thinning properties. Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells were successfully bioprinted in SISMA-GO with high cell viability after 1 week and in situ reduction of GO during this period enhanced the electrical conductivity of these nanostructures. This work demonstrates the potential of SISMA-GO bioinks as bioactive and electroconductive scaffolds for electrostimulation applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. © 2021 Rueda-Gensini L, et al.
