To evaluate these properties for hard to reach and confined areas of the human body, miniature force sensors with size constraints and appropriate load capabilities are needed. This research article reports on the design, fabrication, integration, characterization, and in vivo experimentation of a uniaxial miniature force sensor on a human forearm. Methods: The strain gauge based sensor components were designed to meet dimensional constraints (diameter ≤3.5mm), safety factor (≥3) and performance specifications (maximum applied load, resolution, sensitivity, and accuracy). The sensing element was fabricated using traditional machining. Inverted vat photopolymerization technology was used to prototype complex components on a Form3 printer; micro-component orientation for fabrication challenges were overcome through experimentation. The sensor performance was characterized using dead weights and a LabVIEW based custom developed data acquisition system. The operational performance was evaluated by in vivo measurements on a human forearm; the relaxation data were used to calculate the Voigt model viscoelastic coefficient. Results: The three dimensional (3D) printed components exhibited good dimensional accuracy (maximum deviation of 183μm). The assembled sensor exhibited linear behavior (regression coefficient of R2=0.999) and met desired performance specifications of 3.4 safety factor, 1.2N load capacity, 18mN resolution, and 3.13% accuracy. The in vivo experimentally obtained relaxation data were analyzed using the Voigt model yielding a viscoelastic coefficient τ=12.38sec and a curve-fit regression coefficient of R2=0.992. Conclusions: This research presented the successful design, use of 3D printing for component fabrication, integration, characterization, and analysis of initial in vivo collected measurements with excellent performance for a miniature force sensor for the assessment of tissue viscoelastic properties. Through this research certain limitations were identified, however the initial sensor performance was promising and encouraging to continue the work to improve the sensor. This micro-force sensor could be used to obtain tissue quantitative data to assess tissue healthiness for medical care over extended time periods. © 2021, The Author(s).","3D printing; Design; Human confined space; In vivo measurements; Micro-force sensor; Sensor performance characterization; Tissue evaluation","3D printers; Data acquisition; Fabrication; Safety factor; Specifications; Strain gages; Viscoelasticity; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Confined space; Human confined space; In-vivo measurement; Micro-force sensors; Performance characterization; Sensor performance; Sensor performance characterization; Tissue evaluation; Article; biomechanics; bladder tissue; clinical evaluation; data analysis software; experimentation; forearm; fused deposition modeling; human; human tissue; in vivo study; information processing; inverted vat photopolymerization; layer laminate manufacturing; medical care; microtechnology; pelvic viscera; polymerization; powder; powder binding bonding; product design; product development; relaxation time; safety procedure; selective laser sintering; stereolithography; three dimensional printing; viscoelasticity; Tissue","","","","","Aerospace Engineering Department","The authors would like to thank Mr. Rex Winfrey and Mr. Kermit Baird with prototyping and fabrication assistance, and Mr. Michael Baker for data acquisition setup assistance all at the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department.

This article presents the mechanical and morphological properties of poly(lactic) acid specimens using the laminated object manufacturing technique. The effect was experimentally investigated on 3D-printed discs joined together to make a laminated test specimen. The specimen was prepared and tested under different infill patterns, viz. linear, triangular, and honeycomb structure, 50–90% infill density, and under varying disc thickness ranging from 3.4–5.6 mm. The maximum compressive strength of 42.47 MPa was attained for the laminated specimen with 70% infill, honeycomb pattern, and disc thickness of 3.4 mm (six discs), whereas the linear infill pattern has shown the least compressive performance of 22.40 MPa. The result of the study suggested that the honeycomb infill pattern with 90% infill density and six discs provides the optimum set of parameters for the 3D printing of PLA samples for maximization of compressive strength, especially for laminated object manufactured specimens. The Taguchi L9 orthogonal analysis (OA) suggested a significant influence on the infill pattern and the number of discs, contributing 51.60% and 48.29%, respectively, towards the compressive strength. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and toolmaker microscopic images have supported the observed experimental mechanical results for the laminated object manufactured specimens. The used technique of laminated object-manufactured components in the current study may have effective usage in marine and structural engineering fields. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing in marine application; compressive strength; laminated object manufacturing; poly(lactic)acid; surface roughness; Taguchi analysis","","","","","","Ministerstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy, MŠMT; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, UTM, (Q.J130000.3851.19J93, Q.J130000.21A6.00P39); Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, UTM; OPII, (VA/DP/2021/9.3-01); UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (103608); UK Research and Innovation, UKRI; Minister of Transport and Construction of the Slovak Republic, (NFP313010BXF3); European Commission, EC, (CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_025/0007293); European Commission, EC","The authors are grateful to CT University for continuous financial, moral, and technical support.

Besides heat treatments, laser shock peening (LSP) is a promising technology for tailoring residual stress profiles of additively manufactured components. A multi step process simulation is applied aiming at predicting the residual stress state after applying LSP to a cuboid shaped specimen manufactured by LPBF in two different building directions as well as comparing it with a post-build heat treatment. The validity of the numerical simulation is evaluated based on comparisons of residual stresses determined by incremental hole drilling technique within different stages of the multi step process: in the as-build condition, after subsequent heat treatment as well as after applying LSP to the as-build and heat treated specimens, showing overall a good experimental–numerical agreement throughout each of the process stages. Applying a heat treatment to the as-build LPBF sample at 700 °C for 6 h showed not to be effective in eliminating the surface tensile stress entirely, reducing the tensile residual stresses by 40%. However, the application of LSP on LPBF components showed promising results: LSP was able even to convert the detrimental near surface tensile residual stresses in the LPBF component into compressive residual stresses next to the surface, which is known to be beneficial for the fatigue performance. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; Finite element analysis; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser shock peening; LPBF 316L stainless steel; Residual stress","3D printers; Additives; Austenitic stainless steel; Finite element method; Heat treatment; Infill drilling; 316 L stainless steel; Finite element analyse; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powder bed fusion 316l stainless steel; Laser powders; Laser shock peening; Powder bed; Tensile residual stress; Residual stresses","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (459713992); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG","BK and NK acknowledge the funding by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) - project number 459713992 .","Li C., Liu J., Guo Y., Prediction of residual stress and part distortion in selective laser melting, Proc.

The research on laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) of Al-Zn-Mg alloy is slow due to the hot crack problem caused by wide solidification range. In this paper, the effect of Zr on the defects, microstructure and properties of the LPBF of Al-3.6Zn-0.6Mg alloy was studied. It is found that the introduction of 0.5 wt% Zr into the Al-3.6Zn-0.6Mg powder could reduce the defect density by lowering the thermal conductivity and refining grains of the alloy. 0.5 wt% Zr refined the grains from 8.6 μm to 3.36 μm and improved the tensile performances of the LPBF of Al-3.6Zn-0.6Mg alloy by promoting nucleation of equiaxed grains. The morphology of the grain changed from columnar grain to the mixture of columnar grain and equiaxed grain. Tensile strength of the LPBF of Al-3.6Zn-0.6Mg alloy increased by 21.7 % and the yield strength increased by 22.2 % after the introduction of 0.5 wt% Zr. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Al-Zn-Mg alloy; Laser powder bed fusion; Microstructure and mechanical properties","Aluminum alloys; Defects; High strength alloys; Magnesium alloys; Morphology; Tensile strength; Ternary alloys; Textures; Zircaloy; Zirconium; Columnar grain; Defect microstructure; Equi-axed grains; High-strength; Hot cracks; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Powder bed; Properties of Al; Zinc alloys","","","","","Analytical and Testing Center of HUST; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51805184)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51805184).

In this study, recycled short carbon fibers were combined with recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) to obtain carbon fiber-reinforced PET filaments via melt extrusion. The carbon fiber content of the extruded filaments ranged from 0.4 to 40.7 wt%. The molar mass and the degree of crystallinity after processing were determined to evaluate the influence of the extrusion process on the physico-chemical and mechanical properties of the reinforced PET filaments. Furthermore, pressure-volume-temperature measurements were carried out to investigate the influence of the carbon fibers on the shrinkage of the semi-crystalline PET. Samples were printed and their superior mechanical properties, including a 390% increase in tensile modulus, were confirmed via tensile testing. Analysis via X-ray micro-computed tomography indicated that the fiber length reduced with increasing fiber content. The high degree of fiber alignment that was observed in the extruded filaments, was slightly reduced after deposition. Scanning electron microscopy data showed that fiber pull-out was the governing failure mechanism, indicating a weak interface between the carbon fibers and the matrix. The results show the potential of extrusion-based additive manufacturing to valorize recycled PET and recycled carbon fibers. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Fused filament fabrication; Mechanical properties; Melt extrusion; Recycled carbon fibers; Recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate); Shrinkage","3D printers; Additives; Carbon fibers; Computerized tomography; Crystallinity; Ethylene; Extrusion; Fabrication; Melt spinning; Plastic recycling; Reinforcement; Scanning electron microscopy; Shrinkage; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Effect of carbons; Fibers content; Fused filament fabrication; Melt extrusion; PET filaments; Physicomechanical properties; Recycled carbon fibres; Recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate); Recycled polyethylene terephthalates; Polyethylene terephthalates","","","","","Agency for Innovation and Entrepreneurship Flanders, (PET2VALUE)","The authors acknowledge the support of the Agency for Innovation and Entrepreneurship Flanders via the Strategic Initiative Materials NANOFORCE research program: projects RELFICOM and PET2VALUE.

However, to date, the crack susceptibility of conventional alloys as well as the high prices for specially developed alloys are the main obstacles for the use of high-strength aluminum alloys for LPBF. In this paper, crack-free LPBF samples with a relative density >99.9% were processed from AlMgSi1Zr (6182 series alloy) powder, to which 0.5 wt.-% Zr and 0.5 wt.-% Ti were added via mechanical mixing. No hot cracks were found in the µCT scans. Moreover, a fully equiaxed microstructure with a mean size of the α-Al grains of 1.2 µm was observed in the as-built parts. Al3(Zr,Ti) particles were observed, acting as efficient heterogeneous grain refiners for α-Al by building a semi-coherent interface. Unmolten Ti and Zr particles with sizes up to 80 µm were found in the α-Al phase. The resulting fine-grained microstructure led to a tensile strength of 329 ± 4 MPa and a total elongation at a break of 11.4 ± 0.9% after solution heat treatment, quenching in water, and subsequent artificial ageing. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; EBSD; grain refinement; high-strength aluminum alloys; hot cracks; in-situ alloying; selective laser melting; TEM","","","","","","","","Frazier W.E., Metal Additive Manufacturing: A Review, J.

Box 118, Lund, SE-221 00, Sweden","For the broader industrial usage of metal additive manufactured parts, especially made by laser powder bed fusion, a better prediction and understanding of the warpage and of eigenstresses within the final part are necessary. Due to the diverse and sophisticated metallurgical and thermal processes during production, physically motivated simulations are rather complex and time consuming. Therefore, various simplifications concerning the process and material models are frequently made, which leads to practicable simulation times at the expense of physical accuracy. This motivates the procedure in this contribution: A multiscale approach combining various modelling levels, in particular regarding the heat source and material model. The model is based on three finite element simulations on different levels and with different specific aims, i.e. the laser scan model, the layer hatch model and the part model. For the smallest scale considered, a sophisticated thermomechanically fully coupled model based on a phase transformation model explicitly considering the powder, molten, and re-solidified material is incorporated. The goal of this detailed simulation is to extract an effective heat source for the next level of simulation, i.e. the layer hatch model. The layer hatch model is used to extract the inherent strains for the part model. With these strains, the remaining deformation and eigenstresses of arbitrary large parts with the same material and laser parameters can be efficiently and directly computed. The capabilities of the present framework are investigated by simulations on the behaviour of a twin cantilever beam, where the effect of different process parameters on the overall material and structural response is carried out. © 2022 The Authors","Finite element method; Inherent strain method; Phase transformations; Thermomechanical coupling","Hatches; Phase transitions; Powder metals; Strain; Eigenstresses; Fusion process; Inherent strain methods; Laser powders; Material modeling; Multi-scale approaches; Phases transformation; Powder bed; Residual distortions; Thermo - mechanical couplings; Finite element method","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (271512359); Technische Universität Dortmund, TUDO","The authors gratefully acknowledge the computing time provided on the Linux HPC cluster at TU Dortmund University (LiDO3), partially funded in the course of the Large-Scale Equipment Initiative by the German Research Foundation (DFG) as project 271512359 .

However, after fabrication, the non-tunable and single permanent shape limits the development of SMPs. Here, we obtained a bilayer structure by depositing SMP on a taut pre-strain layer using 4D printing, which produces complex bidirectional spatial 3D shape transformation under the combined effect of the pre-strain layer and 3D printing layer. In addition, the effects of 3D printed layer thickness, aspect ratio, filling angle, filling rate, elongation of pre-strained layer, and deflection angle of pre-strained layer stretching direction and 3D printing long axis direction on the deformation of bilayer structure were investigated. The results show that by adjusting the above factors, the initial upward bending curvature of the bilayer structure, reverse downward deformation mode, and degree of bilayer structure under IR action was programmable. Thus, the adjustment of the permanent shape of the bilayer structure was achieved by using the above strategies. Meanwhile, with the presence of 3D printed layer SMP, the bilayer structure also has shape memory properties for complex shape memory. Therefore, this study further enriches the deformation modes of 4D printed SMPs to provide more complex and controllable permanent shape deformation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","","3D printers; Aspect ratio; Functional polymers; Shape-memory polymer; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Bi-layer structure; Complex deformation; Deformation modes; Permanent shapes; Pre-strain; Shape memory polymers; Strain layers; Strained layers; Deformation","","","","","Jilin Province Science and Technology Development Plan Project, (YDZJ202101ZYTS071); National key R & D projects, (2018YFF01012402); Open Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Mineral Processing, (BGRIMM-KJSKL-2021-25); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52005211)","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52005211), the Jilin Province Science and Technology Development Plan Project (No. YDZJ202101ZYTS071), and National key R & D projects (No. 2018YFF01012402), and Open Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Mineral Processing (BGRIMM-KJSKL-2021-25).

Finite element modeling in the oral environment showed that the maximum von-Mises strains of cortical and cancellous bone around graded scaffolds with 20–50 % porosities were in the range of 100–3000 με and 1000–3000 με, respectively, which is beneficial for bone regeneration. Additionally, the graded scaffolds exhibited higher compressive yield strength (206.1–477.5 MPa) yet suitable elastic modulus (8.5–20.7 GPa) compared with human cortical bone. Permeability of graded scaffolds increased with increasing porosity that all fall in the range of the permeability for human bone. Corrosion rate of graded scaffolds with 20–40 % porosity satisfied the corrosion resistance for metallic implants (2.5 × 10−4/mm/yr). Moreover, the graded scaffolds with 20–40 % porosity exhibited 0-I grade toxic effects on mouse embryonic osteoblast precursor cell proliferation in vitro. Taken together, the graded scaffold with 30 % porosity meets all requirements as a promising dental implant. In addition, this study provided a rational approach for screening the best geometrical design of the implants in dentistry. © 2022 The Authors","Biocompatibility; Dental applications; Finite element analysis; Graded titanium scaffold; Selective laser melting","Biocompatibility; Bone; Cell proliferation; Corrosion rate; Corrosion resistance; Dental prostheses; Melting; Metal implants; Porosity; Scaffolds; Scaffolds (biology); Selective laser melting; Titanium; Application design; Applications characterizations; Dental applications; Finite element analyse; Functionally graded; Graded titania scaffold; Gyroids; Porous titania; Selective laser melting; Titanium scaffolds; Finite element method","","","","","Postdoctor Research Foundation of Shunde Graduate School of University of Science and Technology Beijing, (2022BH001); State Key Lab of Advanced Metals and Materials; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51874037, 51922004); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Central South University, CSU; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2021M700377); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (2212035, L212014); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality; University of Science and Technology Beijing, USTB, (2020Z-04, 2021Z-03, 2022Z-12, FRF-IDRY-20-023); University of Science and Technology Beijing, USTB; State Key Laboratory of Powder Metallurgy, SKLPM; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (06500236, FRF-TP-19005C1Z, QNXM20220057); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2021A1515110548); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","This research work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (51922004, 51874037), State Key Lab of Advanced Metals and Materials, University of Science and Technology Beijing (2020Z-04, 2021Z-03, 2022Z-12), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (FRF-TP-19005C1Z, 06500236, QNXM20220057), Interdisciplinary Research Project for Young Teachers of USTB (Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, FRF-IDRY-20-023), Postdoctor Research Foundation of Shunde Graduate School of University of Science and Technology Beijing (2022BH001), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2021M700377), Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2021A1515110548), State Key Laboratory of Powder Metallurgy, Central South University and Natural Science Foundation of Beijing (2212035, L212014).","Zhang D., Qiu D., Gibson M.A., Zheng Y., Fraser H.L., StJohn D.H., Easton M.A., Additive manufacturing of ultrafine-grained high-strength titanium alloys, Nature, 576, pp. 91-95, (2019); Xu W., Hou C.J., Mao Y.X., Yang L., Tamaddon M., Zhang J.L., Qu X.H., Liu C.Z., Su B., Lu X., Characteristics of novel Ti-10Mo-xCu alloy by powder metallurgy for potential biomedical implant applications, Bioact.

The influence of HP-LPBF process parameters for densification of 18Ni300 maraging steel (MS18Ni300), as well as the related optical micrograph (OM), microstructure, phase composition, and mechanical properties of optimal relative density specimens, were comprehensively examined in this study. The sequence of HP-LPBF process parameters on the relative density of the specimens was investigated using the orthogonal experimental method. With a relative density of 99.18 ± 0.11 % and a surface roughness of 3.59 ± 0.32 μm, the optimal process parameters was attained. The influence of adding SiC on the specimens' OM, microstructure, phase composition, and mechanical properties were compared and studied. The results show that the building direction (BD) is the dominant heat flow direction in HP-LPBF by EBSD analysis and that the rotating 67° scanning strategy can effectively improve the isotropy of the mechanical properties of HP-LPBF parts. The MS18Ni300 specimen has a particularly thin cellular microstructures with a diameter of 6.11 μm. In addition, the dominant phase composition of the MS18Ni300 specimen was martensite (α). The microstructure of SiC (volume fraction of 1 %)/MS18Ni300 (M1) composites was significantly refined, and changes in the microstructure were primarily due to SiC's physical properties. The addition of SiC particles leads to a weakening of the preferred crystallographic orientation of the grains. The average grain size was 3.21 μm. No new phases were produced, but the mechanical properties were improved. The ultimate tensile strength and hardness of M1 were 1.33 GPa and 390.2 HV, respectively. The strengthening mechanism of SiC was discussed. © 2022","High-precision laser powder bed fusion (HP-LPBF); Mechanical properties; Microstructure; MS18Ni300 maraging steel (MS18Ni300); Processing optimization","Density (specific gravity); Maraging steel; Molds; Particle size analysis; Phase composition; Silicon alloys; Silicon carbide; Silicon steel; Surface roughness; Tensile strength; Fusion process; High-precision; High-precision laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Ms18ni300 maraging steel (ms18ni300); Optical micrographs; Powder bed; Process parameters; Processing optimizations; Relative density; Microstructure","","","","","Guangdong Science and Technology Department, GDSTC, (2020B090924002); Guangdong Science and Technology Department, GDSTC","This research was supported by Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province (No. 2020B090924002 ).

However, these high strength Al alloys normally exhibit severely non-uniform plasticity due to the strain incompatibility of bimodal grain structure, which hinders their practical application. In this work, an Al-Mn-Sc based alloy has been fabricated through laser-directed energy deposition (L-DED). The results revealed that during deposition, the precipitation of primary Al3(Sc, Zr) particles can be more homogeneous in the entire melt pool due to the relatively low cooling rate and temperature compared with that of L-PBF, fully exploiting the ability of Al3(Sc, Zr) particles to promote α-Al nucleation. Therefore, fully equiaxed grains of 5–6 µm in diameter without preferential crystallographic orientation have been obtained. This leads to excellent strength and ductility with a good strain hardening capacity without the need for subsequent forming processes, which has successfully tackled the non-uniform plasticity issue associated with the L-PBF counterparts. This alloy possesses a yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of 230 and 331 MPa, respectively, with a uniform elongation of 8.3% at the as-fabricated stage. After a simple post-heat treatment at 300 ℃ for 3 h, the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength can reach up to 425 and 519 MPa, respectively, accompanied with 6.2% uniform elongation. The yield strength in the direct-aged state exceeds all the existing Al alloys manufactured by various DED methods. The current results bode well for the achievement of high strength Al alloys engineering components fabricated by L-DED for future industrial adoption. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Al-Mn-Sc based alloys; Laser-directed energy deposition; Mechanical properties; Microstructures; Strain hardening","Aluminum alloys; Deposition; Ductility; Fabrication; Heat treatment; High strength alloys; Manganese alloys; Plasticity; Precipitation (chemical); Scandium alloys; Strain; Strain hardening; Tensile strength; Ternary alloys; Textures; Al-alloy; Al-mn-sc based alloy; Directed energy; Energy depositions; High-strength; Laser powders; Laser-directed energy deposition; Non-uniform; Powder bed; Ultimate tensile strength; Yield stress","","","","","Monash Centre for Additive Manufacturing; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2021JJ40773); University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, USST; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFB3700904)","Funding text 1: The authors gratefully acknowledge the use of instruments and scientific and technical assistance at the Monash Centre for Additive Manufacturing (MCAM).

However, the thermal conditions experienced during the HIP cycle may create undesirable phases in some alloys and post HIP heat treatments including solution treatment + ageing may be necessary to achieve the desired final properties. It is currently unknown whether post-HIP heat treatments at standard atmospheric pressures promote the re-emergence of previously closed porosity in aluminium alloys produced by Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM). Using micro 3D computed tomography, this work quantitatively investigates the extent of pore regrowth during post-HIP solution treatment and ageing of Al 2319 produced by WAAM. It is found that large porosity (diameters > 35 µm) that is closed during HIP mostly remain closed during subsequent heat treatment but almost a 3-fold increase in the frequency of fine gas porosity occurs during post HIP heat treatment. However, the overall porosity distribution after post HIP heat treatment remains up to 95 % lower than in the original as-built condition, indicating that HIP + heat treatments remain a viable pathway for defect reduction in industrial products. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Aluminium alloy; Heat treatment; Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP); Porosity; Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM)","3D printers; Additives; Atmospheric pressure; Computerized tomography; Defects; Porosity; Sintering; Wire; 3d computed tomographies; Fusion defects; Hot isostatic pressing; Hot-isostatic pressings; Manufacturing IS; Property; Solution treatments; Thermal condition; Wire arc; Wire arc additive manufacturing; Hot isostatic pressing","","","","","Queensland Centre for Advanced Materials Processing and Manufacturing; University of Queensland's School of Mechanical and Mining Engineering; Mater Foundation, MF; Translational Research Institute Australia, TRI; DMTC","Funding text 1: This paper includes research that was supported by DMTC Limited (Australia).

Selective mapping (SLM) is a well-known effective PAPR reduction technique, but it suffers from high computational complexity. To reduce the PAPR of OFDM signals, a low-complexity, partition-recombined SLM (PRSLM) scheme is proposed. The PRSLM scheme can generate more candidate signals than that of the conventional-original SLM (COSLM) scheme. The real and imaginary components of time-domain symbols are first partitioned, and then recombined to generate new candidate signals, which reduces computational complexity significantly. A 40-GBaud single-polarization CO-OFDM transmission system is set up to evaluate the performance of the PRSLM scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves 61.9% reduction in complex multiplication complexity, and 60.3% reduction in addition complexity compared with the COSLM scheme when the FFT size is 128. Furthermore, the proposed scheme achieves a similar PAPR reduction performance to the COSLM scheme without bit error rate degradation. In a nutshell, the PRSLM scheme improves noise tolerance and implementation efficiency of high-speed optical communication as well as alleviates nonlinear impairments. © 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","coherent optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; complementary cumulative distribution function; computational complexity reduction ratio; peak-to-average power ratio; selective mapping","Bit error rate; Computational complexity; Distribution functions; Mapping; Optical fiber communication; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Orthogonal functions; Coherent optical orthogonal frequencydivision multiplexing (CO-OFDM); Complementary cumulative distribution functions; Computational complexity reduction ratio; Computational complexity reductions; Lower complexity; Mapping scheme; Peak-to-average power ratio reductions; Peakto-average power ratios (PAPR); Reduction ratios; Selective mapping; Peak to average power ratio","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61727817, 61835002, 61935005, 62021005); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFB1801302); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant 2018YFB1801302) and in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants Nos. 61835002, 62021005, 61727817, and 61935005.","Wang F., Et al., Dynamic distributed multi-path aided load balancing for optical data center networks, IEEE Trans.

However, their random arrangement easily leads to mutual consumption of magnetic poles, thereby weakening the magnetic stimulation effect. Methods: In this study, magnetic nanochains are synthesized by magnetic-field-guided interface co-assembly of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. In detail, multiple Fe3O4 nanoparticles are aligned along the direction of magnetic force lines and are connected in series to form nanochain structures under an external magnetic field. Subsequently, the nanochain structures are covered and fixed by depositing a thin layer of silica (SiO2), and consequently forming linear magnetic nanochains (Fe3O4@SiO2). The Fe3O4@SiO2 nanochains are then incorporated into poly l-lactic acid (PLLA) scaffold prepared by selective laser sintering technology. Results: The results show that the Fe3O4@SiO2 nanochains with unique core–shell structure are successfully constructed. Meanwhile, the orderly assembly of nanoparticles in the Fe3O4@SiO2 nanochains enable to form magnetic energy coupling and obtain a highly magnetic micro-field. The in vitro tests indicate that the PLLA/Fe3O4@SiO2 scaffolds exhibit superior capacity in enhancing cell activity, improving osteogenesis-related gene expressions, and inducing cell mineralization compared with PLLA and PLLA/Fe3O4 scaffolds. Conclusion: In short, the Fe3O4@SiO2 nanochains endow scaffolds with good magnetism and cytocompatibility, which have great potential in accelerating bone repair. © 2022, The Author(s).","Bone scaffold; Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles; Magnetic energy coupling; Magnetic microenvironment; Magnetic nanochains","magnetic nanoparticle; nanochain; Article; body weight loss; bone development; bone regeneration; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; cell viability; chemical bond; controlled study; gene expression; magnetic field; magnetic stimulation; microenvironment; mineralization; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; real time polymerase chain reaction; selective laser sintering; transmission electron microscopy","","","","","Provincial Key R&D Projects of Jiangxi, (20201BBE51012); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51935014, 52105352, 52165043, 81871498, 82072084); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province, (20202BAB214011, 2020ACB214004); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province; Jiangxi University of Science and Technology, JUST, (205200100535); Jiangxi University of Science and Technology, JUST; State Key Laboratory of High Performance Complex Manufacturing","This study was supported by the following funds: (1) The Natural Science Foundation of China (52105352, 51935014, 52165043, 82072084, 81871498); (2) The Project of Jiangxi University of Science and Technology (205200100535); (3) JiangXi Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (2020ACB214004, 20202BAB214011); (4) The Provincial Key R&D Projects of Jiangxi (20201BBE51012); (5) The Project of State Key Laboratory of High Performance Complex Manufacturing.

Here we used a newly developed bioprinting technology, termed laser-induced side transfer (LIST), to print human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and to spatially guide endothelial tubulogenesis. We investigated the effect of three bioprinting matrices (fibrin, Matrigel and Matrigel/thrombin) on HUVECs self-assembly. Furthermore, we studied the effect of pro- and anti-angiogenic compounds on sprouting angiogenesis and tubulogenesis. We found that HUVECs self-assembly is optimal on Matrigel/thrombin due to the formation of fibrin stripes that enhance HUVECs confinement and adhesion. Importantly, we showed that treatment of printed HUVEC lines with the anti-angiogenic factor bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) significantly improves the percentage of lumen coverage. Our results showcase LIST as a powerful bioprinting technology to study tubulogenesis and to screen compounds targeting microvasculature pathologies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Angiogenesis; Bioprinting; Bone morphogentic protein 9 (BMP9); Drop-on-demand; Laser-assisted bioprinting; Laser-induced side transfer; Lumen formation","angiogenesis inhibitor; fibrin; matrigel; adhesion; angiogenesis assay; Article; bioprinting; bone regeneration; confocal microscopy; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug screening; flow kinetics; fluorescence intensity; human; human cell; HUVEC cell line; immunofluorescence; laser induced side transfer; microcirculation; microvasculature; spatially guided endothelial tubulogenesis; tubulogenesis","","fibrin, 9001-31-4; matrigel, 119978-18-6","AxioExaminer Z1, Carl Zeiss; Hybrid 2, TA Instruments, United States","Carl Zeiss; TA Instruments, United States","Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé, FRQS, (312263, 265459, 253123); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (RGPIN-2018-06767); Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologies, FRQNT, (263066)","The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Christos Boutopoulos reports financial support was provided by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (RGPIN-2018-06767).

In fact, internal defects can have a detrimental effect on the fatigue behaviour and cause final component failure. Therefore, process-induced defects must be localized and evaluated at a higher level of detail. The present study deals with the correlation amongst pores and LPBF process parameters in AlSi10Mg components. Computed tomography (CT) allows an extensive examination of internal defects. Within this work, a total number of 2,939,830 pores detected in 96 cylindrical samples were analysed using CT. The formation of pores can be adjusted by varying the modified volume energy density, for example, by using various laser scanning speeds. Furthermore, the effect of powder preparation scan strategies (pre-heating and pre-sintering) on the formation of different pore types as well as the general reproducibility was examined. For instance, the shielding gas flow, contaminated protective windows of the lasers as well as prior powder preparation influence the formation of pores. Using prior laser powder preparation reduced the total number of pores at high scanning speeds up to 45%. When the scanning speed is increased, the number of spherical pores decreases and large and irregularly shaped pores appear. Interestingly, only the pre-heating process resulted in a reduced formation of spherical pores at low scanning speeds (1000 mm/s). © 2022, The Author(s).","AlSi10Mg; Computed tomography; Laser powder bed fusion;

A follow-up hammering-assisted (FH) hybrid wire arc additive manufacturing process is proposed to improve the microstructure of deposited weld bead. The effects of different hammering temperatures (higher than Ae3 line) and different deformation amount on the microstructure are systematically studied, and the effect on mechanical properties is investigated correspondingly by fabricating a deposited block. The Electron Back Scatter Diffraction (EBSD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and Optical Microscopy (OM) are used for characterization. The results show that the FH process can significantly refine the grain size of deposited weld bead, and meanwhile weaken the texture strength. The grain refinement mechanism for hammering higher than the austenite recrystallization temperature is austenite dynamic recrystallization. Instead, for hammering lower than the austenite recrystallization temperature, the more significant grain refinement is attributed to the high-temperature deformation increasing the ferrite phase transformation nucleation site, nucleation rate and the deformation-induced ferrite phase transformation. Hammering temperature 850 °C and hammering deformation 40% are determined to be the optimal process parameters to refine the grains. Using the optimal process parameters, the strength and hardness of the deposited layers are greatly promoted, and the anisotropy is also improved, while the ductility is reduced to some degree, but improved obviously compared to the low-temperature hammering. © 2022","Ferrite transformation; Grain refinement; High-temperature hammering; Microstructure; Texture; Wire arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Austenite; Deformation; Dynamic recrystallization; Ferrite; Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; Nucleation; Scanning electron microscopy; Temperature; Welds; Wire; Austenite recrystallisation; Ferrite transformation; Follow up; Grains refinement; High-temperature hammering; Highest temperature; Recrystallization temperatures; Weld bead; Wire arc; Wire arc additive manufacturing; Textures","","","","","Technical Innovation Special Project of Hubei Province, (2020BED010); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (IRT17R83); Key Technologies Research and Development Program, (2018YFB1106500)","This work is financially supported by the China Key Technologies Research and Development Program ( 2018YFB1106500 ), the Technical Innovation Special Project of Hubei Province ( 2020BED010 ) and the Innovative Research Team Development Program of Ministry of Education of China (No. IRT17R83 ).","Marinelli G., Martina F., Ganguly S., Williams S., Grain refinement in an unalloyed tantalum structure by combining Wire+Arc additive manufacturing and vertical cold rolling, Addit Manuf, 32, (2020); Lin Z., Song K., Yu X., A review on wire and arc additive manufacturing of titanium alloy, J.

However, the parts fabricated using LPBF exhibit high porosity and rough texture, which severely hinders the development of this technology. In this study, typical Al-based (AlSi10Mg) and Ni-based (Inconel 718) alloys were fabricated under a wide range of parameter spaces using static magnetic field (SMF) of up to 0.2 T. The experimental results showed that the fabricated parts had a higher density with SMF than the samples fabricated without SMF. A comparison of the samples fabricated with and without SMF revealed that the SMF refined the grain size and improved the mechanical properties. Furthermore, physics-based models, including the Seebeck effect, heat transfer, and fluid flow, in melt pools dynamics were used to simulate the thermos-electric-magnetic (TEM) forces and flow patterns during LPBF. The results of the simulation suggest that at the melt pool scale, the depression zone depth increases with increasing SMF intensity, and the correspondingly increased laser absorptivity is the main reason for the decrease in the lack-of-fusion defects. In addition to the flow pattern change at the melt pool scale, the TEM force acting on the cellular dendrite also plays an important role in grain refinement, reaching 105 N/m3 under a SMF of 0.1 T. Furthermore, the results of the tensile tests showed an increase in the ultimate tensile strength and elongation of the printed samples under the applied SMF. The present study can guide the porosity control and the widening of the processing window in LPBF. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Laser powder bed fusion; Microstructure; Porosity; Property; Static magnetic field","Fabrication; Flow patterns; Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; Heat transfer; Lakes; Magnetic fields; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Textures; Densifications; Electric magnetic; Grains refinement; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Magnetic force; Melt pool; Powder bed; Property; Static magnetic fields; Porosity","","","","","Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR, (A20E5c0091); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51771118, 51821001, 51901135, 52071205); National Major Science and Technology Projects of China, (J2019-VI-0004-0117)","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51901135 , 52071205 , 51771118 , and 51821001 ), National Science and Technology Major Project ( J2019-VI-0004-0117 ).

The integration of topology optimization procedures and additive manufacturing techniques can make the most of their advantages, and there is significant interest today in integrating both approaches. Imposing overhang constraints in topology optimization has been addressed, but primarily for classical topology optimization problems with fixed external loads, not design-dependent loads. This work combines an effective numerical procedure for contour evaluation with a modified version of the power-law model for low densities to eliminate the problems that arise when self-weight loads are considered. The overhang edge detection is based on the Smallest Univalue Segment Assimilating Nucleus (SUSAN) method, and a variable mask size technique is used to avoid eventual dripping problems. The proposed constraint function evaluates the overhang globally and allows control of the formation of unsupported contours for maximum stiffness design problems when self-weight loads are present. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness and robustness. © 2022, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; Overhang constraint; Self-weight; Topology optimization","Additives; Numerical methods; Shape optimization; Structural optimization; Topology; Classical topologies; Design-dependent loads; External loads; Manufacturing techniques; Numerical procedures; Optimization problems; Optimization procedures; Overhang constraint; Self-weight; Topology optimisation; 3D printers","","","","","Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea, EHU, UPV/EHU; Ekonomiaren Garapen eta Lehiakortasun Saila, Eusko Jaurlaritza, (IT919-16); European Union’s Horizon 2020 Joint Technology Initiative Shift2Rail, (IN2TRACK2, 826255, IN2TRACK3, 101012456); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (101012456)","Open Access funding provided thanks to the CRUE-CSIC agreement with Springer Nature.

In industrial production with variable component shapes and dimensions, the part orientation will often be a matter of the available space in the build volume. Additionally, build-to-build variability is an important factor that may impact the mechanical properties that are often not quantified. Such sources of variability are of great importance for highly demanding sectors such as aviation and aerospace, where lightweight Al-alloys are often used with the geometrical freedom given by the LPBF process. Hence, this work systematically investigates the influence of production batch-related parameters together with part inclination in the LPBF of AlSi7Mg0.6 alloy. Three builds were executed to quantify the impact of the batch, part position, and inclination on the static and fatigue resistance of the alloy in a completely randomized experimental design using an industrial LPBF machine. The results were analysed by the appropriate statistical methods both for discrete and functional data. The results showed that while the part orientation only influenced the static properties, the part position significantly affected the fatigue life demonstrated by the different low cycle fatigue life coefficients. © 2022 The Authors","AlSi7Mg0.6;

Moreover, lattice-mismatch and thermal stress at CZTS/Mo interface nourish strained growth, which adversely affects the Cu-Zn ordering in CZTS. Thus far, understanding and evolution of these residual strains and their influence on the optoelectronic properties of CZTS are lacking. Herein, we probed the residual strain along penetration depth and demonstrated a facile approach of tailoring lattice strain in CZTS. High quality CZTS films with seed layer (SL) growth are developed to investigate residual strain distribution using depth-dependent grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements. A graded strain has been identified in SL films than uniformly strained no SL films. Besides improvement in Cu-Zn order, Photoluminescence (PL) signal in SL films was substantially quenched by 55.3%, which is ascribed to the charge transfer as a consequence of graded strain. Graded strain in SL films tends to form multi-homojunction, influencing charge carrier dynamics, resulting in a 36-fold increase in photocurrent and approximately 5 times faster response over No SL CZTS based device. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Cu-Zn disorder; CZTS absorber; Graded strain; Residual strain; Seed layer; Strain engineering","Binary alloys; Charge transfer; Lattice mismatch; Semiconductor quantum wells; Tin compounds; Absorber layers; Cu-zn disorder; CZTS absorber; Graded strain; Kesterites; Residual strains; Secondary defect; Secondary phase; Seed layer; Strain engineering; Strain","","","","","Solar Energy Research Initiative ( SERI ), Government of India, (DST/ TMC/SERI/FR/118); Solar Energy Research Initiative (SERI), Government of India; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी","Funding text 1: The authors gratefully acknowledge the grant from the Department of Science and Technology (DST) under the Solar Energy Research Initiative (SERI), Government of India (DST/ TMC/SERI/FR/118).

A crystallographic lamellar microstructure (CLM) with a 〈0 0 1〉 // the building direction (BD) growth texture in the center layer was obtained. The increase of hatch spacing can influence the intensity of 〈0 0 1〉 // BD growth texture in the center layer and deflect the 〈0 1 1〉 oriented dendrites in the overlapping layer to the scanning direction. Meanwhile, with the increase of hatch spacing, the primary dendrite arm spacing increases, and morphologies of the interdendritic precipitated Laves phases change from discrete dots to chains. The selection effect of laser remelting was discovered, which works as the “selector” for preferential orientation grains. Through several times of interlayer laser remelting, the grains with preferential orientations are selected by competitive growth.

In case of Budgeted Influence Maximization (BIM), the users of the network have a cost and influential user selection needs to be done within a given budget. In case of Earned Benefit Maximization (EBM) Problem, a set of target users along with their benefit value is given and the aim is to choose highly influential users within an allocated budget to maximize the earned benefit. In this paper, we study the BIM and EBM Problem under the tag-specific edge probability setting, which means instead of a single edge probability a set of probability values (each one for a specific context e.g., ‘games,’ ‘academics,’ etc.) per edge is given. The aim is to identify the influential tags and users for maximizing the influence and earned benefit. Considering the realistic fact that different tags have a different impact on different communities of a social network, we propose two solution methodologies and one pruning technique. A detailed analysis of all the solution approaches has been done. An extensive set of experiments have been carried out with three benchmark datasets. From the experiments, we observe that the proposed solution approaches outperform baseline methods (e.g., random node-random tag, high-degree node–high-frequency tag, high-degree node–high-frequency tag with community). For the tag-based BIM Problem the improvement is upto 8 % in terms of number of influenced nodes and for the tag-based EBM Problem the improvement is upto 15 % in terms of earned benefit. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Influence probability; MIA model; Seed set; Social network","Architectural design; Budget control; Economic and social effects; Social networking (online); Benefit maximization; High-degree nodes; Influence maximizations; Influence probability; Influential users; Maximization problem; MIA model; Seed-set; Social network; Solution approach; Probability","","","","","","","Banerjee S., Jenamani M., Pratihar D.K., Combim: A community-based solution approach for the budgeted influence maximization problem, Expert Syst Appl, (2019); Banerjee S., Jenamani M., Pratihar D.K., Maximizing the earned benefit in an incentivized social networking environment: A community-based approach, J Ambient Intell Hum Comput, pp. 1-17, (2019); Banerjee S., Jenamani M., Pratihar D.K., Maximizing the earned benefit in an incentivized social networking environment: a community-based approach, J Ambient Intell Hum Comput, 11, 6, pp. 2539-2555, (2020); Banerjee S., Jenamani M., Pratihar D.K., A survey on influence maximization in a social network, Knowl Inf Syst, pp. 1-39, (2020); Banerjee S., Pal B., Jenamani M., Budgeted influence maximization with tags in social networks, International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering.

However, due to the imperfect preparation of biological samples, ssTEM images are usually degraded with various artifacts that greatly challenge the subsequent analysis and visualization. In this paper, we introduce a unified deep learning framework for ssTEM image restoration which addresses three main types of artifacts, i.e., Support Film Folds (SFF), Staining Precipitates (SP), and Missing Sections (MS). To achieve this goal, we first model the appearance of SFF and SP artifacts by conducting comprehensive analyses on the statistics of real degraded images, relying on which we can then simulate a large number of paired images (degraded/artifacts-free) for training a deep restoration network. Then, we design a coarse-to-fine restoration network consisting of three modules, i.e., interpolation, correction, and fusion. The interpolation module exploits the adjacent artifacts-free images for an initial restoration, while the correction module resorts to the degraded image itself to rectify the artifacts. Finally, the fusion module jointly utilizes the above two results to further improve the restoration fidelity. Experimental results on both synthetic and real test data validate the significantly improved performance of our proposed framework over existing solutions, in terms of both image restoration fidelity and neuron segmentation accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first unified deep learning framework for ssTEM image restoration from different types of artifacts.  © 2022 IEEE.","deep learning; Image restoration; ssTEM","Artifacts; Deep Learning; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Adaptive optics; Deep learning; Electromagnetic wave attenuation; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Image analysis; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Interpolation; Restoration; Deep learning; Degraded images; Learning frameworks; Optical attenuators; Optical imaging; Restoration network; Serial section; Serial section transmission electron microscopy; Transmission electron microscopy images; article; artifact; deep learning; diagnostic test accuracy study; fluorescence imaging; image reconstruction; nerve cell; optics; precipitation; transmission electron microscopy; image processing; procedures; Image reconstruction","","","","","University Synergy Innovation Program of Anhui Province, (GXXT-2019-025); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62021001); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFA0700800); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2017YFA0700800, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62021001, and in part by the University Synergy Innovation Program of Anhui Province under Grant GXXT-2019-025.","Zheng Z., Lauritzen J., Perlman E., Robinson C., A complete electron microscopy volume of the brain of adult Drosophila melanogaster, Cell, 174, 3, pp. 730-743, (2018); Bock D.D., Et al., Network anatomy and in vivo physiology of visual cortical neurons, Nature, 471, 7337, pp. 177-182, (2011); Tapia J.C., Et al., High-contrast en bloc staining of neuronal tissue for field emission scanning electron microscopy, Nature Protocols, 7, 2, pp. 193-206, (2012); Harris K.M., Perry E., Bourne J., Feinberg M., Ostroff L., Hurlburt J., Uniform serial sectioning for transmission electron microscopy, J.

Usually, EAM is performed with filament feedstock, but using pellets instead of filaments yields many benefits, including significantly lower cost and a wider choice of materials. High-performance polymers offer high strength even when produced with AM technique, allowing to produce near-net-shape functional parts. The production of these materials in filament form is still limited and expensive; therefore, in this paper, the possibility of producing AM components with engineering polymers from pellets will be thoroughly investigated. In this work, the effectiveness of a specially designed AM machine for printing high-performance materials in pellet form was tested. The material chosen for the investigation is PEI 1000 which offers outstanding mechanical and thermal properties, giving the possibility to produce with EAM functional components. Sensitivity analyses have been carried out to define a process window in terms of thermal process parameters by observing different response variables. Using the process parameters in the specified range, the additive manufactured material has been mechanically tested, and its microstructure has been investigated, both in dried and undried conditions. Finally, a rapid tool for sheet metal forming has been produced. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing; high strength polymer; material extrusion additive manufacturing; mechanical testing; PEI; process window; rapid tooling; thermal parameters; ULTEM","","","","","","","","Srivastava M., Rathee S., Additive manufacturing: Recent trends, applications and future outlooks, Prog.

However, Laser-Powder Bed Fusion fabrication of a water-atomized 25Cr7Ni stainless steel of novel chemical composition resulted in a purely ferritic microstructure and over 5% porosity. The current study investigated the effects of two hot isostatic pressing parameters on the physical, mechanical, and corrosion properties as well as microstructures of water-atomized 25Cr7Ni stainless steel of novel composition fabricated by L-PBF for the first time in the literature. The corrosion behaviour was studied using linear sweep voltammetry in a 3.5% NaCl solution. The Hot Isostatic Pressing-treated sample achieved over 98% densification with a corresponding reduction in porosity to less than 0.1% and about 3~4% in annihilation of dislocation density. A duplex microstructure of ferrite 60% and austenite 40%was observed in the X-Ray Diffraction and etched metallography of the HIP-treated samples from a purely ferritic microstructure prior to the HIP treatment. With the evolution of austenite phase, the HIP-treated samples recorded a decrease in Ultimate Tensile Strength, yield strength, and hardness in comparison with as-printed samples. The variation in the morphology of the evolved austenite grains in the HIP-treated samples was observed to have a significant effect on the elongation. With a reduction in porosity and the evolution of the austenite phase, the HIP-treated samples showed a higher corrosion resistance in comparison with the as-printed samples. © 2022 by the authors.","25Cr7Ni stainless steel; corrosion properties; hot isostatic pressing; L-PBF","","","","","","","","Gunn R., Duplex Stainless Steels Microstructure, Properties and Applications, Anti-Corros.

Termed the CFD imposed FEM (CIFEM), the transient thermal fields from a high-fidelity CFD simulation and inferred by deep learning are imposed as temperature values rather than utilizing a conventional heat source model as in existing FEM-based process simulations. These fields are enforced only within a relatively small computational region encompassing the melt pool, while heat diffusion effects elsewhere are solved via the FEM. For a wide range of laser power and scan speeds covering the conduction, transition, and keyhole melting regimes, 29 of the 30 total CIFEM-simulated melt pool sizes lie within two standard deviations of the experimental melt pool sizes. Compared with the CFD simulations, the thermal fields obtained by CIFEM possess 7.44% mean absolute relative error (MARE), significantly less than the 43.76% MARE on three representative test cases simulated using the Goldak heat source model calibrated to the measured melt pool dimensions. In terms of computational efficiency, the CIFEM model running on a GPU card with 4,608 Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) cores is 28.2× more efficient than the CFD simulations running on 24 CPU cores in parallel. © 2022 The Authors","Computational fluid dynamics; Deep learning; Finite element method; Heat source; Laser powder bed fusion","","","","","","","","DebRoy T., Wei H.L., Zuback J.S., Mukherjee T., Elmer J.W., Milewski J.O., Et al., Additive manufacturing of metallic components – process, structure and properties, Prog.

Print bath support in these methods allows the biomaterial to solidify in place, mitigating the possibly negative effects of low viscosity and gravity. This material stability also permits for non-planar deposition of the biomaterial. Here, we developed a non-planar 3D print slicer for non-planar embedded bioprinting. We quantified the changes in ink deposition properties with respect to non-planar movement to understand printability in the system. Alginate prints in a FRESH support bath were used to quantify the capability of the slicer to create tunable mechanical properties. Mechanical testing reveals that geometric changes to the printed models can tune stiffness, failure stress and strain, and Poisson's ratio. These results demonstrate that using non-planar manufacturing can produce mechanically tunable properties with a homogeneous biomaterial. This may strengthen our ability to precisely match mechanical properties of native tissues to improve tissue engineering outcomes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Alginate; Embedded printing; FRESH; Non-planar bioprinting; Tissue engineering","alginic acid; biomaterial; hydrogel; algorithm; Article; bioprinting; bright field microscopy; computer aided design; geometry; gravity; human; mechanical test; tensile strength; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; viscosity","","alginic acid, 28961-37-7, 29894-36-8, 9005-32-7, 9005-38-3","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (DGE-1650441); National Science Foundation, NSF; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01 HL143247, R01 HL151190); National Institutes of Health, NIH; Cornell Center for Materials Research, CCMR, (DMR-1719875, DMR-1757420); Cornell Center for Materials Research, CCMR","This work was supported by funding from the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship ( DGE-1650441 ), National Institutes of Health R01 HL151190 and R01 HL143247 , and by the Cornell Center for Materials Research with funding from the Research Experience for Undergraduates program ( DMR-1757420 and DMR-1719875 ).

The magnitude of the residual heat depends on the scan length, hatch spacing, location on the track, etc. In this regard, back-and-forth raster scanning was performed to investigate the effect of the scan length and hatch spacing on the melt pool size at different locations along the laser travel direction. Multi-track specimens with different scan lengths (0.5 mm, 1 mm, and 1.5 mm) were fabricated using 195 W laser power, three scan speeds (375 mm/s, 750 mm/s, and 1500 mm/s), and two hatch spacings (80 µm and 120 µm). A white light interferometer was used to analyze the surface morphologies of the fabricated samples, and metallography was performed to observe the melt pool boundary. The melt pool boundary obtained at different locations revealed that the effect of the residual heat was maximal in the laser-turn region. In addition, a powder scale numerical model was developed to investigate the effect of temperature distribution on the melt pool geometry. The numerical results show that the laser-turn region was most affected by the residual heat, as the melt pool from the two tracks merged. The depth of the melt pool increased with increasing track numbers, while the track height decreased. The addition of a second layer of powder showed that the inherent surface variation in the first layer leads to the difference in the actual layer thickness of the second layer. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; laser powder bed fusion; melt pool; numerical modelling; porosity","","","","","","Manufacturing Machines & Equipment Program, (1662662); National Science Foundation, NSF","This research is partially supported by NSF, Manufacturing Machines & Equipment Program (Award # 1662662).","Yan C., Hao L., Hussein A., Raymont D., Evaluations of cellular lattice structures manufactured using selective laser melting, Int.

To enhance fatigue life, time consuming post-processing (e.g. machining, polishing) is typically applied to improve the surface quality. Laser remelting is a promising technique for surface quality improvement, applicable to variable shapes. However, laser remelting is traditionally only used as post-process since surfaces inclined with respect to the powder bed are covered with loose powder during building. Recently, the authors have developed a dual laser technique, which enables improving the quality of up-facing inclined surfaces during building. The technique consists of two steps: (1) selectively removing powder from inclined surfaces by laser-induced shock waves, (2) laser remelting newly exposed surfaces. This paper shows a clear improvement in three-point bending fatigue of such treated samples from maraging steel 18Ni-300 and titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V, compared to as-built state. This performance was quantified by the number of load cycles until failure at a fixed maximum tensile stress level. The improved performance could be linked to reduced surface roughness, total notch depth, critical stress concentration factor and a lower density of surface asperities. The remolten layer exhibited no visible defects and a decreased microhardness, which could beneficially impact the crack nucleation. This technique shows large potential for reducing the time and cost of metal parts produced by LPBF with enhanced fatigue performance by limiting or avoiding the need for surface post-processing. © 2022 The Author(s)","Dual laser processing; Fatigue; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser remelting; Surface treatment","","","","","","","","Elangeswaran C., Gurung K., Koch R., Cutolo A., Van Hooreweder B., Post-treatment selection for tailored fatigue performance of 18Ni300 maraging steel manufactured by laser powder bed fusion, Fatig.

These process-induced defects act as a stress raiser and deteriorates the mechanical and fatigue properties of the alloy. Post-processing is generally done to enhance the ductility and fatigue properties but at the expense of strength of the additively manufactured Ti6Al4V alloy. In this study, the effect of defects on mechanical properties and fatigue performance of additively manufactured (selective laser melting) Ti6Al4V alloy has been investigated based on experimentally calibrated defects-based model. The as-built specimens were subjected to different heat treatments in order to optimize their mechanical properties and the most optimum heat treatment was then selected for investigation of changes in fatigue properties. The beneficial effect of heat treatment on mechanical properties was mainly associated with the reduction in fraction of α’-martensitic microstructure and increase in α-lamellae thickness. Most of the fatigue failures occurred from surface and sub-surface defects, owing to the high stress concentration factor associated with them, and improved fatigue lives as a result of optimum heat treatment. A process–structure–property (PSP) linkage has been established to predict the mechanical properties. Experimentally calibrated defects’ based fatigue model has been formulated to predict the fatigue performance using the experimentally observed data i.e. the process induced defects’ size and their locations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Defects; Fatigue; Heat-treatment; Titanium","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Ductility; Fatigue of materials; Heat treatment; High strength alloys; Selective laser melting; Stress concentration; Surface defects; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Fatigue performance; Fatigue properties; High-strength alloys; Induced defects; Mechanical; Mechanical fatigue; Post-processing; Stress raisers; Ti-6Al-4V alloy; Titania; Titanium","","","","","Aeronautics Research and Development Board, ARDB; Defence Research and Development Organisation, DRDO, (ARDB/01/2031951/M/I)","The authors are thankful to Dr. Amit Bhattacharjee, Scientist ‘G’ Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory-DRDO for his meaningful comments and suggestions during the research work.

The effects of preheating temperature on the microstructure, mechanical properties, and corrosion resistance of the LPBF-processed ZK60 alloy are systematically analyzed. The results show that at the preheating temperatures of 35, 90, and 180 °C, the average grain size of the samples does not change much, ranging between 7.0 and 8.2 μm. As the preheating temperature increases, the mechanical properties of the alloy increase. The specimens treated at a preheating temperature of 180 °C exhibit a yield strength (YS) of 201 ± 5 MPa, ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 291 ± 7 MPa, and elongation (EL) of 14.7 ± 0.8%. This is attributed to the precipitation of a large amount of β’1 phase in the alloy during the aging state in the LPBF process. However, the corrosion resistance first improves and then deteriorates with the increase in the preheating temperature. Under a preheating temperature of 90 °C, the corrosion resistance is improved due to the reduction in the galvanic corrosion area by the precipitated phases. When the preheating temperature is increased to 180 °C, the precipitated phases and α-Mg form a large number of microgalvanic cells, which increases the active center for corrosion and deteriorates the corrosion resistance. These findings indicate that the desired mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of the LPBF-processed ZK60 alloy can be obtained by selecting an appropriate preheating temperature. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Corrosion; Laser powder bed fusion; Magnesium alloy; Mechanical property; Microstructure","Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant alloys; Galvanic corrosion; High strength alloys; Magnesium alloys; Precipitation (chemical); Tensile strength; Ageing treatments; High-strength; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Mechanical property and corrosion resistance; Powder bed; Precipitated phase; Preheating temperature; ZK60 alloy; ZK60 Mg alloys; Microstructure","","","","","","","Song J., She J., Chen D., Et al., Latest research advances on magnesium and magnesium alloys worldwide, J.

However, the conventional LAM process usually used high power laser with large spot size, easily leading to high processing costs and overheating of bulk materials. In this paper, a new approach of selective laser ablation assisted milling (SLA-Mill) process for nickel-based superalloys was proposed, in which low power laser with small spot size was used to selectively ablate the uncut surface in front of the cutting tool, resulting in plentiful surface defects emerging. Such defects would significantly weaken the mechanical strength of difficult-to-cut materials, which was different from the thermal “softening” principle of conventional LAM. Thus, the laser ablation effect with low power and small spot size was first studied. The relationship between process parameters (e.g., laser power, cutting speed and cutting depth) and process characteristics of SLA-Mill (e.g., chip morphology, tool wear and surface integrity) was systematically discussed. Moreover, the chip formation mechanism in the SLA-Mill process was indepth analyzed. Results show that the SLA-Mill process is an effective approach for enhancing the machinability of nickel-based superalloys. The resultant cutting force has a reduction of about 30% at laser power of 60 W, cutting speed of 90 m/min, and cutting depth of 0.1 mm.

The HEAs showed an unprecedented strength-ductility combination, especially at a cryogenic temperature of 77 K and a high strain rate of 3000 s−1. Under this testing condition, the yield strength (YS) of the HEAs amounted to 665 MPa. Regardless of the testing temperature, the deformation mechanism of all investigated HEAs was dominated by a synergistic effect consisting of deformation twinning and dislocation pile-up around twins. The fraction of twin boundaries and dislocation density within the deformed microstructure of the HEA correlated with the test temperature. At 77 K, the formation of nanotwins together with dislocation slip prevailed and contributed to pronounced twin-twin and twin-dislocation interactions which effectively restricted the dislocation movement and, hence, contributed to a higher YS as well as strain hardening rate in comparison to that of the HEAs at room temperature of 298 K. The LPBF-fabricated HEAs showed unpronounced thermal softening even at a high testing temperature of 1073 K. Continuous dynamic recrystallization was restricted in the HEA because of its inherent sluggish dislocation kinetics and low stacking fault energy. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Deformation mechanism; High entropy alloy; Impact loading; Laser powder bed fusion","3D printers; Additives; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Deformation; Dynamic recrystallization; Dynamics; Entropy; Failure (mechanical); Iron alloys; Manganese alloys; Microstructure; Piles; Strain hardening; Strain rate; Compressive failure; Deformation mechanism; Dynamic compressive properties; High entropy alloys; Impact loadings; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; Temperature dependent dynamics; Twin dislocation; High-entropy alloys","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11972202, 51905279); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Laboratory of Shockwave and Detonation Physics, LSD, (6142A0320102); National Key Laboratory of Shockwave and Detonation Physics, LSD; Science Challenge Project, (TZ2018001); Science Challenge Project","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51905279 , 11972202 ), National Key Laboratory of Shockwave and Detonation Physics (Grant No. 6142A0320102 ), Science Challenge Project (Grant No. TZ2018001 ).","Song R., Ye F., Yang C., Wu S., Effect of alloying elements on microstructure, mechanical and damping properties of Cr-Mn-Fe-V-Cu high-entropy alloys, J.

The alloy was fabricated using the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) technique. As-printed and heat-treated specimens in their undeformed and tensile tested conditions were analyzed using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) techniques. It was identified that in the as-printed specimen, the retained austenite phase fraction was 26.9%, which dropped to 1.66% following heat treatment. The mechanical test results revealed that the austenite fraction, as well as carbide precipitation, affects the strength and ductility of the LPBF-fabricated H13 tool steel. In order to further investigate the strengthening mechanism, a detailed microstructural analysis of the deformed sample was also carried out. As expected, it was observed that the metastable austenite phase dynamically transforms to martensite. To explain this phenomenon, the Gibbs energy associated with dislocations generated by tensile testing at room temperature was calculated. This stored energy was then compared to the theoretical Gibbs energy needed for the phase transformation to occur. The results show that the Gibbs energy due to dislocation density can explain the observed diffusionless dynamic phase transformation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Austenite; H13; Laser powder bed fusion","3D printers; Additives; Carbides; Gibbs free energy; Phase transitions; Tensile testing; Tool steel; Austenite phase; Austenite transformations; H13; H13 tool steel; High hardness; High toughness; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Phases transformation; Powder bed; Austenite","","","","","McCain Foundation; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Canada Foundation for Innovation, CFI; New Brunswick Innovation Foundation, NBIF","The authors acknowledge the funding received from a McCain Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship , the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI), and the New Brunswick Innovation Foundation (NBIF).","Haghdadi N., Et al., Additive manufacturing of steels: a review of achievements and challenges, J.

Unlike the fusion-based AM processes, CSAM is achieved in a solid-state, bringing several advantages such as the absence of severe oxidation or phase composition changes. At the moment, the main limitation of CSAM is the generally low ductility of the as-sprayed deposits. In this paper, using Cu as a model material, we demonstrate a way to overcome this limitation. Importantly, a high ductility of the deposits in their as-sprayed state is achieved without a trade-off in mechanical strength. Furthermore, we show that without any post-heat treatment, the properties of CSAM Cu are comparable to bulk, non-AM Cu. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Cold spray; Copper; High ductility","","","","","","","","Papyrin A., Kosarev V., Klinkov S., Alkhimov A., Fomin V.M., Cold spray technology, Cold Spray Technol, (2007); Kosarev V.F., Klinkov S.V., Alkhimov A.P., Papyrin A.N., On some aspects of gas dynamics of the cold spray process, J.

Method: In this study, amorphous calcium phosphates micro/nanoparticles (CNP) incorporated GelMA is synthesized by developing specific sites for gelatin structure-based nucleation and stabilization in a one-pot processing. The process ensures homogenous distribution of CNPs while different concentrations of gelatin control their growth and morphologies. After micro/nanoparticles synthesis in the gelatin matrix, methacrylation is carried out to prepare homogeneously distributed CNP-reinforced gelatin methacryloyl (CNP GelMA) polymer. After synthesis of CNP and CNP GelMA gel, the properties of photo-crosslinked 3D bioprinting scaffolds were compared with those of the conventionally fabricated ones. Results: The shape (spindle to spherical) and size (1.753 μm to 296 nm) of the micro/nanoparticles in the GelMA matrix are modulated by adjusting the gelatin concentrations during the synthesis. UV cross-linked CNP GelMA (using Irgacure 2955) has significantly improved mechanical (three times compressive strength), 3D printability (160 layers, 2 cm self-standing 3D printed height) and biological properties (cell supportiveness with osteogenic differentiation). The photo-crosslinking becomes faster due to better methacrylation, facilitating continuous 3D bioprinting or printing.

In this paper, the effects of process parameters and geometrical parameters on the compressive mechanical properties of 316L diamond lattice structures manufactured by laser powder bed fusion were investigated on the basis of actual relative density. The results show that the actual relative density (28.0 % → 25.4 %) and the compressive strength in the building direction (55.7 ± 1.3 MPa → 42.0 ± 1.5 MPa) decrease as the hatch spacing (0.05 mm → 0.09 mm) increases, and they conform to the parabolic function relationship better than the Gibson-Ashby relationship, but the opposite in the XY direction. The actual relative densities and compressive strength inevitably conform to the Gibson-Ashby relationship regardless of the nominal relative densities and cell sizes, and the modulus (857 ± 54 MPa → 1019 ± 51 MPa) increases with the increasing of strut diameter (0.54 mm → 3.21 mm). The compressive strength could decrease slightly with the increasing of contour size (10 mm → 30 mm), while the modulus (964 MPa → 682 MPa) decreases rapidly. To sum up, the process parameters and geometrical parameters could affect the actual relative density significantly, and the actual relative density is the key to correctly analyze the effects of various parameters. The conclusions of this work are helpful to optimize the manufacturing process of lattice structures and design geometrical parameters according to the required performance. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","316L;

In this study, we performed time-of-flight neutron diffraction measurements to investigate the texture and volume fraction of EB-PBF Ti–6Al–4V alloys via Rietveld texture analysis (RTA). The high-intensity neutron source enabled the analysis of the nanosized β-phase precipitates at the α-lath interfaces. The results indicate that the α- and β-textures of the as-built specimen can be ascribed to multiple Burgers orientation relationships among the prior β-phase, α-laths, and nanosized β-phase precipitates, which are not clearly understood. The as-built texture was maintained during post-processing, suggesting that texture manipulation in EB-PBF fabrication is important for controlling the crystallographic orientations of the built components, even after post-processing. RTA allowed a precise quantification of the β-phase fraction, which was found to have increased in post-processed specimens. The results would contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the microstructural evolution of such alloys, which is vital for the modeling and optimization of alloy performance. © 2022 The Author(s)","Burgers orientation relationship; Electron beam powder bed fusion; Phase fraction; Rietveld texture analysis; Time-of-flight neutron diffraction; Ti–6Al–4V alloy","","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (18H05455)","","Murr L.E., Gaytan S.M., Ramirez D.A., Martinez E., Hernandez J., Amato K.N., Shindo P.W., Medina F.R., Wicker R.B., Metal fabrication by additive manufacturing using laser and electron beam melting technologies, J.

The current understanding for the kinematic profiles of each task is limited to discrete time points such as peak knee flexion. However, analyses of the entire movement would better aid clinicians when selecting the appropriate task for rehabilitation or movement screen purposes. The current study used Statistical Parametric Mapping to ascertain differences in the kinematic waveforms for the entire duration of each task. The trunk, pelvis, hip, and knee were analyzed in the sagittal and frontal planes. Data for each variable and task were analyzed from 0–100% of the movement. Primary findings indicated that the FSD provoked a greater magnitude of knee abduction than the SLS and LSD from 26–66% of the movement. The SLS generated the greatest amounts of trunk, pelvic, and hip flexion for the entirety of the movement. The LSD elicited the least amount of ipsilateral trunk lean (90–100%). Thus, the FSD may be optimal for assessing frontal plane knee motion as a screen for injury risk, while the SLS has potential to place increased sagittal plane demand on the muscles of the hip. © 2022 by the authors.","kinematics; movement screens; rehabilitation; SPM","","","","","","","","Ressman J., Grooten W.J.A., Rasmussen Barr E., Visual Assessment of Movement Quality in the Single Leg Squat Test: A Review and Meta-Analysis of Inter-Rater and Intrarater Reliability, BMJ Open Sport Exerc.

Systemic steroids are an effective treatment, but they cause unfavorable and even severe systemic side effects. Discontinuation of systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs leads to relapse, confirming the importance of long-term corticosteroid use. The present study aims to fabricate a mucoadhesive scaffold using three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting for sustained drug delivery in oral mucosal lesions to address the clinical need for alternative treatment, especially for those who do not respond to routine therapy. Methods: 3D bioprinting method was used for the fabrication of the scaffolds. Scaffolds were fabricated in three layers; adhesive/drug-containing, backing, and middle layers. For evaluation of the release profile of the drug, artificial saliva was used as the release medium. Mucoadhesive scaffolds were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and SEM surface reconstruction. The pH of mucoadhesive scaffolds and swelling efficacy were measured using a pH meter and Enslin dipositive, respectively. A microprocessor force gauge was used for the measurement of tensile strength. For the evaluation of the cytotoxicity, oral keratinocyte cells' survival rate was evaluated by the MTT method. Folding endurance tests were performed using a stable microsystem texture analyzer and analytic probe mini tensile grips. Results: All scaffolds had the same drug release trend; An initial rapid explosive release during the first 12 h, followed by a gradual release. The scaffolds showed sustained drug release and continued until the fourth day. The pH of the surface of the scaffolds was 5.3–6.3, and the rate of swelling after 5 h was 28 ± 3.2%. The tensile strength of the scaffolds containing the drug was 7.8 ± 0.12 MPa. The scaffolds were non-irritant to the mucosa, and the folding endurance of the scaffolds was over three hundred times. Conclusion: The scaffold fabricated using the 3D bioprinting method could be suitable for treating oral mucosal lesions. © 2022, The Author(s).","3D bioprinting; Controlled release; Drug delivery systems; Mucoadhesive scaffold; Scaffold","Adhesives; Controlled drug delivery; Drug interactions; Fabrication; Hydrophobicity; Scanning electron microscopy; Targeted drug delivery; Tensile strength; adhesive agent; betamethasone; ethyl cellulose; prednisolone; saliva substitute; 3d bioprinting; Bioprinting; Controlled release; Drug-delivery systems; Folding endurance; In-vitro; Mucoadhesive scaffold; Mucoadhesives; Scanning electrons; Three-dimensional bioprinting; absorption spectroscopy; Article; cell survival; chemical composition; cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug efficacy; drug release; evaluation study; human; in vitro study; incubation time; oral mucosal disease; pH; scanning electron microscopy; slow drug release; survival rate; sustained drug release; tensile strength; three dimensional bioprinting; Textures","","betamethasone, 378-44-9; ethyl cellulose, 9004-57-3; prednisolone, 50-24-8","ZEISS EVO, Carl Zeiss, Germany","Carl Zeiss, Germany","","","Abdalla-Aslan R., Benoliel R., Sharav Y., Czerninski R., Characterization of pain originating from oral mucosal lesions, Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol, 121, 3, pp. 255-261, (2016); Elad S., Zadik Y., Caton J.G., Epstein J.B., Oral mucosal changes associated with primary diseases in other body systems, Periodontol 2000, 80, 1, pp. 28-48, (2019); Fitzpatrick S.G., Cohen D.M., Clark A.N., Ulcerated lesions of the oral mucosa: clinical and histologic review, Head Neck Pathol, 13, 1, pp. 91-102, (2019); Carrozzo M., Porter S., Mercadante V., Fedele S., Oral lichen planus: A disease or a spectrum of tissue reactions?

The L-PBF process was optimized to obtain high density, crack-free components. Specimens for microstructural analyses, tensile and magnetic tests were manufactured under the optimized conditions and tested both in the as-built and annealed (850 °C for 1 h, to relieve the residual stresses) conditions. Tensile tests showed high tensile strength in both AB and HT conditions (larger than those of conventionally produced pure iron), with higher ductility and lower strength after stress relieving. The magnetic study indicated a not optimal magnetic softness although the heat treatment enhanced the permeability and reduced the coercivity with respect to the as-built condition. The high mechanical strength and low magnetic softness came from the very fine grain size (about 5 μm) of L-PBF pure iron. Instead, the improvement of magnetic softness and ductility after heat treatment was attributed to the possible reduction of dislocation density and consequent stress relief. The results indicated the possibility to achieve a considerably high mechanical strength, in pure iron manufactured by L-PBF, although the fine grain size limits its magnetic softness. © 2022, The Author(s).","Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF);

The bead dimensions, the surface finish, the porosity rate and the resulting microstructure were analysed for three different gases (Argon, Nitrogen and Helium) in an industrial L-PBF machine, using rather high energy density promoting keyhole welding regime. No clear effect of gas nature on energy coupling was shown when considering fusion beads on L-PBF parts. However, this work shows that gas, and especially helium mostly modifies surface finish, due to a modification of heat dissipation at the interface between the built part and the powder bed. This effect is clearly beneficial for vertical builds but is balanced by a possible and detrimental reduction of surface tensions for inclined and overhanging surfaces. The data presented here indicates a moderate benefit of He and N2 gases on porosity rates at high laser energy, but the as-built microstructures do not exhibit detectable differences, at the scale considered for the analyses (SEM + EBSD). Some physical aspects of the liquid/gas interface are discussed at the end of the paper to explain the observed results. © 2022","Gas; Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF); Microstructure; Porosity; Surface roughness","Density of gases; Helium; Laser beam welding; Microstructure; Phase interfaces; Porosity; Gaseous atmosphere; Gaseous environments; Inconel 625; Inconel 625 alloys; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Porosity rate; Powder bed; Property; Surface finishes; Surface roughness","","","","","ICMMO-Orsay; Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie, ANRT","Authors wish to thank French ANRT and Air Liquide for supporting and granting the current work.

The study aimed to show that additive manufacturing could be used to fabricate flexural sensors for evaluating the effect of sensor geometry on the sensor output. Prior literature has primarily focused on material optimization rather than geometrical design. The results of this paper show that the signal amplitude between geometrically different flexural sensors with the same footprint can increase ∼28 times. In addition, the bending force is found proportional to the signal amplitude. Thus, concentrating the bending to a small section increases the signal amplitude but also increases the effect of material relaxation broadening the hysteresis loop. This study highlights the importance of considering the geometrical design when fine-tuning additive manufactured flexural sensors. In future work, it is paramount to improve reproducibility, signal linearity, and investigate the effects of geometry on other sensor parameters. © 2022","Compliant mechanism; Conductive polymer composite; Flexural sensor; Material extrusion additive manufacturing","","","","","","","","Liu H., Zhang H., Han W., Lin H., Li R., Zhu J., Huang W., 3D printed flexible strain sensors: from printing to devices and signals, Adv.

However, the additive manufacturing can change the properties of the workpiece due to the strategy of multilayer deposition, which can cause changes in the microstructure of the deposited material. In this sense, this work aimed to evaluate the chemical composition, microstructure, and mechanical and electrochemical behavior of the 316L stainless steel manufactured by wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM), comparing it with a sample of the same alloy in the annealed condition, trying to understand how the different layers interfere in the final behavior of the material. The results indicate that the microstructure of the deposited material is different with the presence of ferrite in an austenitic matrix. Two regions whose microstructure had different morphologies were also identified in the WAAM alloy. In the region close to the fusion line between the deposited layers, the austenite grains are smaller, about 5 μm wide, against 10 μm of the grains in the area most to the center of the layers. This microstructural change caused an irregular microhardness profile, with an average of 276 HV, higher than the 190 HV of conventional material. It was also observed that the WAAM process caused a decrease in the yield strength (YS) (23%) and elongation (78%) of the alloy and a slight increase in the value of ultimate tensile strength (UTS) (9%); however, it still meets the minimum requirements for most industrial applications required for the material studied (min. UTS 485 MPa, min. YS 170 MPa, and min. elongation 35 MPa). Moreover, the electrochemical results in simulated seawater solution indicate that the corrosion potential of the deposited sample is like that of the conventional specimen (about 0.24 V), with the potential passivating of the first to be superior to that of the second, respectively, 0.640 V and 0.560 V. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","316L; Electrochemistry; Mechanical strength; Microstructure; WAAM","3D printers; Additives; Austenitic stainless steel; Electrochemistry; Seawater corrosion; Steel corrosion; Tensile strength; 316L; Deposited materials; Fabrication process; Manufacturing IS; Mechanical; Mechanical strength; Process-based; Ultimate tensile strength; Wire and arc additive manufacturing; Wire arc; Microstructure","","","","","Petróleo Brasil S.

Extruded alloys were powdered using ultrasonic atomization, and then laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) and pulse plasma sintering (PPS) were used to consolidate the bulk materials. A comparison of the properties of the fabricated alloys with those of a conventionally extruded one was carried out using methods that characterized the microstructure and corrosion resistance. When compared to their conventionally extruded counterpart, LPBF and PPS materials exhibited refined microstructures with low enrichment in AlLi and coarse Al, Zn, Mn precipitates. The main drawback of the LPBF alloy, printed for the needs of this study, was its porosity, which had a negative effect on its corrosion. The presence of unrecrystallized particle boundaries in the PPS alloy was also unbeneficial with regard to corrosion. The advantage of the LPBF and PPS processes was the ability to change the proportion of α(Mg) to β(Li), which when the complete consolidation of the material is achievable, may increase the corrosion resistance of dual-structured Mg-Li alloys. The results show that powder metallurgy routes have a wide potential to be used for the manufacture of Mg-Li based alloys. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Corrosion; Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF); Mg-Li alloys; Pulse Plasma Sintering (PPS)","Bedding; Consolidation; Corrosion Resistance; Fusion; Metallurgy; Methods; Microstructure; Powder; 3D printers; Aluminum alloys; Aluminum corrosion; Binary alloys; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant alloys; Fabrication; Lithium alloys; Microstructure; Powder metallurgy; Zinc alloys; Consolidation methods; Extruded alloys; Fusion plasmas; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; Powder consolidations; Pulse plasma sintering; Ultrasonic atomization; Magnesium alloys","","","","","","","Atrens A., Song G.-L., Cao F., Shi Z., Bowen P.K., J.

This is generally caused by the generation of oxidised spatter particles during processing which can contaminate the powder bed, and be incorporated into future builds, ultimately undermining part integrity. Oxidised metal powder often results in porosity, poor layer-layer bonding and detrimental oxides in the printed part. This work uses a new chemical etching approach to remove oxides from the surface of oxidised stainless steel spatter powder. It was shown that a ten-fold reduction in oxide area coverage on spatter powder was possible through submersion in a solution of heated Ralph's etchant for one hour. Oxide removal is thought to occur mostly via dissolution of the metal surrounding and underneath oxide islands on the powder, allowing more aggressive oxide removal. LPBF processing was performed using spatter, etched and virgin powder sieved to an identical powder size range. Etched spatter showed a reduced oxide slag layer on track surfaces compared to spatter. In addition, incorporation of powder into tracks appeared improved after chemical etching of the powder. This work demonstrates that chemical etching has the potential to be used to increase the re-usability and lifetime of spatter or heavily used powder from widely used and corrosion resistant stainless steel powder. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; Etching; Powder; Spatter; Stainless steel","","","","","","","","Bourell D., Kruth J.P., Leu M., Levy G., Rosen D., Beese A.M., Clare A., Materials for additive manufacturing, CIRP Ann., 66, pp. 659-681, (2017); Das S., Physical aspects of process control in selective laser sintering of metals, Adv.

The two main defect types occurring in a build process are porosity, due to insufficient local energy input, and surface bulging, when it is too high. This work adds the ability to measure surface topographies quantitatively and in situ to electron optical imaging. To this end, electron optical images are recorded with a four detector system from melt surfaces fabricated on a Ti–6Al–4V plate. A complete computation chain is proposed, based on a developed model of the imaging process. The model explains the correction of image distortions and the calibrated calculation of the gradient information of the respective surfaces. It becomes possible to reconstruct height maps of melt surfaces by the usage of a suitable normal integration algorithm. The computation chain is validated by the comparison of the resulting reconstructions with laser scanning microscope measurements. Electron optical imaging is able to measure porosity and bulging simultaneously, which allows to gain important process information for process control and the future implementation of feedback control loops. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; Electron beam powder bed fusion; Electron optical imaging; Process monitoring; Surface topography reconstruction","3D printers; Electron beams; Geometrical optics; Image reconstruction; Optical image storage; Porosity; Process control; Process monitoring; Surface topography; Topography; Electron beam powder bed fusion; Electron optical images; Electron optical imaging; Electron-beam; Melt surfaces; Optical imaging; Powder bed; Process monitoring and control; Surface topography reconstruction; Topography reconstruction; Electrons","","","","","FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg; Materials Science and Engineering for Metals; WTM; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (61375930 - SFB 814); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG","The authors gratefully acknowledge funding by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) - Project ID 61375930 - SFB 814 - “Additive Manufacturing” TP B02.

In this work, Inconel 718 (IN718) superalloy was fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) and treated by solution and dual-aging treatments. The δ and γ"" phases with different sizes and morphologies have been obtained by different solution temperatures. The precipitation behavior effect of δ and γ"" phases on the room temperature tensile and high temperature stress rupture properties has been investigated. The results showed that the Laves phase formed in the as-fabricated sample. After solution heat treatment, the Laves phase dissolved and transformed to δ phase. As the solution temperature increased, the needle-like δ phase gradually dissolved, while only a little short rod-like δ phase remained. During aging heat treatment, the Nb element released from dissolved δ phase was beneficial to promote the precipitation of γ"" phase. The content and size of nano-scale γ"" phase significantly affected the yield strength of IN718 alloy. At higher solution temperature, the γ"" phase with suitable size exhibited the highest yield strength of 1283 MPa. On the other hand, δ phase had a significant impact on high temperature stress rupture properties. The stress rupture life increased from 37.2 h to 52.5 h with decreasing volume fraction of δ phase. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Inconel 718; Laser powder bed fusion; Mechanical properties; Phases precipitation behavior","Dissolution; Heat treatment; Nanotechnology; Precipitation (chemical); High temperature stress ruptures; Inconel 718 alloy; Inconel-718; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Phase precipitation behavior; Phase precipitations; Powder bed; Precipitation behaviour; Solution temperature; Yield stress","","","","","Natural Science Foundation for Excellent Young Scholars of Shangdong Province, (ZR2021YQ30); Key Technology Research Project of Beilun District Ningbo City, (2021BLG005); Zhejiang Key Project of Research and Development Plan, (2021C01085); Taizhou Science and Technology Support Plan, (TG202125)","The work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation for Excellent Young Scholars of Shangdong Province ( ZR2021YQ30 ), Zhejiang Key Project of Research and Development Plan ( 2021C01085 ), Key Technology Research Project of Beilun District Ningbo City ( 2021BLG005 ), and Taizhou Science and Technology Support Plan ( TG202125 ).","Sangid M.D., Book T.A., Naragani D., Rotella J., Ravi P., Finch A., Kenesei P., Park J.-S., Sharma H., Almer J., Et al., Role of heat treatment and build orientation in the microstructure sensitive deformation characteristics of IN718 produced via SLM additive manufacturing, Addit.

In this work, we demonstrate a general-purpose adaptive ML-accelerated search process that can discover unexpected lattice thermal conductivity (κl) enhancement in aperiodic superlattices (SLs) as compared to periodic superlattices, with implications for thermal management of multilayer-based electronic devices. We use molecular dynamics simulations for high-fidelity calculations of κl, along with a convolutional neural network (CNN) which can rapidly predict κl for a large number of structures. To ensure accurate prediction for the target unknown SLs, we iteratively identify aperiodic SLs with structural features leading to locally enhanced thermal transport and include them as additional training data for the CNN. The identified structures exhibit increased coherent phonon transport owing to the presence of closely spaced interfaces. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Convolutional neural networks; Machine learning; Materials properties; Molecular dynamics; Thermal conductivity; Active machine learning; Adaptive machine learning; Convolutional neural network; High-fidelity; ITS applications; Lattice thermal conductivity; New physics; Search process; Thermal; Thermal conductivity enhancement; Iterative methods","","","","","Purdue University; School of Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University; Graduate School, Purdue University; College of Liberal Arts, Purdue University, CLA; College of Veterinary Medicine, Purdue University; Purdue Policy Research Institute, Purdue University, PPRI; Hardwood Tree Improvement and Regeneration Center, Purdue University, HTIRC; Purdue Climate Change Research Center, Purdue University, PCCRC; Herbert C.

Next, sodium lignosulfonate (SLS) was adsorbed on the surface and interior of A-PAN through strong ionic bonds to obtain the SLS modified A-PAN, i.e., SLS/A-PAN. Afterwards, copper ions (Cu2+) were chelated with SLS/A-PAN to construct Cu/SLS/A-PAN. The modified PAN samples were characterized by solid-state 13C NMR, FTIR, XPS and SEM. TGA demonstrated that the preferential degradation of Cu/SLS/A-PAN was prone to forming much char residue whether in N2 or air atmosphere, which acted as an effective barrier to hinder the decomposition of PAN matrix so as to exhibit excellent flame retardancy. Additionally, the char residue of Cu/SLS/A-PAN showed numerous intumescent vesicles with continuous wavy-like char layer and its ID/IG value was 1.28, exhibiting superior degree of graphitization. Particularly, compared to the pristine sample, the peak of heat release rate of Cu/SLS/A-PAN decreased significantly. In addition, TG-IR indicated the volatile products of Cu/SLS/A-PAN were significantly reduced. SLS and Cu2+ were cooperative in endowing Cu/SLS/A-PAN with excellent flame retardancy and superior char-forming capability. © 2022","Char-forming capability; Cooperative effect; Copper ions; Polyacrylonitrile fiber; Sodium lignosulfonate","Copper; Sodium; Char residues; Char-forming capability; Co-operative effects; Copper ions; Eco-friendly; Ethylene diamine; Flame-retardancy; Ionic bonds; Polyacrylonitrile fiber; Sodium lignosulfonates; Metal ions","","","","","Beijing Tianjin Hebei collaborative innovation community construction project, (20541401D); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (21975182); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","Funding text 1: The authors are very grateful to the financial supports of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21975182).

The microstructural features, chemical composition and micro-hardness of as-printed and heat-treated Ti6Al4V samples in longitudinal and transverse directions were characterised using optical microscopy, SEM, EDS, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Vickers’ micro-hardness tester. Detailed XRD analysis was performed to quantify the phase volume fractions in the heat-treated samples. The microstructure of the heat-treated Ti6Al4V samples differed from the as-printed samples in grain structure and morphology. The width of α lath increased nearly twice with PHT temperature (from 850 to 1050 °C) in LPBF-processed samples. During PHT under furnace cooling, the growth of α lath width marginally increases due to a slower cooling rate than air cooling. XRD investigation revealed that the presence of β phase content in the PHTs at 950 °C and 1050 °C was consistent. Further, PHT at a higher temperature (i.e. 1050 °C) favours a higher amount of β phase content than the other PHT temperatures. The presence of (002)-closed pack planes was significantly lower for LPBF-processed Ti6Al4V samples, heat-treated under 1050 °C. The heat-treated LPBF-processed Ti6Al4V sample at 1050 °C exhibited a higher hardness (~ 27%) than the as-printed Ti6Al4V sample due to the higher β content among all the samples. The studied PHTs schemes were beneficial in generating the homogeneous and desirable microstructures for distinctive LPBF parts made of Ti6Al4V alloy befitting practical industrial applications. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Aerospace-grade Ti6Al4V;

In this work, highly reinforced Ti6Al4V matrix composites with SiC particles have been additively manufactured by direct laser deposition (DLD). Ti6Al4V powder and SiC particles have been deposited layer by layer to form an additive thin wall structure. The geometry, microstructure, and microhardness of the samples are strongly influenced by the laser scanning speed used during de fabrication process. In addition, the effect of the SiC increment in reinforcement concentrations and the influence of SiC particle sizes in the microstructure have been evaluated, and the reaction mechanisms have been established. The percentage of reinforcement measured is lower than expected due to the reinforcement-matrix reactivity that results in partially dissolved SiC particles and the formation of a TiC and Si5Ti3 ring around them. The size and number of particles and reaction products depend on the initial size and percentage of reinforcement and the DLD scanning speed. The higher the size and percentage of SiC particles and reaction products in the matrix, the higher the hardening effect of the composite matrix.

Furthermore, there is more than one criterion that needs to be assessed to make this selection. In this work, six cellular structures (hexagonal honeycomb, auxetic and Voronoi lattice, and diamond, gyroid, and Schwarz-P TPMS) spanning all three types were studied under quasistatic compression and compared to each other in the context of the energy absorption metrics of most relevance to a designer. These shapes were also separately studied with tubes enclosing them. All of the structures were fabricated out of AlSi10Mg with the laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB. or LPBF) process. Experimental results were assessed in the context of four criteria: the relationship between the specific energy absorption (SEA) and maximum transmitted stress, the undulation of the stress plateau, the densification efficiency, and the design tunability of the shapes tested—the latter two are proposed here for the first time. Failure mechanisms were studied in depth to relate them to the observed mechanical response. The results reveal that auxetic and Voronoi lattice structures have low SEA relative to maximum transmitted stresses, and low densification efficiencies, but are highly tunable. TPMS structures on the other hand, in particular the diamond and gyroid shapes, had the best overall performance, with the honeycomb structures between the two groups. Enclosing cellular structures in tubes increased peak stress while also increasing plateau stress undulations. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; design; energy absorption; honeycomb; laser powder bed fusion; lattice; triply periodic minimal surface","","","","","","BAE Systems, (AWD00034538)","This work was partially supported by an industry grant from BAE Systems, Award # AWD00034538.","Yin S., Li J., Liu B., Meng K., Huan Y., Nutt S.R., Xu J., Honeytubes: Hollow lattice truss reinforced honeycombs for crushing protection, Compos.

This creates a natural conflict between these two criteria at locations where the curvature of the programmed path is small, such as corners, because at these locations it is not possible to precisely follow the path without changing acceleration and, hence, varying the part build rate due to the variation in path velocity. In some additive manufacturing processes it is not possible to easily vary the material feed rate to maintain a constant part build rate when path velocity varies; thus, uneven material deposition occurs. In this work an optimal trajectory smoothing methodology is created that formulates the path following problem as an optimal dynamic system boundary value problem. The methodology naturally allows a trade-off between path following error and velocity error and is experimentally applied in a blown powder direct metal deposition additive manufacturing process. The results show that path and velocity errors increase as the corner angle decreases and the velocity entering the corner increases; however, they can be decreased by increasing the corner's leg length. Further, as the weight on velocity error increases, the velocity error, excess deposited material, and total print time decrease asymptotically while path error increases asymptotically. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Trajectory planning","Additives; Boundary value problems; Deposition; Economic and social effects; Errors; Powder metals; Trajectories; Velocity; Additive manufacturing process; Ceramic pastes; Energy depositions; Freeforms; Material feed rates; Optimal trajectories; Part quality; Paste extrusions; Trajectory Planning; Velocity errors; 3D printers","","","","","","","Ding D., Pan Z., Cuiuri D., Li H., A practical path planning methodology for wire and arc additive manufacturing of thin-walled structures, Robot Comput Integr Manuf, 34, pp. 8-19, (2015); Ding D., Pan Z., Cuiuri D., Li H., Larkin N., Adaptive path planning for wire-feed additive manufacturing using medial axis transformation, J Clean Prod, 133, pp. 942-952, (2016); an J.Y., Y H., zhong F.J., feng G.W., wei L.Z., Optimization of tool-path generation for material extrusion-based additive manufacturing technology, Addit Manuf, 1, pp. 32-47, (2014); Xie F., Chen L., Li Z., Tang K., Path smoothing and feed rate planning for robotic curved layer additive manufacturing, Robot Comput Integr Manuf, 65, (2020); Ertay D.S., Yuen A., Altintas Y., Synchronized material deposition rate control with path velocity on fused filament fabrication machines, Addit Manuf, 19, pp. 205-213, (2018); Han W., Jafari M.A., Coordination control of positioning and deposition in layered manufacturing, IEEE Trans Ind Electron, 54, pp. 651-659, (2007); Giberti H., Sbaglia L., Urgo M., A path planning algorithm for industrial processes under velocity constraints with an application to additive manufacturing, J Manuf Syst, 43, pp. 160-167, (2017); Comminal R., Serdeczny M.P., Pedersen D.B., Spangenberg J., Motion planning and numerical simulation of material deposition at corners in extrusion additive manufacturing, Addit Manuf, 29, (2019); Ernesto C.A., Farouki R.T., High-speed cornering by CNC machines under prescribed bounds on axis accelerations and toolpath contour error, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 58, pp. 327-338, (2012); Imani B.M., Jahanpour J., High-speed contouring enhanced with P-H curves, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 37, pp. 747-759, (2008); Erkorkmaz K., Yeung C.-H., Altintas Y., Virtual CNC system.

Here, a CT-developable orbital stent was manufactured via 4D printing of a shape memory polyurethane composite for enophthalmos treatment. The composite was endowed with good CT development properties via incorporation of gold nanoparticles and nano-hydroxyapatite. Based on the bionic idea and CT reconstruction technique, a 4D printed orbital stent with a bionic honeycomb pore structure and an outer contour matching the orbital coloboma was designed to support the orbital tissue more accurately and stably. CT images of rabbits before and after the 4D printed orbital stent implantation showed better volume-filling capacity compared with the two types of the commercial orbital implants. The three-month follow-up showed the good postoperative result, which demonstrated the excellent performance of the composite in the precise minimally invasive treatment of enophthalmos compared with traditional orbital implants. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","4D printing; Bionic design; CT development; Enophthalmos; Shape memory polyurethane; Volume filling","Animals; Enophthalmos; Gold; Metal Nanoparticles; Orbit; Orbital Fractures; Rabbits; Stents; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Bionics; Computerized tomography; Gold nanoparticles; Hydroxyapatite; Nanocomposites; Polyurethanes; Pore structure; gold nanoparticle; nanohydroxyapatite; polyurethan; gold; metal nanoparticle; 4d printing; Bionic design; CT development; Enophthalmos; Filling abilities; Orbital implants; Orbitals; Polyurethane composites; Shape-memory polyurethanes; Volume filling; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; biodegradation; cell culture; chemical composition; chemical structure; clinical evaluation; coloboma; comparative study; computer aided design; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; cytotoxicity assay; enophthalmic invagination; enophthalmos; eye tissue; female; follow up; four dimensional printing; histocompatibility; implantation; in vitro study; in vivo study; Leporidae; male; minimally invasive procedure; mouse; nanofabrication; nonhuman; postoperative period; volumetry; animal; orbit; orbit fracture; procedures; stent; x-ray computed tomography; Filling","","polyurethan, 61789-63-7; gold, 7440-57-5; Gold, ","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11632005); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (12072094, 82070956, IR2021106, IR2021232)","J.L. thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 11632005 ) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No: IR2021106 ) for financial support.

We propose a systematic method to calibrate experimentally representative heat sources for use in such models. An inverse heat conduction problem (IHCP) methodology is applied to determine the parameters that characterise a double-ellipsoid volumetric heat source, based on temperature measurements taken from the solidification boundary of the melt pool. We demonstrate that these fitted parameters follow well-defined trends across a range of laser powers and scan speeds, for melt pools in the conduction and transition modes typically used in laser PBF. Furthermore, we found that these trends in the fitted parameters are related to the energy density of the scanning laser beam, enabling an appropriate source to be calculated even at intermediate laser powers and scan speeds where calibration experiments have not been undertaken. These results enable a heat source to be selected for conduction-only models that incorporates experimentally calibrated effects such as the laser absorption and the penetration of the vapour depression into the melt pool, which are computationally expensive to calculate from first principles. The approach could also be used to characterize laser PBF systems, for example to monitor the drift in process settings that occur over time. © 2022 The Authors","Experimental heat source calibration; Heat conduction; Laser powder bed fusion; Process modelling","Heat conduction; Inverse problems; Lakes; Laser beams; Temperature measurement; Experimental heat source calibration; Heat sources; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Laser power; Laser scans; Melt pool; Powder bed; Process-models; Volumetric heat source; Calibration","","","","","; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/K030884/1)","This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (Grant number EP/K030884/1 and iCase studentship 16000121 Fast scan to print) and Renishaw Plc.

The wire-arc additive manufacturing is chosen as the demonstrative technology for its manufacturing capabilities suitable for industrial purposes. The scanning path and processing parameters of the simulation are provided via a RS-274 (GCode) file, being the same as the one delivered to the AM machine. The approach is suitable for industrial applications and can be applied to other AM processes. To identify the location in the FE mesh of the heat affected zone (HAZ), a collision detection algorithm based on the separating axis theorem is used. The mesh is continuously adapted to guarantee the necessary mesh resolution to capture the phenomena inside and outside the HAZ. To do so, a multi-criteria adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening (AMR) strategy is used. The AMR includes a geometrical criterion to guarantee the FE size within the HAZ, and a Zienkiewicz–Zhu-based a-posteriori error estimator to guarantee the solution accuracy elsewhere. Thus, the number of active FEs is controlled and mesh manipulation by the end-user is avoided. Numerical simulations comparing the h-adaptive strategy with the (reference) fixed fine meshes are performed to prove the computational cost efficiency and the solution accuracy. © 2022, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; Finite elements; GCode-based simulation; Hierarchical octree-based meshes; Multi-criteria adaptive mesh refinement","3D printers; Additives; Coarsening; Computation theory; Computational efficiency; Heat affected zone; Mesh generation; Numerical models; Thermoanalysis; Adaptive finite element; Adaptive mesh refinement; Gcode-based simulation; H-adaptive; Heat-affected zones; Hierarchical octree-based mesh; Multi-criteria; Multi-criteria adaptive mesh refinement; Multi-Criterion; Octrees; Finite element method","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (872570); Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU, (PID2020-115575RB-I00, RYC-2015-17367); Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO, (CEX2018-000797-S)","The financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in R&D (CEX2018-000797-S), is gratefully acknowledged.

In this study, owing to the enormous workload and alignment problems in the calibration of multiple scan fields, a novel calibration system is designed in this study to realize in situ auto-detection of numerous laser spots in the build chamber to ensure high efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, because the detectable area could not cover the entire build area and the detection data still contained errors, a virtual laser-scanner system was established by identifying the assembly defects and galvo nonlinearities of the ML-PBF system from the detection data, which served as the system's controller to improve calibration accuracy. The multi-field alignment error was less than 0.012%, which could avoid the intersection and separation of scan paths in multi-laser scanning and therefore meet the requirements for high-precision ML-PBF. Finally, the reliability of the method was verified theoretically using principal component analysis. © 2022, Shanghai University and Periodicals Agency of Shanghai University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Assembly defects; Galvo calibration; Multi-laser technology; Powder bed fusion; System identification","Defects; Iterative methods; Laser applications; Principal component analysis; Reliability analysis; Scanning; Assembly defect; Galvo calibration; Laser powders; Laser technologies; Laserscanners; Multi-laser technology; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion; Scanner systems; System-identification; Calibration","","","","","National High-tech Research and Development Program, (2015AA042503); K.

A bimodal grain structure is observed within the melt pool, with the bottom (MPB) exhibiting ultrafine equiaxed grains (∼ 1 µm in diameter) and the top/center (MPT) displaying fine epitaxial grains (∼ 10 µm in diameter). It is demonstrated that primary α-Al(FeMn)Si precipitates act as nuclei for α-Al grains and cause grain refinement at the MPB, thus preventing solidification cracking during processing of this complex alloy via LPBF. The α-Al(FeMn)Si precipitates formed alongside α-Al during solidification extensively decorate grain boundaries and are distributed uniformly within grain interiors. The subsequent aging of the alloy forms densely distributed L12-Al3Zr nanoprecipitates in the α-Al matrix without coarsening the α-Al(FeMn)Si particles. The alloy exhibits outstanding compressive creep resistance in both diffusional and dislocation creep regimes, which is predominantly attributed to the large fraction (∼ 15 vol%) of fine, semi-coherent α-Al(FeMn)Si precipitates that limit the creep flow by restricting both grain-boundary sliding and dislocation motion. With a compressive threshold stress of ∼ 74 MPa for dislocation climb at 300 °C, this alloy greatly outperforms most creep-resistant Al alloys. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Aging; Aluminum alloy; Creep; Microstructure; Solidification; α-Al(FeMn)Si","3D printers; Coarsening; Creep; Creep resistance; Grain boundary sliding; Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; Precipitation (chemical); Solidification; Textures; Bi-modal grain structure; Epitaxial grains; Equi-axed grains; Laser powders; Melt pool; Microstructural development; Powder bed; Ultra-fines; Ultrafine; Α-al(femn)si; Aluminum alloys","","","","","NSF-MRI, (DMR-0420532); ONR-DURIP, (N00014-0400798, N00014-0610539, N00014-0910781, N00014-1712870); Army Research Laboratory, ARL, (W911NF-19-2-0092); Army Research Laboratory, ARL; Northwestern University, NU; Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, Harvard University, MRSEC, (NSF DMR-1720139); Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, Harvard University, MRSEC","Funding text 1: This research received funding from the US Army Research Laboratory (ARL, award W911NF-19-2-0092 ).

Compression and tension tests were performed and compared with finite element analysis results. Moreover, scanning electron microscope analysis for dimensional variation and optical microscope analysis for microstructural changes were performed. Gibson–Ashby relations and related coefficients were also calculated. Results showed that gyroid specimens showed the highest (21.7%) and diamond specimens showed the lowest dimensional error (6.5%). Tensile test results showed that the highest and the lowest ultimate tensile strength were observed on diamond (422 MPa) and BCC (192 MPa) specimens, respectively. Compression test results showed that the diamond had the highest yield stress (427 MPa) and first maximum compressive strength (526 MPa).

One of the solutions to address this issue is the use of recycled PET in some high-end products which may add value to this waste. This study focuses on using primarily recycled PET which has been used to 3D print substrates with fused deposition modeling set up for fabrication of sensors. In this study, after ascertaining the rheological, mechanical, and morphological properties of selected PET waste, a ring resonator was fabricated followed by the fabrication of 3D printed substrates of various infill densities (33%, 50%, 100%). Further vector network analyzer was used to explore sensing capabilities of prepared microchip antenna. The results obtained for recycled PET were compared (at 100% infill density) based upon dielectric constant (εr) as 2.34, with commercial thermoplastics (such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) (εr 2.59), ninja flex (εr 2.90), and nylon (εr 1.02).

This method naturally captures the discrete aspects of additive manufacturing processes, such as material addition. The proposed discrete element framework uses constitutive relations for loose powder, bonding kinematics and the thermo-mechanical behaviour of bonded particles. The mechanical bond interactions consist of beams that interconnect the particles. These beams are able to transfer forces as well as moments. The thermal conductive bond interactions assume an effective conductive area and density to account for the voids in the system. Simulated compression tests reveal that the macroscopic Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio of the bonded material are controlled by only two micro-scale parameters. Furthermore, a heat conducting rod of both powder and bonded material is simulated and compared to a continuum finite element simulation. The proposed discrete model is able to simulate a complete printing process, capturing the solid material behaviour accurately. A simulation of a printed sample shows various additive manufacturing aspects such as: the deposited powder layer, G-code input, heat source interaction, contact, bonding, thermal conduction and the accumulation of residual stresses and deformations. © 2022, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; Discrete element method; Powder bed printing; Thermo-mechanical analysis","Additives; Compression testing; Finite difference method; Heat conduction; Additive manufacturing process; Bond interactions; Bonded materials; Constitutive relations; Discrete elements; Discrete elements method; Particle beds; Powder bed; Powder bed printing; Thermo-mechanical analysis; 3D printers","","","","","Brabant Development Agency; Brainport Industries & Brabant Development Agency; Bureau of Meteorology, Australian Government, BOM","Funding text 1: This work was part of the project/fieldlab Multi Material 3D, coordinated by Industrio B.V. and connected to the Innovation Program Factory of the Future, powered by Brainport Industries & Brabant Development Agency (BOM).

To identify the volume expansion of the aggregate under neutron irradiation, the following analyses were performed for pristine and irradiated α-quartz and meta-chert: X-ray diffraction (XRD)/Rietveld analysis, dimension change, water pycnometry, He-pycnometry, light optical microscopy (LOM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). From the difference of volume expansion observed from dimension change and water/helium pycnometry, the crack opening inside the aggregate subjected to irradiation was elucidated, and this was confirmed by LOM and SEM analysis. The crack contribution to the expansion of the aggregate was significant for neutron fluence > 6.99 × 1019 n/cm2, for E ≥ 0.01 MeV. Based on the XRD analysis, changes in lattice parameters were identified and the cell volume expansion was compared with the data obtained by helium pycnometry. Based on the density change calculation and phase calculation data, the density of X-ray amorphous phase was consistent with that of expanded crystal α-quartz.

This paper sets out an experimental frequency analysis of a rotating, scaled-down, segmented WTB. The purpose of the present work is twofold: (1) to devise a suitable experiment for the modal identification of a rotating component, when no rotor-specific test equipment is available, and (2) to validate a recently developed theoretical model for the dynamics of segmented wind turbine blades, through the modal parameters of the test blade identified for a given range of spinning velocity. The 3D fused deposition modeling technology was used to manufacture the blades segments, assembled with a steel threaded shaft and nut. A speed-controlled motor is used to scrutinize the influence of the rotation velocity on the blades modal parameters. To identify the blades modal frequencies and damping ratios, the eigensystem realization algorithm method was implemented. At rest, the blades natural frequencies were adjusted based on the additional assembly stiffness generated by the nut tightening torque. Because the modal identification of rotating components using conventional test equipment is a difficult task, a significant feature in this paper, beyond the obtained results, is the proposed original experimental technique to investigate the flapwise (out-of-plane) dynamical behavior of the rotating blades. The experimental results are compared with previous theoretical results, as a function of the blades spinning velocity, showing the significant influence of the rotation speed on the segmented WTB dynamical behavior, in agreement with the theoretical predictions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.","Dynamical behavior; Eigensystem realization algorithm; Experimental modal analysis; Rotor dynamics; Segmented wind turbine blades","3D modeling; Equipment testing; Modal analysis; Rotation; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Dynamical behaviors; Eigensystem realization algorithms; Experimental modal analysis; Modal identification; Modal parameters; Rotors dynamics; Segmented wind turbine blade; Test equipments; Vibration behaviours; Wind turbine blades; Wind turbine blades","","","","","","","Jureczko M., Pawlak M., Mezyk A., Optimisation of wind turbine blades, J Mater Process Technol, 167, pp. 463-471, (2005); Beyaoui M., Tounsi M., Abboudi K., Feki N., Walha L., Haddar M., Dynamic behaviour of a wind turbine gear system with uncertainties, C R Mecanique, 344, pp. 375-387, (2016); Greaves P.R., Dominy R.G., Ingram G.L., Long H., Court R., Evaluation of dual-axis fatigue testing of large wind turbine blades, Proc Inst Mech Eng C J Mech Eng Sci, 226, pp. 1693-1704, (2012); Oliveira T.D., Tofaneli L.A., Santos A.A.B., Combined effects of pitch angle, rotational speed and site wind distribution in small HAWT performance, J Br Soc Mech Sci Eng, 42, 8, pp. 1-18, (2020); Sheibani M., Akbari A.A., Finite element modeling of a wind turbine blade, J Vibroeng, 17, pp. 3774-3791, (2015); Maktouf R., Yangui M., Fakhfekh T., Nasri R., Haddar M., Non-linear dynamic analysis of a wind turbine blade, J Chin Inst Eng, 42, pp. 727-737, (2019); Zhao G., Du J., Wu Z., Geometric softening phenomenon of a rotating cantilever beam, Arch Appl Mech, 87, pp. 1049-1059, (2017); Fatigue life estimation of hydrokinetic turbine blades, J Br Soc Mech Sci Eng, 42, 6, pp. 1-14, (2020); Sinha S.K., Turner K.E., Natural frequencies of a pre-twisted blade in a centrifugal force field, J Sound Vib, 330, pp. 2655-2681, (2011); Sun J., Arteaga I.L., Kari L., General shell model for a rotating pretwisted blade, J Sound Vib, 332, pp. 5804-5820, (2013); Hu X.X., Sakiyama T., Itakura K.A., New numerical procedure for free vibrations of pretwisted plates, Arch Appl Mech, 72, pp. 330-341, (2002); Gonzalez-Cruz C.A., Jauregui-Correa J.C., Herrera-Ruiz G., Nonlinear response of cantilever beams due to large geometric deformations: experimental validation, Stroj Vestn J Mech Eng, 62, pp. 187-196, (2016); Larsen G.C., Hansen M.H., Baumgart A., Carlen I., Modal Analysis of Wind Turbine Blades, (2002); Sami S., Zai B.A., Khan M.A., Dynamic analysis of a 5 KW wind turbine blade with experimental validation, J Space Technol, 4, pp. 82-87, (2014); Shi F., Wang Z., Zhang J., Gong Z., Guo L., Influences of wind and rotating speed on the fluid-structure interaction vibration for the offshore wind turbine blade, J Vibroeng, 21, pp. 483-497, (2019); Lopez-Lopez A., Robles-Ocampo J.B., Sevilla-Camacho P.Y., Lastres-Danguillecourt O., Muniz J., Perez-Sarinana B.Y., de la Cruz S., Dynamic instability of a wind turbine blade due to large deflections: an experimental validation, J Mech Eng, 66, pp. 523-533, (2020); Tartibu L.K., Kilfoil M., Van Der Merwe A.J., Vibration analysis of a variable length blade wind turbine, Int J Adv Eng Technol, 4, pp. 630-639, (2012); Dhar S., Development and Validation of Small-Scale Model to Predict Large Wind Turbine Behavior, (2006); Abdulaziz A.H., El-Sabbagh A., Akl W.N., Dynamic and static characterization of horizontal axis wind turbine blades using dimensionless analysis of scaled-down models, Int J Renew Energy Res, 5, pp. 404-418, (2015); Kim S.W., Kim E.H., Rim M.S., Shrestha P., Lee I., Kwon I.B., Structural performance tests of down scaled composite wind turbine blade using embedded fiber Bragg grating sensors, Int J Aeronaut Space Sci, 12, pp. 346-353, (2011); Abdulaziz A.H., El-Sabbagh A., Elnady T., Testing and validation of a novel segmented wind turbine blade, J Test Eval, 47, pp. 3719-3739, (2019); Peeters M., Santo G., Degroote J., Paepegem W.V., The concept of segmented wind turbine blades: a review, Energies, 10, (2017); Bhat C., Noronha D.J., Saldanha F.A., Structural performance evaluation of modularized wind turbine blade through finite element simulation, Int J Mech Aerosp Ind Mechatron Manuf Eng, 9, pp. 930-942, (2015); Saldanha F.A., Rao V.V., Christopher J., Adhikari R., Investigations on concepts for modularizing a horizontal axis wind turbine blade.

Part of the injection information directly reflected by the front facet of the SLs is inevitably hybridized into the output of the SLs and contributes to the state of virtual nodes. For an RC system based on vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), the proportion of the reflected information coupled to the laser output is relatively huge due to the high surface reflectivity. Thus the influence of the directly reflected information will be much more obvious. Using a Santa Fe chaotic time series prediction task and waveform recognition task, we theoretically investigate the influence of high front facet reflectivity on the evaluation of the performance of a VCSEL-based RC system with optical information injection. The simulation results demonstrate that, after taking the directly reflected information into account, a lower error rate is obtained for each benchmark task. The physical mechanism to misestimate the RC performance has been studied through memory correlation and a statistical histogram of virtual node states. © 2022 Optica Publishing Group.","","Reflection; Semiconductor lasers; Transceivers; Computing system; Laser output; Laser-based; Optical information; Optical injection; Performance; Reservoir Computing; Surface reflectivity; Vertical-cavity surface emitting laser; Virtual node; Surface emitting lasers","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61875167); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing, (CSTB2022NSCQ-MSX0313); Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing","Funding.

Thermo-mechanical simulations are used to develop a better understanding of the process and to determine residual stresses and distortions based on the temperature history. In these numerically very complex simulations, modeling assumptions are often made that reduce computational effort but lead to inaccuracies. These assumptions include the omission of the surrounding powder or the use of geometrically linearized material models. The numerical setting, in particular the temporal and spatial discretizations, can further lead to discretization errors. Here, a highly parallelized and adaptive finite element method based on the open source C++ library deal.II is validated and utilized, to investigate some of these modeling assumptions and to identify the required temporal and spatial discretizations for the simulation of PBF of Ti-6Al-4V. The insights initially gained on a simple wall-like geometry are transferred to a larger open rectangular profile where the results of a detailed simulation are compared with those of a more efficient one. The results for the efficient approach show a maximum deviation of ≈ 8 % in the displacements and ≈ 3.5 % in the residual stresses while significantly reducing the computational time. © 2022, The Author(s).","Finite element simulation; Medium fidelity model; Residual stress; Selective beam melting; Thermo mechanical","","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (61375930 - SFB 814)","Funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG,German Research Foundation) - Project-ID 61375930 - SFB 814 - Additive Manufacturing TP C03.

The CH equation has been successfully utilized to model and simulate diverse field applications such as complex interfacial fluid flows and materials science. To numerically solve the CH equation fast and efficiently, we use the FDM and time-adaptive narrow-band domain. For the adaptive grid, we define a narrow-band domain including the interfacial transition layer of the phase field based on an undivided finite difference and solve the numerical scheme on the narrow-band domain. The proposed numerical scheme is based on an alternating direction explicit (ADE) method. To make the scheme conservative, we apply a mass correction algorithm after each temporal iteration step. To demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed adaptive FDM for the CH equation, we present two- and three-dimensional numerical experiments and compare them with those of other previous methods. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Adaptive finite difference scheme; Cahn–Hilliard equation; Stable numerical method","Flow of fluids; Iterative methods; Numerical methods; Phase separation; Adaptive finite difference scheme; Cahn-Hilliard equation; Diverse fields; Field application; Finite difference scheme; Finite-difference methods; Interfacial fluids; Narrow bands; Numerical scheme; Stable numerical method; Finite difference method","","","","","Korea University, KU; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (BK21 FOUR); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","The first author (S.

The ability to tune the L-PBF process parameters to obtain designer as-built surface topography could reduce the need for post-processing. However, the relationship between the as-built surface topography and the L-PBF process parameters is currently not well-understood. In this paper, we derive data-driven models from surface topography data and L-PBF process parameters using machine learning (ML) algorithms. The prediction accuracy of the data-driven models derived from ML algorithms exceeds that of the multivariate regression benchmark because the latter does not always capture the complex relationship between the as-built surface topography parameters and the corresponding L-PBF process parameters in a single best-fit equation. Data-driven models based on decision tree (interpretable) and artificial neural network (non-interpretable) algorithms display the highest prediction accuracy. We also show experimental evidence that thermocapillary convection and melt track overlap are important drivers of the formation of as-built surface topography.

However, the relative low strength and unsatisfactory tribological property are undesired for load-bearing implant applications. In this study, 0–5 at% Si was added to the classic Ti−35Nb−5Ta−7Zr alloy to improve its strength and wear resistance, and the (Ti−35Nb−5Ta−7Zr)1−x−Six (x=0, 1 at% and 5 at%) alloy were fabricated by selective electron beam melting (SEBM) technology. The results indicated that Si addition significantly increases in compressive yield strength, which is mainly due to grain refinement strengthening. At the same time, the wear rate of the as-built TNTZ-5Si alloy in SBF solution was only ∼30% of the Ti−6Al−4V alloy. Consequently, the TNTZ-5Si alloy showed an excellent combination of compressive yield strength, elastic modulus and wear resistance for potential load-bearing implant applications. © 2022, Central South University.","additive manufacturing;

The crosstalk generated by high- frequency multi-pulse actuation waveforms in the piezoelectric printhead has always been considered detrimental and needs to be suppressed, since it significantly limits the improvements of the working frequency of piezoelectric inkjet printing. Herein, the high- frequency multi-pulse crosstalk behaviors in a single nozzle of a piezoelectric printhead were investigated experimentally and numerically. The phenomenon of the droplet jetting state oscillating regularly with the increase of the pulse frequency was found to be controlled by the constructive/destructive interference mechanism of the multi-pulse crosstalk. The maximum frequency for stable droplet jetting could be obtained under the optimal constructive interference. Based on this mechanism, an actuation waveform optimization method via multi-pulse crosstalk modulation for stable ultra-high frequency piezoelectric drop-on-demand printing was explored. The results demonstrated that, under the optimized actuation waveform, the printhead used in this paper, which with a nominal working frequency less than 20 kHz, could achieve controllable and stable droplet jetting even at working frequencies up to 200 kHz. In other words, the jetting frequency was increased by more than 10 times. This work provides a new perspective for improving the efficiency of additive manufacturing processes based on the piezoelectric inkjet printing technology. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Actuation waveform optimization; Crosstalk modulation; Piezoelectric printing; Stable droplet jetting; Ultra-high frequency","3D printers; Additives; Drops; Frequency modulation; Ink jet printing; Piezoelectricity; Actuation waveform; Actuation waveform optimization; Crosstalk modulation; Multipulses; Piezoelectric; Piezoelectric printing; Print head; Stable droplet jetting; Ultra-high-frequency; Waveform optimization; Crosstalk","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12232013, 52025055); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFB1102900); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This study was partially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFB1102900 ), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52025055 and 12232013 ).

Ultimately, θ'/L12 (Al3Zr) co-precipitate formation stabilizes θ' most effectively; however, Zr diffuses sluggishly and has low solubility in aluminum castings. Increasing the Zr segregation rate would allow for faster and more effective θ'/L12 co-precipitation. It is demonstrated that the Zr segregation rate is faster when the Zr matrix content is higher. A much higher Zr matrix content was achieved by rapid cooling during additive manufacturing (AM) that produces θ'/L12 co-precipitation faster, which is shown by scanning transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography experiments. It was also found that Zr continuously segregates to θ' interfaces up to the most aggressive heat treatment studied such that planar L12 precipitates remain after the metastable θ' dissolves. In this manner, we demonstrate that θ' coherent interfaces serve as perfect templates to form stable planar L12 precipitates that can provide strength at higher temperatures than traditional θ' strengthened AlCu alloys. This work introduces an alloy design strategy that uses metastable precipitates to quickly nucleate and grow co-precipitates with a desired geometry that contain slow diffusing elements. These ideas can be applied to engineer more heat resistant alloys by taking advantage of high solute matrix contents enabled by rapid cooling during additive manufacturing. © 2022 The Authors","Aluminum alloy; Atom probe tomography; Elemental diffusion; Precipitate stability; Scanning transmission electron microscopy","","","","","","","","Roy S., Allard L.F., Rodriguez A., Porter W.D., Shyam A., Comparative evaluation of cast aluminum alloys for automotive cylinder heads: part II—mechanical and thermal properties, Metall.

The carbon concentration in this material was kept deliberately low (0.01 wt%) relative to a typical commercial powder composition (0.04 wt%) of IN718 in order to minimize the precipitation of primary carbides during post-processing heat treatments, which have been observed to be deleterious to elevated temperature mechanical properties such as elongation, stress rupture ductility, and notch sensitivity. The final microstructure of the lean C alloy is shown to have a significantly reduced NbC population relative to the baseline material. Furthermore, other microstructural variations such as an increased δ phase population and decreased γ’’ particle size were observed. Empirical observations agreed with microstructural simulations calculated by the ThermoCalc/TC-PRISMA precipitation module. These changes to the microstructure resulted in a 10% increase in the yield strength at both 25 and 650 °C in the lean C alloy, bringing the strength of LPBF-printed material closer to that of wrought IN718. Overall, the reduction in carbon content in the raw material has significant effects beyond limiting the pre-solution treatment precipitation of NbC, primarily by freeing Nb for formation of δ and γ’’ phases. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Inconel 718; Low carbon content; Mechanical properties","","","","","","","","Seede R., Et al., Microstructural and microhardness evolution from homogenization and hot isostatic pressing on selective laser melted Inconel 718: structure, texture, and phases, J.

This work presents a new illuminator based on a previous single-axis polar heliostat. This heliostat allows redirecting sunlight to a specific space to be illuminated at any time of the day. The system presented is simple but compact in size. It has been manufactured by 3D printing with recyclable PETG plastics. Three-dimensional printing has allowed reduction of the mass of the system to less than 5 kg, which means high stability and manageability. Moreover, the system has been provided with an assembly structure that facilitates its correct installation by a single operator. The result is a heliostatic illuminator with an average pointing error of 10 mrad, an acceptable error for urban applications. Finally, a low-cost and high-replicability device has been achieved, which makes it an easily reproducible illuminator and favors its extensive installation. © 2022 by the authors.","daylighting; energy efficiency; energy saving; heliostat","","","","","","Programa Operativo FEDER, (1380888-R)","This research was funded by Programa Operativo FEDER Andalucía 2014–2020, grant number 1380888-R.","Dietz T., Shwom R.L., Whitley C.T., Climate Change and Society, Annu.

A finite element model is established to predict the temperature and melt pool size with considering the thermal-fluidic transport effect. The enthalpy-porosity method is adopted to determine the solid-liquid interface with considering the momentum dissipation during the solidification of the melt pool. A parabolic optical penetration depth (POPD) volumetric heat source model is deduced based on the cylinder heat source model satisfying energy conservation. In the proposed model, the material properties are dependent on the temperature and the powder porosity. The proposed model is validated by comparing to published experimental data of melt pool size. Based on the validated finite element model, the thermal-fluidic transport effects on the temperature distribution and the melt pool are discussed. Results show that in terms of the melt pool width, the prediction accuracy of the surface heat source model is slightly higher than that of POPD volumetric heat source model. In terms of the melt pool depth, surface heat source model is appropriate for the low energy density, while POPD volumetric heat source model is suited for the medium energy density. The thermal-fluidic transport effect increases the melt pool width and length under the surface heat source model, and its effect on the melt pool depth is not obvious. While the thermal-fluidic transport effect decreases the melt pool length under POPD volumetric heat source model, and its effect of the melt pool width and depth is not significant. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Heat source model; Laser powder bed fusion; Melt pool; Temperature distribution; Thermal-fluidic transport","Finite element method; Lakes; Phase interfaces; Porosity; Transport properties; Heat source models; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Melt pool; Optical penetration depth; Parabolics; Powder bed; Thermal; Thermal-fluidic transport; Transport effects; Temperature distribution","","","","","Research Project of Shanghai Collaborative Innovation Center of High Performance Fibers and Composites, (X12812101/024); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai, (21ZR1400600); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52175384); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52175384 ), Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai (Grant No. 21ZR1400600 ), and Research Project of Shanghai Collaborative Innovation Center of High Performance Fibers and Composites (Grant No. X12812101/024 ).","Mishra A.K., Kumar A., Numerical and experimental analysis of the effect of volumetric energy absorption in powder layer on thermal-fluidic transport in selective laser melting of Ti6Al4V, Opt.

It follows pay as per the used model in which the service consumer needs to pay for what they have consumed. Due to the increased dependence on digitalization, the number of consumers and providers tends to grow tremendously. The consumer who needs the service from the provider is not sure about the specified service outcome, and it is too hard for them to monitor and manage the service. Hence, a trusted third party called a trusted cloud broker (TCB) is introduced for managing the services. The service level agreements (SLA) management and reputation estimation framework is proposed, which includes three phases such as (i) SLA establishment between the three parties, (ii) violation detection by comparing the observed value of the TCB and (iii) the reputation and penalty estimation of the service. The novel TCB is created to monitor the deployed services, ensuring the achievement of SLA. The TCB observes the values and estimates the reputation value for each service. It is compared with the provider log-based reputation value and found that the proposed model provides a more precise reputation value for the service providers. © 2022 The Authors.

Methods: Two pairs of antiphase rotary-echo SL pulses were proposed in a new scheme with each pairs sandwiching one refocusing RF pulse. This proposed SL method was evaluated by Bloch simulations and experimental studies relative to three prior schemes. Quantitative R1ρR dispersion imaging studies with constant SL duration (TSL = 40 ms) were carried out on an agarose (1–4% w/v) phantom and one in vivo human knee at 3 T, using six SL RF strengths ranging from 50 to 1000 Hz. The performances of these SL schemes were characterized with an average coefficient of variation (CV) of the signal intensities in agarose gels and the sum of squared errors (SSE) for quantifying in vivo R1ρ dispersion of the femoral and tibial cartilage. Results: The simulations demonstrate that the proposed SL scheme was less prone to B0 and B1 field inhomogeneities. This theoretical prediction was supported by fewer image banding artifacts and less signal fluctuation signified by a reduced CV (%) on the phantom without R1ρ dispersion (i.e., 4.04 ± 1.36 vs. 18.87 ± 4.46 or 6.66 ± 2.92 or 5.71 ± 2.05 for others), and further by mostly decreased SSE (*10–3) for characterizing R1ρ dispersion of the femoral (i.e., 0.3 vs. 1.2 or 0.4 or 0.1) and tibial (i.e., 0.4 vs. 7.2 or 3.2 or 2.8) cartilage. Conclusion: The proposed SL scheme is less sensitive to B0 and B1 field artifacts for a wide range of SL RF strengths and thus more suitable for quantitative R1ρ dispersion imaging in ordered tissues. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","B<sub>0</sub> and B<sub>1</sub> field inhomogeneities; Human knee articular cartilage; Quantitative R<sub>1ρ</sub> dispersion imaging; Rotary echo; Self-compensated spin-locking scheme; Spin echo","Gels; Humans; Knee; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Phantoms, Imaging; Sepharose; agarose; sepharose; adult; Article; dispersion; experimental study; femur; human; image artifact; in vivo study; knee meniscus; knee radiography; mathematical model; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prediction; radiofrequency; simulation; theoretical model; tibia; diagnostic imaging; gel; imaging phantom; knee; procedures","","agarose, 9012-36-6; sepharose, 61970-08-9; Gels, ; Sepharose, ","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R01HD093626); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","This work was in part supported by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under Award Number 5- R01-HD-093626-04 (to Prof. Riann Palmieri-Smith).

In this work, we explore the implementation of an optical scanner in an industrial laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) machine to detect powder bed and part-related defects. The sensor is mounted ”parasitically” on the recoater and exploits its movement to scan across the build platform before and after powder deposition to obtain high-resolution images. The acquisition seamlessly integrates with the process, without delaying the production as the acquisition occurs in parallel with the new layer deposition. The system was used to monitor test builds as well as longer builds (1000+ layers) to prove its robustness to the challenging L-PBF chamber environment. The in-situ powder bed images of the new monitoring system were compared to the acquisitions of a standard external camera setup. The improved image quality and resolution of the new system were demonstrated on both large-scale (>1 mm) and small-scale features. The new system proved to be capable of capturing printed surface topography anomalies and powder bed contaminations (<100 µm), opening a whole new range of possibilities for detecting small-scale defects via in-situ monitoring. © 2022 The Authors","Contact image sensor; Powder bed fusion; Process monitoring; Surface topography","","","","","","","","Grasso M., Remani A., Dickins A., Colosimo B.M., Leach R.K., In-situ measurement and monitoring methods for metal powder bed fusion: an updated review, Meas.

In this study, vascular endothelial cells laden with thermosensitive bio-ink were bioprinted in situ on the inner surfaces of interconnected tubular channels of bone mesenchymal stem cell-laden 3D-bioprinted scaffolds. Endothelial cells exhibited a more uniform distribution and greater seeding efficiency throughout the channels. In vitro, the in situ bioprinted endothelial cells can form a vascular network through proliferation and migration. The in situ vascularized tissue-engineered bone also resulted in a coupling effect between angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Moreover, RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the expression of genes related to osteogenesis and angiogenesis is upregulated in biological processes. The in vivo 3D-bioprinted in situ vascularized scaffolds exhibited excellent performance in promoting new bone formation in rat calvarial critical-sized defect models. Consequently, in situ vascularized tissue-engineered bones constructed using 3D bioprinting technology have a potential of being used as bone grafts for repairing large bone defects, with a possible clinical application in the future. © 2022 The Authors","3D bioprinting; In situ vascularization; Large segmental bone defects; RNA sequencing Analysis; Tissue engineering","Bioactivity; Bone; Cell culture; Defects; Endothelial cells; Repair; Scaffolds (biology); Stem cells; 3d bioprinting; Bioprinting; In situ vascularization; Large segmental bone defect; RNA sequencing analyse; Segmental bone defect; Sequencing analysis; Tissues engineerings; Vascularization; Vascularized tissues; RNA","","","","","Southern University of Science and Technology, SUSTech, (Y01416214); Southern University of Science and Technology, SUSTech","The authors would like to acknowledge the Southern University of Science and Technology for providing excellent testing equipment.

Owing to the excellent strength and high electrical and thermal conductivity of HSHC copper alloy. Moreover, the characteristics of LPBF are suitable for fabricating HSHC. In this paper, the QCr0.8 copper alloy samples with four scanning rotation angles of 0°, 67°, 90°, and 105° were fabricated by LPBF using the high laser power of 2000 W. The results indicate that the scanning rotation angles have no significant influence on the relative density. When the scanning rotation changes to 0°, 67°, 105°, and 90°, the order of the grain size is from large to small. With the 90°scanning rotation angle, the as-built sample has the smallest ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and electrical conductivity. After direct aging, its UTS up to 468.0 Mpa and electrical conductivity is up to 98.3 %IACS. Equally, as a result of precipitation strengthening, the UTS of samples with different scanning rotation angle all increase significantly. This study is to provide theoretical guidance and reference for the selection of scanning rotation angles in the HSHC alloy fabrication process. © 2022","High strength and high conductivity copper alloy;

One of the grave challenges in developing a bioink with superior printability is the constraint of material availability, cross-linking, and other processing parameters that should warrant adequate functioning post bioprinting. This study demonstrates the development of a multicomponent shear-thinning bioink comprising Alginate and Gellan Gum with good mechanical, biological, and adequate printing properties. The addition of two types of silk nanoparticles (SNP), native and regenerated, acted as a reinforcement to the bioink, enhancing its printability. Additionally, silk fibroin solution was added to the bioink that served as a control apart from SNP. The addition of cationic SNP (native) to the anionic polymer mixture of Alginate-Gellan Gum exhibited a remarkable increase in the viscosity, storage modulus and mechanical property compared to the other experimental sets. Molecular characterization studies involving Real-Time PCR, gene expression, immunofluorescence, and histology analysis depicted enhanced chondrogenesis in the bioprinted construct containing the silk fibroin solution. The incorporated SNPs resulted in extracellular matrix secretion towards chondrogenesis of articular cartilage. Taken together, the method's broad applicability is likely to propel the field closer to the goal of precision bioprinting. © 2022","3D bioprinting; Alginate; Gellan gum; Printability; Reinforcements; Silk nanoparticles","alginic acid; biomaterial; collagen; collagen type 1; collagen type 10; collagen type 2; collagenase 3; gellan; hydrogel; hydroxyproline; molecular scaffold; nanoparticle; polycaprolactone; polymer; polyvinyl alcohol; silk; silk fibroin; uvomorulin; Article; articular cartilage; biomechanics; cartilage regeneration; cell adhesion; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; chondrocyte; chondrogenesis; cross linking; crystallization; decellularization; electrospinning; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; extracellular matrix; histology; immunofluorescence assay; nonhuman; regeneration; reinforcement (psychology); scanning electron microscopy; shear rate; shear stress; tensile strength; three dimensional bioprinting; tissue regeneration; X ray diffraction; zeta potential","","alginic acid, 28961-37-7, 29894-36-8, 9005-32-7, 9005-38-3; collagen, 9007-34-5; collagenase 3, 175449-82-8; gellan, 71010-52-1; hydroxyproline, 51-35-4, 6912-67-0; polycaprolactone, 24980-41-4, 25248-42-4; polyvinyl alcohol, 37380-95-3, 9002-89-5; uvomorulin, 112956-45-3","","","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी, (IF160365); Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich, ETH","Funding text 1: JC is grateful to the Department of Science and Technology (DST), India for the Inspire Fellowship (SRF) No. IF160365 .

Besides, considering that the use of position sensor will reduce the system reliability, so the accurate position sensorless method is needed to obtain the stroke signals. In this article, a hybrid terminal sliding-mode observer is designed by combing a second-order nonsingular terminal sliding mode (SNTSM) and a high-order sliding-mode (HOSM) to estimate the back-electromotive force signals of the LOM. The SNTSM surface is selected to ensure that the system state variables can converge in a finite time and the HOSM control law is designed by introducing a variable exponential reaching law, which can strengthen the stability of the observer and greatly reduce the sliding chattering. Since the piston stroke is calculated by integrating the estimated piston velocity, the pure integral saturation will occur due to the presence of dc components in the measured current and voltage. In order to cope with this problem, one self-adaptive band-pass filter is introduced to replace the pure integrator, which can obtain smooth stroke signals with almost no amplitude and phase offset. Moreover, the current amplitude controller is designed to improve the control accuracy and response speed. Finally, comprehensive simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed method.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Current amplitude control; hybrid terminal sliding-mode observer (HTSMO); linear oscillatory machine (LOM); self-adaptive band-pass filter (SABPF)","Circuit simulation; Estimation; Exponential functions; Integrated circuits; Pistons; Sliding mode control; Speed control; Timing circuits; Current amplitude; Hybrid terminal sliding-mode observer; Hybrid terminals; Integrated circuit modeling; Linear oscillatory machine; Observer; Oscillatory machine; Self -adaptive band-pass filter; Sliding-mode observer; Terminal sliding mode; The current amplitude control; Bandpass filters","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51877093); Key Research and Development Program of Sichuan Province, (2021YFG0081)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 51877093, in part by the Key Research and Development Program of Sichuan Province under Grant 2021YFG0081","Li X., Xu W., Ye C., Boldea I., Comparative study of transversal-flux permanent-magnetic linear oscillatory machines for compressor, Ieee Trans.

However, standardized and reliable methods for process development, monitoring and control are still not established. Suitable printing parameters are often determined in a trial-and-error approach and neither process monitoring nor real-time adjustments of extrusion pressure to environmental and process-related changes are commonly employed. The present study evaluates an approach to introduce flow rate as a main process parameter to monitor and control extrusion-based bioprinting. An experimental setup was established by integrating a liquid flow meter between the cartridge and nozzle of a pneumatically driven bioprinter to measure the actual flow of dispensed ink in real-time. The measured flow rate was fed to a Python-based software tool implementing a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) feedback loop that automatically and dynamically adapted the extrusion pressure of the bioprinter to meet a specified target flow rate. The performance of the employed experimental setup was evaluated with three different model inks in three application examples. a) Continuous dispensing: Several runs of continuous dispensing showed that the PID-based pressure control was able to generate a steady flow rate more consistently and precisely than constant pressure settings. b) Adaptation to ink inhomogeneities: Deliberately created ink inhomogeneities were successfully compensated for by real-time pressure adjustments which profoundly enhanced the printing quality compared to printing without adaptive pressure. c) Process transfer to other nozzle types: Experiments with different nozzle types demonstrated the potential of the established setup to facilitate and accelerate process transfer and development. The present study provides an alternative approach for process design, monitoring and control by introducing flow rate as a main process parameter. We propose bioprinting processes to be based on flow rate specifications instead of constant pressure settings. This approach has the potential to save time by avoiding tedious parameter screenings and to introduce an active, real-time control over the printing process. Subjective influences by individual users during process development can be reduced and the process transfer between different devices and experimental setups can be facilitated and accelerated. © 2022 The Authors","3D printing; Adaptive pressure control; Bioink; Bioprinting; Flow regulation; Hydrogels; Liquid flow meter; Process control","alginic acid; arium pro; hydrogel; ink; laponite; nanoclay; poloxamer; polymer; viscoelastic substance; Article; automated extrusion pressure adjustment; calorimetry; dynamic extrusion pressure adjustment; feedback system; flow kinetics; flow rate; geometry; human; implementation science; nonhuman; pressure; process control; process design; process development; regional homogeneity; robotics; shear stress; software; three dimensional bioprinting","","alginic acid, 28961-37-7, 29894-36-8, 9005-32-7, 9005-38-3; poloxamer, 9003-11-6","SpeedMixer; arium pro, Satorius AG, Germany; laponite, Byk, Germany","Byk, Germany; Satorius AG, Germany","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (13XP5071B)","Funding: This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) as project SOP-Bioprint under contract number 13XP5071B .

Thus, the manufacturing of precise components using L-PBF is challenging because of the deformation of the finished products caused by residual stresses. Annealing heat treatment after L-PBF can effectively reduce the residual stress; however, it also reduces the hardness and yield strength of the products. In this study, the deformations of AISI 316 L components fabricated via L-PBF with and without annealing heat treatments were investigated in terms of residual stresses caused by the L-PBF process. In addition, a finite element model was developed for predicting the deformations as well as the evolution of the residual stresses during the annealing process. Cantilever-type residual stress experiments were designed and conducted to quantitatively analyze the evolution of the residual stresses during annealing heat treatments under different conditions. The annealing behavior of 316 L was modeled using the creep material properties. The developed simulation model was further validated using two specially designed components, an auxetic cantilever and a propeller made of 316 L using L-PBF. The developed model could accurately represent the deformations of 316 L components fabricated via L-PBF. In comparison to the deformations measured in the experiments, those estimated by the model showed average error values of only 0.21 and 0.19 mm for the auxetic cantilever and propeller, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Annealing; Finite element analysis; Laser powder bed fusion; Residual stresses","Annealing; Austenitic stainless steel; Creep; Fabrication; Nanocantilevers; Rapid solidification; Residual stresses; 316 L stainless steel; AISI 316; Annealing; Annealing process; Auxetics; Finite element analyse; Fusion process; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; Finite element method","","","","","Advanced Technology Center Development Program, (20008753); Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE; Korea Institute of Industrial Technology, KITECH, (KITECH-EH-22–0009)","This study has been conducted with the support of the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology as “Development of an on-site facility attached cryogenic machining integrated system” ( KITECH-EH-22–0009 ) and was co-supported by the Advanced Technology Center Development Program (Grant No. 20008753 ) funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE, Korea).

The conditions required for producing uniform and compact layers of Nb2O5 from powder material have been studied and optimized. It has been established that ultrafast-laser irradiation, performed in air at room temperature, leads to the formation of dense Nb2O5 layers with the high temperature monoclinic crystal structure (H-Nb2O5) but oxygen deficient. The layers show a preferential crystal orientation with the short axis of the monoclinic structure lying in the structure plane. This preferential orientation can be controlled by the laser irradiation conditions. Anisotropic resistivity has been observed as a consequence of the induced microstructure, while the overall material resistivity is decreased by more than eight orders of magnitude due to the oxygen deficiency. These results indicate that it is feasible to use ultrafast laser processing to promote high-temperature non-stoichiometric niobium oxide phases in a few seconds and with low energy consumption. The highly improved electrical properties of the laser irradiated Nb2O5 layers are extremely interesting for different electronic and sensing applications. © 2022 The Authors","Electrical properties; Laser powder bed fusion; Niobium oxide; Oxygen-deficiency","Crystal orientation; Energy utilization; Niobium oxide; Oxygen; Ultrafast lasers; Condition; Fusion process; Highest temperature; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Oxygen deficiency; Oxygen deficient; Powder bed; Pristine materials; Uniform layer; Irradiation","","","","","Banco Santander, (2017-T2/IND-5465, PR87/19-22613); Comunidad de Madrid, (MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033, PID2020-112770RB-C21, PR65/19-22464); Universidad Complutense de Madrid, UCM","The authors are grateful to the Comunidad de Madrid for support via the Project PR65/19-22464 (Proyectos de I+D para jóvenes doctores) and MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 for the financial support through grant PID2020-112770RB-C21.

The aim of the present research is the one-shot Additive Manufacturing of a low-cost capacitive sensor for liquid level sensing. The Material extrusion (MeX) technology was used to fabricate the proposed sensors (composed of a flexible substrate, two conductive electrodes, and a top flexible coverage), and a Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) approach in conjunction with the 3D printing force analysis was performed. Very thin conductive tracks (0.5 mm) were manufactured to obtain a sensor having a final capacitance value of 125 pF, readable by common laboratory instrumentation. The sensor has been tested for the liquid level sensing using two different liquids, i.e., sunflower oil and distilled water, exhibiting very good sensitivity of 0.078 pFmm and 0.79 pFmm, respectively, with high repeatability, thus obtaining sensing performances comparable with that of more expensive sensors found in literature. Moreover, the proposed sensor showed high linearity (R2 ≥ 0.997), which resulted in a maximum propagated level error of 1.4 mm. The present research proves that the inexpensive MeX technology can be successfully employed for the fabrication of high-performance capacitive sensors: the sensor manufacturing cost (related to raw materials) is 0.38 €, and no manual assembly tasks were performed. This study lays the foundation for the one-shot fabrication of smart structures with capacitive sensors on board, saving manufacturing time and cost. © 2022, The Author(s).","3D-printed sensors; Additive Manufacturing; Capacitive sensor; Liquid level sensing","3D printers; Additives; Industrial research; Liquids; Substrates; Sunflower oil; % reductions; 3d-printed sensor; Extrusion technology; Level sensing; Liquid level; Liquid level sensing; Liquid level sensors; Low-costs; Manufacturing cost; Printed sensors; Capacitive sensors","","","","","Politecnico di Bari","Open access funding provided by Politecnico di Bari within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.

The international community also attempts to protect architectural objects or entire urban layouts, raising their status by inscribing them on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Contemporary museums, however, are not properly prepared to make museum exhibits available to the blind and visually impaired, which is confirmed by both the literature studies on the subject and the occasional solutions that are put in place. The development of various computer graphics technologies allows for the digitisation of cultural heritage objects by 3D scanning. Such a record, after processing, can be used to create virtual museums accessible via computer networks, as well as to make copies of objects by 3D printing. This article presents an example of the use of scanning, modelling and 3D printing to prepare prototypes of copies of museum objects from the Silk Road area, dedicated to blind people and to be recognised by touch. The surface of an object has information about it written in Braille before the copy-making process is initiated. The results of the pilot studies carried out on a group of people with simulated visual impairment and on a person who is blind from birth indicate that 3D models printed on 3D replicators with the fused filament fabrication technology are useful for sharing cultural heritage objects. The models are light—thanks to which they can be freely manipulated, as well as having the appropriate smoothness—which enables the recognition of decorative details present on them, as well as reading texts in Braille. Integrating a copy of an exhibit with a description about it in Braille into one 3D object is an innovative solution that should contribute to a better access to cultural goods for the blind. © 2022 by the authors.","3D models; 3D printing; blind people; Braille alphabet; cultural heritage; recognition by touch","","","","","","Lublin University of Technology Scientific Fund, (FD-20/IT); Technical Information Technology and Telecommunications","The work was co-financed by the Lublin University of Technology Scientific Fund FD-20/IT (Technical Information Technology and Telecommunications).","Elmannai W., Elleithy K., Sensor-Based Assistive Devices for Visually-Impaired People: Current Status, Challenges, and Future Directions, Sensors MDPI, 17, (2017); Pillow B., Banks M., Reeves D., Equal Access for All: Providing for Impaired Stakeholders in a Museum Setting; Skalska-Cimer B., Kudlaczka A., Virtual Museum.

The PDA@CNC hybrid had improved thermal stability and the rod-like morphology of CNCs was well preserved after the PDA modification. The Young's modulus, tensile strength and water resistance property of physically cross-linked PDA@CNC/PVA composites were obviously improved compared with the composites without cross-linking. The improved properties of the PDA@CNC/PVA composites were attributed to the destruction of intramolecular hydrogen bond and reconstruction of intermolecular hydrogen bonds as well as ferric ions coordination cross-linking interactions. The excellent mechanical and water resistance property of the developed PDA@CNC/PVA provides a pathway for the development of water induced-mechanically adaptive PDA@CNC functional nanocomposites for applications such as direct ink writing in 3D/4D printing. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Cellulose nanocrystals; Composites; Cross-linking; PVA; Strength; Water resistance","Cellulose Derivatives; Cross Linking; Hydrogen Bonds; Polyvinyl Acetate; Tensile Strength; Cellulose; Cellulose derivatives; Elastic moduli; Hybrid composites; Hydrogen bonds; Nanocrystals; Neurophysiology; Polyvinyl alcohols; Tensile strength; Cross linking; Dopamine; Mechanical resistance; Modified cellulose; Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA); PVA; Strength; Vinylalcohol; Water resistance properties; Water-resistances; Amines","","","","","Department of Education Foundation of Hebei Province, (QN2020104); Yanshan University Foundation, (BL1903); Louisiana Board of Regents, (LEQSF(2020-23)-R-D-B-02); Louisiana Board of Regents; National Institute of Forest Science, NIFoS; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province, (E2020203063); Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province","The work was financially supported by the Yanshan University Foundation (Grant No. BL1903 , China), Department of Education Foundation of Hebei Province (Grant No. QN2020104 , China), Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province (Grant No. E2020203063 , China), and National Institute of Forest Science (Soul, Korea), Louisiana Board of Regents [ LEQSF(2020-23)-R-D-B-02 , Louisiana, USA].

Methods: In this study, a nanocomposite drug delivery system, that is, hydrogel nanoparticles of an approved nutraceutical, berberine entrapped within vat photopolymerized monoliths, was developed for drug delivery applications. For the fabrication of the nanocomposite drug delivery systems/pills, a biocompatible vat photopolymerized resin was selected as an optimum matrix capable of efficiently delivering berberine from stereolithography mediated 3D printed nanocomposite pill. Results: The obtained data reflected the efficient formation of berberine-loaded hydrogel nanoparticles with a mean particle diameter of 95.05 ± 4.50 nm but low loading. Stereolithography-assisted fabrication of monoliths was achieved with high fidelity (in agreement with computer-aided design), and photo-crosslinking was ascertained through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The hydrogel nanoparticles were entrapped within the pills during the stereolithography process, as evidenced by electron microscopy. The nanocomposite pills showed a higher swelling in an acidic environment and consequently faster berberine release of 50.39 ± 3.44% after 4 h. The overall results suggested maximal release within the gastrointestinal transit duration and excretion of the exhausted pills. Conclusions: We intended to demonstrate the feasibility of making 3D printed nanocomposite pills achieved through the desktop vat polymerization process for drug delivery applications. © 2022, The Author(s).","3D printing; Drug delivery; Nanocomposites; Vat photopolymerization","Biocompatibility; Computer aided design; Controlled drug delivery; Drug dosage; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Hydrogels; Nanoparticles; Pelletizing; Photopolymerization; Stereolithography; Targeted drug delivery; berberine; hydrogel; nanocomposite; nanoparticle; nutraceutical; resin; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Drug delivery applications; Drug-delivery systems; Hydrogel nanoparticles; Multifunctional nanocomposites; Photo polymerization; Polymerization process; Solid dosage forms; Vat photopolymerization; Article; controlled study; cross linking; drug delivery system; electron microscopy; excretion; feasibility study; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; gastrointestinal transit; in vitro study; kinetic parameters; pill; polymerization; scanning electron microscopy; stereolithography; swelling; three dimensional printing; Nanocomposites","","berberine, 2086-83-1, 633-65-8","","","DPRP; Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India; National Centre of Pharmacoengineering, (P/646/2018-19/TDT); Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST","Funding text 1: This work is funded through a National Facility (State-of-the-art infrastructure) project entitled “Establishment of a National Centre of Pharmacoengineering for designing innovative delivery strategies to fight neglected diseases” vide File No: VI-D&P/646/2018–19/TDT by the Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Research Programme (DPRP), Department of Science & Technology (DST), Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India. ; Funding text 2: The author sincerely acknowledges the financial support received from DPRP, DST, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India through a National Facility (State-of-the-art infrastructure) project entitled “Establishment of a National Centre of Pharmacoengineering for designing innovative delivery strategies to fight neglected diseases” vide File No: VI-D&P/646/2018-19/TDT.

The LPBF method, with high flexibility of process control, has shown great potential in making dense components with enhanced thermomechanical properties through in situ microstructure control. In this study, the LPBF method was employed to alter the crystallographic texture of a NiTi shape memory alloy by manipulating the build orientation. The microstructural and phase analyses showed the alteration of NiTi texture from < 001 > preferred orientation to < 011 > direction via changing the build orientation. The test specimens were then mechanically tested under tension, compression, and torsion, while relating back to the observed textures. Comparing the theoretical transformation strains calculated from the lattice deformation theory with the recovery strains obtained from the experiments, the experimental data show a similar trend, but with lower recovery strain magnitudes. In addition to the polycrystalline aggregate, the presence of defects, slip, and retained martensite phases plays key roles in this discrepancy between experiments and theory. The transformation strains showed the highest orientation dependency in tension as compared with compression, whereas this effect was less significant in torsion. © 2022, ASM International.","Compression; Crystallographic texture; Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF); NiTi; Shape memory alloy; Tension; Torsion","Lattice theory; Metadata; Shape-memory alloy; Strain; Textures; Titanium alloys; Torsional stress; Build orientation; Compression; Crystallographic textures; Fusion methods; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; NiTi shape memory alloys; Orientation dependencies; Powder bed; Tension; Binary alloys","","","","","","","Andani M.T., Bucchi F., Elahinia M.H., SMA Actuation Mechanisms, Shape Mem Alloy Actuators., 1, pp. 85-123, (2015); Mehrabi R., Andani M.T., Elahinia M., Kadkhodaei M., Anisotropic behavior of superelastic NiTi shape memory alloys; an experimental investigation and constitutive modeling, Mech Mater, 77, pp. 110-124, (2014); Dadbakhsh S., Vrancken B., Kruth J.-P., Luyten J., Van Humbeeck J., Texture and anisotropy in selective laser melting of NiTi alloy, Mater Sci Eng A, 650, pp. 225-232, (2016); Qiu S., Clausen B., Ii S.A.P., Noebe R.D., Vaidyanathan R., On elastic moduli and elastic anisotropy in polycrystalline martensitic NiTi, Acta Mater, 59, pp. 5055-5066, (2011); Sittner P., Novak V., Anisotropy of martensitic transformations in modeling of shape memory alloy polycrystals, Int J Plast, 16, pp. 1243-1268, (2000); Liu Y., The superelastic anisotropy in a NiTi shape memory alloy thin sheet, Acta Mater, 95, pp. 411-427, (2015); Liu Y., Xie Z., Van Humbeeck J., Delaey L., Asymmetry of stress–strain curves under tension and compression for NiTi shape memory alloys, Acta Mater, 46, pp. 4325-4338, (1998); Shirani M., Andani M.T., Kadkhodaei M., Elahinia M., Effect of loading history on phase transition and martensitic detwinning in shape memory alloys: limitations of current approaches and development of a 1D constitutive model, J Alloys Compd, 729, pp. 390-406, (2017); Somerday M., Comstock R.J., Wert J.A., A systematic analysis of transformation stress anisotropy in shape memory alloys, Philos Mag A, 75, pp. 1193-1207, (1997); Liu Y., Detwinning process and its anisotropy in shape memory alloys, Smart Mater, pp. 82-93, (2001); Safaei K., Abedi H., Nematollahi M., Kordizadeh F., Dabbaghi H., Bayati P., Javanbakht R., Jahadakbar A., Elahinia M., Poorganji B., Additive manufacturing of NiTi shape memory alloy for biomedical applications: review of the lpbf process ecosystem, JOM, 1, pp. 1-16, (2021); Deberg L., Andani M.T., Hosseinipour M., Elahinia M., An SMA passive ankle foot orthosis: design, modeling, and experimental evaluation, Smart Mater.

This work proposes that laser pulses can generate finite amplitude Rayleigh waves for process monitoring during additive manufacturing. The noncontact process monitoring uses a pulsed laser to generate Rayleigh waves, and an adaptive laser interferometer to receive them. Experiments and models in the literature show that finite amplitude waveforms evolve with propagation distance and that shocks can even form in the in-plane particle velocity waveform. The nonlinear waveform evolution is indicative of the material nonlinearity, which is sensitive to the material microstructure, which in turn affects strength and fracture properties. The measurements are made inside a directed energy deposition additive manufacturing chamber on planar Ti-6Al-4V and IN-718 depositions. By detecting the out-of-plane particle displacement waveform, the in-plane displacement and velocity waveforms are also available. The waveform evolution can be characterized (i) for one source amplitude by reception at different points or (ii) by reception at one point by applying different source amplitudes. Sample results are provided for intentionally adjusted key process parameters: laser power, scan speed, and hatch spacing. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; laser generation; laser interferometer; nonlinear ultrasonics; Rayleigh waves","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1727292, W911W6-17-2-0003); , (PTDC/CCI-BIO/29266/2017)","This article is based upon the work supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) under award number 1727292.

Based on the previous work carried out on the IMAGObot platform (a 5 Degrees of Freedom robotic manipulator), the aim is to print on moving and non-planar surfaces, following the trajectory of a fiducial marker placed onto the patient, inside the robot workspace. For this purpose, a monocular vision system (featured by a webcam and fiducial markers positioned in the robot environment) and a software interface communicating with the robot controller were developed. The control algorithm was entirely developed in the Python environment using the OpenCV library for marker pose estimation and used to update the robot trajectory concerning the detected marker motion on LinuxCNC software. Moreover, in order to mimic the physiological displacement of a patient's rib cage due to breathing, a moving 3D-printed platform and a silicone chest phantom were fabricated. The motion compensation system was tested by regenerating a defect on the chest phantom during the respiratory phase through extrusion based in situ bioprinting. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Breathing compensation; In situ bioprinting; Monocular vision system; Moving anatomical defects; Robotic arm","hydrogel; accuracy; algorithm; analysis of variance; Article; bioprinting; breathing; breathing mechanics; breathing rate; calibration; compensation; dispersion; dynamics; heart; human; hypothesis; joint function; knee function; linear regression analysis; measurement accuracy; motion; movement (physiology); noise; pain; parameters; post hoc analysis; rib cage; simulation; software; thoracic cavity; training; tremor; visual feedback; workflow","","","","","Università di Pisa, UniPi","The authors acknowledge the support of the Crosslab Additive Manufacturing of the Department of Information Engineering of the University of Pisa .","Groll J., Burdick J.A., Cho D.W., Derby B., Gelinsky M., Heilshorn S.C., Jungst T., Malda J., Mironov V.A., Nakayama K., Ovsianikov A., Sun W., Takeuchi S., Yoo J.J., Woodfield T.B.F., A definition of bioinks and their distinction from biomaterial inks, Biofabrication, 11, (2019); Wu Y., Ravnic D.J., Ozbolat I.T., Intraoperative bioprinting: repairing tissues and organs in a surgical setting, Trends Biotechnol., 38, pp. 594-605, (2020); Ratcliffe A., Niklason L.E., Bioreactors and bioprocessing for tissue engineering, Ann.

The nearly-dense, crack-free specimens, with and without oxide dispersion strengthening (ODS), exhibit high-aspect ratio grains, aligned in the build direction and with a strong texture: 〈001〉 is aligned along both build direction and laser scanning direction. Creep tests performed at 950 °C, with compressive stresses aligned with the elongated grains (and the build direction), reveal two creep regimes: (i) at stresses below ∼50 MPa, diffusional creep dominates, and the ODS alloy is less creep resistant than the non-ODS alloy, consistent with a somewhat smaller grain size resulting from grain-boundary pinning by the oxide dispersoids; (ii) at stresses above ∼50 MPa, dislocation creep dominates and the ODS alloy is more creep resistant, as expected from oxide dispersoids impeding dislocation motion. When tested perpendicular to the build direction, both alloys have the same creep resistance, which is however much lower than when the stress is aligned with the build direction, reflecting a strong effect of texture and grain shape. After ∼10% compressive creep deformation, grain structure and texture remain largely unchanged as compared to pre-creep structure. © 2022 The Author(s)","Creep; Hastelloy X; Laser powder bed fusion; Oxide dispersion strengthening; Texture","","","","","","","","Ghasemi A., Kolagar A.M., Pouranvari M., Microstructure-performance relationships in gas tungsten arc welded Hastelloy X nickel-based superalloy, Mater.

Traditional repair methods (e.g., welding) cannot always be applied on damaged tools, necessitating complete replacement. Usually, direct energy deposition (DED) is considered and applied to repair tools. In this study, the potential of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) for HPDC tool repair is investigated. LPBF of the hot work tool steel 1.2343/H11 normally requires preheating temperatures above 200 °C to overcome cracking. Therefore, a process window for the crack-susceptible hot work tool steel 1.2343/H11 with no preheating was developed to avoid preheating an entire preform. Laser power, hatch distance, and scan speed are varied to maximize relative density. Since the correlation of LPBF process parameters and resulting build quality is not fully understood yet, the relationship between process parameters and surface roughness is statistically determined. The identification of suitable process parameters with no preheating allowed crack-free processing of 1.2343/H11 tool steel via LPBF in this study. The LPBF repair of a volume of ~2000 cm3 was successfully carried out and microstructurally and mechanically characterized. A special focus lays on the interface between the worn HPDC tool and additive reconstruction, since it must withstand the mechanical and thermal loads during the HPDC process. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; HPDC; insert; laser power; scanning speed; tool repair; tool steel","","","","","","TecNM-CENIDET; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT","The authors thank to CONACYT, as well as TecNM-CENIDET for their financial support through the project “Delimitación de masas sólidas malignas en mamografías mediante un algoritmo de nodos conectados con el menor ángulo polar”.

The results show that the ambient temperature is inversely proportional to the residual stress of the cladding layer, while the substrate thickness and wire temperature are positively correlated to the residual stress of the cladding layer. When the ambient temperature increases from 0 °C to 600 °C, the maximum residual stress decreases by 36.0%, the maximum residual stress increases by 10.0% when the substrate thickness increases from 25 mm to 55 mm and the maximum residual stress increases by 7.48% when the temperature increases from 0 °C to 600 °C. The influence of the three parameters on the maximum residual stress is as follows: ambient temperature > substrate thickness > wire temperature. The research results can provide reference for stress control during actual manufacturing. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; process parameters; residual stress; Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy","","","","","","","","Vrancken B., Thijs L., Kruth J.P., Van Humbeeck J., Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of a Novel β Titanium Metallic Composite by Selective Laser Melting, Acta Mater, 68, pp. 150-158, (2014); Huang W., Kovacevic R., A Laser-Based Vision System for Weld Quality Inspection, Sensors, 11, pp. 506-521, (2011); Zhou C.Y., Luo L., Liu Y., Wu J., Research Status of Additive Manufacturing Technology for Metal, Hot Work.

However, the opposite stiffness requirements for the folding process and the subsequent loadbearing of 3D structures impose an intrinsic limitation in designing self-folding metamaterials: while a low stiffness is required for the successful completion of the self-folding step, a high stiffness is needed for utilizing the folded structure as a load-bearing mechanical metamaterial. Here, we present a nonlinear analytical model of self-folding bilayer constructs composed of an active and passive layer. This finite-deformation theoretical model predicts the curvature of activated bilayers, establishes their stability limits, and estimates the stiffness of folded bilayers, yielding the theoretical stiffness limits of self-folding bilayers. We use our model to identify the optimal combinations of geometrical and mechanical properties that result in the highest possible stiffness of folded constructs. We then compare the predictions of our analytical model with computational results, and validate our theory with experimental realizations of 4D printed structures. Finally, we evaluate the theoretical stiffness limits of bilayer constructs made using the most common types of stimuli-responsive materials. Our analysis shows that a maximum effective modulus of ≈ 1.5 GPa can be achieved using the currently available shape-memory polymers. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Analytical models; Computation theory; Metamaterials; 3D Structure; Bearings (mechanical); Bi-layer; Flat sheets; Folded structures; Folding process; Foldings; High stiffness; Load-bearing; Multifunctional devices; Stiffness","","","","","European Research Council, ERC; , (677575)","The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Research Council under the ERC grant agreement no.

One of the main techniques used to perform these studies is electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Due to the limited measurement throughput, however, EBSD is not suitable for characterizing samples with long-range microstructure heterogeneity, nor for building large material libraries that include numerous specimens. We present a machine learning approach for high-throughput crystal orientation mapping, which relies on the optical technique called directional reflectance microscopy. We successfully apply our method on Inconel 718 specimens produced by additive manufacturing, which exhibit complex, spatially-varying microstructures. These results demonstrate that optical orientation mapping on a metal alloy is achievable. Since our method is data-driven, it can be easily extended to different alloy systems produced using different manufacturing processes. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Crystal orientation; Machine learning; Manufacture; Mapping; Materials properties; Crystal orientation mappings; Crystalline solids; Electron back scatter diffraction; Electron backscatter diffraction; Grain orientation; High-throughput; Machine learning approaches; Materials libraries; Optical technique; Optical-; Microstructure","","","","","Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE, (MOE2017-T2-2-119)","The authors would like to thank Yong Chen Yeoh for producing all the specimens and carrying the EBSD measurements, Ekta Jain for carrying the SEM measurements, and Le Tan Phuc and Wang Yulai for designing and manufacturing the motorized DRM stage.

Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering, Gainesville, 32611, FL, United States","3D bioprinting-focused research is often driven by the aspiration to manufacture functional tissues and organs for implantation, yet decades of additional research is likely needed to develop such technologies, broadly. By contrast, we currently have 3D bioprinting tools capable of generating precise, spatially defined distributions of different cell types that can be used in fundamental and applied research, without delay. Here, we demonstrate this capability by 3D printing adoptive immunotherapy models using KR158B cells (murine glioma), hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and tumor-reactive T cells. We leverage a recently developed material made from packed microgel particles that serves simultaneously as a 3D printing support material and a 3D culture medium. With this approach we create well-defined 3D cell distributions and investigate the interactions between the different cell populations with time-lapse confocal microscopy. We find that 3D printed tumor spheroids containing HSCs recruit T cells more rapidly than those lacking HSCs, where T cell motion appears to be guided by diffusing cytokines originating at the tumor spheroid surface. After the T cells interact with the glioma structures, we collect the different cell populations by running our 3D bioprinter in reverse and perform transcriptomic analysis. We find that the differences in gene expression, comparing tumor spheroids printed with and without HSCs, are consistent with those found in a murine model. These results establish a path forward for developing validated 3D printed models for pre-clinical testing. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Adoptive Cell Transfer (ACT); Bioprinting; Cell migration; Microgel","cytokine; cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4; microgel (material); programmed death 1 ligand 1; tumor necrosis factor; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; cell interaction; cell migration; cell motion; cell population; cell separation; cellular distribution; cellular immunity; comparative study; confocal microscopy; controlled study; dendritic cell; female; gene expression; glioma cell line; hematopoietic stem cell; housekeeping gene; immune response; immunotherapy; KR158B cell line; magnetic separation; molecular diffusivity; molecular dynamics; molecular interaction; mouse; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; polymerization; preclinical study; RNA isolation; spatiotemporal analysis; T lymphocyte; three dimensional bioprinting; three dimensional cell culture; time lapse imaging; transcriptomics; tumor associated leukocyte; tumor spheroid","","","NanoDrop 2000; RNeasy, Qiagen","Qiagen","DEKA; National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Cancer Institute, NCI, (R01CA195563); National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS, (R01NS112315)","Funding text 1: The authors thank Anton Paar for the use of the Anton Paar 702 rheometer through their VIP academic research program.

Despite all the advantages of the method, the quality and the mechanical properties of the manufactured parts are drastically affected by the microstructure and processing parameters. Since the fabrication and characterization of test samples are time-consuming and expensive, developing reliable and accurate models to investigate the correlation between the microstructure and the mechanical properties at the bulk scale is a necessity. In this paper, a three-dimensional geometrical model, which explicitly considers the grains, melt-pools, and melt-pool boundaries, is developed. In this model, first, the grain microstructure is constructed by random Voronoi tessellation of a cubic domain to coincide with reality. Then, considering the melt-pool boundaries’ position and orientation, the redundant portions of the grains are removed. Finally, the complete model is constructed by assembling all the remaining grains. In addition, a method for selecting the randomly distributed grain boundaries and melt-pool boundaries is introduced. The accuracy of the proposed model in considering the texture is validated by comparing the pole figures against those obtained from electron backscatter diffraction tests, and a good agreement is shown. The results show that the pole figures of the model converge to those of the experiment when the number of grains is increased. In addition, some geometrical models are generated by adjusting different process parameters, that is, hatch space, layer thickness, and scan strategy, to see how capable the model is in generating accurate misconstrues. The observations prove that the proposed geometrical model can resemble all the details with good accuracy and can be used for numerical simulation purposes. © IMechE 2022.","electron backscatter diffraction;

To overcome the simplifications used in many existing studies, an enthalpy method is developed for the phase change, and an accurate interface capturing method, i.e., the coupled volume-of-fluid and level set (VOSET) method, is employed to track the moving gas-liquid interface. Meanwhile, corresponding experimental studies are carried out for validation. The obtained numerical results show the formed interface morphology during the process of melt pool with its typical sizes and are quantitatively consistent with those data measured in experiments. Based on the numerical results, the thermodynamic phenomena, induced by the interaction between heat and momentum exchange, occurring in the formation of melt pool are presented and discussed. Mechanisms of the melt pool evolution revealed in the present study provide a useful guidance for better controlling the process of additive manufacturing. © 2022 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Three different configurations were studied. The specimens were made with the technology of additive manufacturing (3D printing) and were made of the same material which is polylactic acid reinforced with flax fibers (PFF). Several tensile tests were performed on four relative densities for each configuration of the composite to understand their influence on the static behavior of the material. Taking into account the insufficiency of the static tests to correctly predict the behavior of the composite, vibration tests were carried out on the same densities and composite configurations. The focus will be mainly on the study of the influence of the 2D lattice structures for each density on the evolution of the dynamic stiffness and damping properties. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","3D printing; auxetic; bio-based; composite; conventional; Damping; flax/PLA; tensile","3D printers; Flax; Linen; Reinforced plastics; Tensile testing; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Architectural material; Auxetics; Bio-based; Conventional; Experimental analysis; Flax/PLA; Static and dynamic behaviours; Tensile; Damping","","","","","","","Allagui S., El-Mahi A., Rebiere J.

However, the control mechanisms of microstructure and mechanical properties of high strength aluminum alloys have not been revealed. To solve this problem, in-situ monitoring of double-wire + arc additive manufacturing process were carried out by the spectrograph and a visual sensor. The spectral signal and arc plasma characteristics under different wire feeding rate ratios were systematically studied. Combined with the high-speed photography results of the droplet transfer, it was found that spectral intensities of Mg I 517.26 nm represented abnormally high during the globular transfer process. Surface bulges with the size of about 100 μm were detected. In addition, the microstructure and phase composition of the deposited parts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results indicated that the variation of electron temperature was consistent with the variation trend of Al2CuMg phase content under different processes. The intensity ratio IRMn/Mg of spectral line Mn I 407.92 nm to Mg I 517.26 nm was proposed to quantitatively measure the degree of phase transformation, which had a better performance than the spectral line intensity and electron temperature. Under the conditions of this research, the phase composition was α(Al) + θ(Al2Cu) + S(Al2CuMg) three-phase when the IRMn/Mg fluctuated around 0.59, and α(Al) + S(Al2CuMg) two-phase produced when the IRMn/Mg fluctuated around 0.35. © 2022","Double-wire + arc additive manufacturing; Droplet transfer; Forming accuracy; Microstructure; Spectral analysis","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Drops; High strength alloys; Magnesium alloys; Magnesium compounds; Manganese alloys; Morphology; Scanning electron microscopy; Spectrometers; Spectrum analysis; Ternary alloys; Wire; Alloy compositions; Control mechanism; Double-wire + arc additive manufacturing; Droplet transfer; Forming accuracy; High strength aluminium alloys; In-situ monitoring; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Real- time; Wire arc; Microstructure","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51875403, 52201048); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2020M670651); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 52201048 and No. 51875403 , China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under Grant 2020M670651 .","Haghdadi N., Zarei-Hanzaki A., Abedi H.R., Sabokpa O., The effect of thermomechanical parameters on the eutectic silicon characteristics in a non-modified cast A356 aluminum alloy, Mat.

However, morphological defects may affect a flexible electronic device's sensitivity, response value, reliability, etc. Therefore, accurate and efficient defect detection is still challenging, especially for mass-manufactured flexible electrodes. This paper proposed and tested a rapid morphological defects detection approach with infrared thermography technology. This approach shows advantages of high detect resolution (minimum test defect: 183.38um), good linearity (R2 = 0.9887), efficiency, and nondestructive and large-scale applications, thereby achieving quality control and process evaluation in the mass additive manufacturing of flexible electrodes. Furthermore, resulting in improves the reliability and consistency of flexible electronic devices. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Defects; Flexible electrodes; Infrared thermography; Sintering","3D printers; Additives; Defects; Electrodes; Flexible electronics; Morphology; Quality control; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermography (imaging); Defect detection; Detection approach; Device sensitivity; Flexible electrodes; Flexible electronics device; Large-scale applications; Morphological defects; Non destructive; Process Evaluation; Sintering","","","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2019YFB1405300)","This research was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (No.2019YFB1405300).","Mu B., Wang X., Zhang X., Xiao X., Laser direct sintering approach for additive manufacturing in flexible electronic, Results Eng., 13, (2022); Liu T., Zhao J., Luo D., Xu Z., Liu X., Ning H., Chen J., Zhong J., Yao R., Peng J., Inkjet printing high performance flexible electrodes via a graphene decorated Ag ink, Surf.

Open cell porous metal foams filled with phase change material are one class of composite in which small changes in morphology lead to large changes in effective conductivity. Regular lattices can be easily built by additive manufacturing techniques, but are often used as simple analogues of composites materials with randomly distributed particles or irregular foams, that can thus be studied using computational techniques. Through procedural steady state simulation of heat transfer through unit cells, the impact of morphology on the thermal response of spheres upon BCC and FCC lattices is quantified. The indices of normalised effective thermal conductivity, microstructural efficiency and morphology factor are given for all volume fractions and conductivity ratio 10−4 to 104. Simple empirical models are developed and are compared to experimental data. Recommendations are made on the most optimal morphology for combinations of volume fraction and conductivity ratio. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Direct Simulation; Effective conductivity; Microstructural efficiency; Morphological efficiency","Digital storage; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Metal foams; Metals; Morphology; Phase change materials; Thermal conductivity; Volume fraction; BCC lattices; Composites material; Conductivity ratio; Direct simulation; Effective conductivity; Effective thermal conductivity; FCC lattice; Microstructural efficiency; Microstructural morphology; Morphological efficiency; Efficiency","","","","","Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province, (E2022203084)","This work was supported by Hebei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. E2022203084) and The Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research through the Project “Department of Excellence LIS4.0 −Lightweight and Smart Structures for Industry 4.0″.

With the significant supply chain issues affecting the electronics industry there has been renewed interest in new ways to reshore and revitalise the electronics manufacturing sectors. A PCA is composed of a substrate, interconnections, passive and/or active components which when combined allow an electronic device to function. These constituents are made of a variety of materials including conductive, insulating and semiconductor. In considering the application of 3D printing (3DP) to the manufacture of PCAs a necessary criterion would be the need for multi-material 3D printing (MM3DP). The aim of this review is to report on the recent progress in the application of MM3DP technologies for the manufacture of PCAs. Emphasis is placed on the realisation of fully automated, standalone MM3DP systems. The review identifies the dominant MM3DP technologies utilised in the industry as well as the limitations of the currently available technologies. Finally, the review proposes five characteristics of the ideal MM3DP system for manufacturing PCAs and discusses the important opportunities for future research in each of the areas. © 2022 The Authors","3D printed electronics; 3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Multi-material","Conductive materials; Electronics industry; Industrial research; Substrates; Supply chains; Thermoelectric equipment; 3-D printing; 3d printed electronic; 3D-printing; Electronic assemblies; Electronics devices; Multi materials; Printed circuit assemblies; Printed electronics; Printing system; Printing technologies; 3D printers","","","","","International Electrotechnical Commission; Sweden's Additive Manufacturing Application Centre, (F42.07.06, TC261)","To move MM3DP PCA manufacturing into mainstream adoption there needs to be sufficient funding and technical resources. Currently there are many examples of initiatives to provide funding and other support. In the US, the Additive Manufacturing Forward initiative has been launched to encourage more manufacturers to utilise 3DP to provision parts and services [41]. The UK Catapult High Value Manufacturing program provides access to funding for R&D and facilitates networking between businesses and research institutions [42]. Two other examples of government supported initiatives would be the German Industrialization and Digitalization of Additive Manufacturing (IDAM) program (present focus is on leveraging metal 3DP) and Sweden's Additive Manufacturing Application Centre. Finally, an important consideration in the advancement of the mainstream adoption of MM3DP PCA manufacturing would be the development of standards [38]. The ASTM and ISO have partnered (to avoid duplication and contradiction) to develop standards for additive manufacturing technologies under the ASTM F42/ISO TC261 committees [43]. Under the main committee there is a specific subcommittee, F42.07.06, that addresses applications of 3DP to electronics. The subcommittee has not published any standards to date. This is not unexpected since the area of 3DP applied to electronics is still in the early stages. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) created the TC119 committee for printed electronics however the focus seems to be on R2R processes [44]. Similarly, the IPC in partnership with several stakeholders created the D60 printed electronics committee where the focus also seems to be on R2R processes [45].An available industrial solution is the FPM-Trinity system produced Fuji Co. which implements a fully automated MM3DP IJP process. The printer can print multilayer PCAs with up to five layers and it is also possible for SMT devices to be embedded in the substrate. The system uses two materials, a UV curable resin for the dielectric and a silver nanoparticle ink with is thermally cured. The materials utilised and the circuit structures produced are comparable to conventionally manufactured PCAs. Numerous examples of printed circuits have been created with research and commercial institutions [94]. Another industrial grade solution is the DragonFly IV manufactured by Nano Dimension. The printer utilises two IJP print heads for processing low temperature sintering silver nanoparticle conductive inks and dielectric inks respectively. A wide variety of dielectric inks are available based on the desired electromagnetic properties (permittivity, permeability). The printing resolution is approximately 10 μm which allows for a significant number of layers in any fabricated PCA [27]. The printer does not seem to allow for automated embedding of SMT components [95]. Where possible, the printing process must be paused to allow for component insertion before resuming. However, the printer materials and supporting software allow for the replacement of SMT passive components with equivalent printed components within the MM3DP PCA.In Section 3.3.1. it was identified that the primary companies involved in the commercialisation of the AJP technology had established partnerships with several system integrators. Two integrated AJP solutions are listed in Table 2. The Cera Printer F-Series is a hybrid 3DP solution which integrates AJP with IJP to process multiple materials in the production of multilayer PCBs [113]. The F-series does not seem to natively support the embedding of SMT components within the body of the printed PCB. The Neotech AMT 15X SA system is another hybrid printer solution which integrates AJP, IJP, DIW and FFF [114]. The 15X SA seems to be geared toward manufacturing 3DP PCAs which are integrated in all three axes compared to more traditional planar designs of conventional PCAs.","Steglich T.A.F., Carry I., Sustainable Global Supply Chains Report 2022, (2022); DuBravac S., The Current Sentiment of the Global Electronics Manufacturing Supply Chain, Industry Report, (2022); Dikler J., Reshoring: an overview, recent trends, and predictions for the future, KIEP Research Paper Wolrd Economy Brief, pp. 21-35, (2021); House W., Building Resilient Supply Chains, Revitalizing American Manufacturing, and Fostering Broad-Based Growth: 100-Day Reviews under Executive Order 14017, (2021); Persad J., Rocke S., A survey of 3D printing technologies as applied to printed electronics, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 27289-27319, (2022); Terms and Definitions for Interconnecting and Packaging Electronic Circuits, (2021); Bailey C., Stoyanov S., Tilford T., Tourloukis G., 3D-printing and Electronic Packaging-Current Status and Future Challenges, (2016); Wiklund J., Karakoc A., Palko T., Yigitler H., Ruttik K., Jantti R., Paltakari J., A review on printed electronics: fabrication methods, inks, substrates, applications and environmental impacts, J.

Herein, sulfur-doped carbon photocatalysts were prepared by a one-step low-temperature carbonization method using sodium lignosulfonate (SLS) as a starting material. The physicochemical properties of the carbon photocatalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and so on. Compared with the carbon photocatalyst derived from alkali lignin, the sulfur-doped carbons from SLS can improve the degradation of tetracycline by nearly 40%. Sulfur species, i.e., sulfone and sulfoxide, can reduce the bandgap and promote the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers under visible light irradiation. The recycling experimental results of S-C-N2-12 illustrate that the catalyst is stable without a remarkable loss in photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline after five successive runs, suggesting that the sulfur-containing species coordinated on the carbon surface are relatively stable. The results of radical-assisted electron spin resonance (ESR) and radical scavenger experiments show that h+ plays a major role in the degrading of tetracycline. These findings suggest that the sulfur-doped carbon photocatalysts have a great potential in pollutant degradation and wastewater treatment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon materials; Photocatalysis; Sulfur-doping; Tetracycline","Carbonization; Degradation; Esca; Experimentation; Lignosulfonates; Sodium; Sulfur; Temperature; X Ray Spectroscopy; Carbonization; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Magnetic moments; Physicochemical properties; Sulfur; Temperature; Wastewater treatment; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Carbon material; Carbonisation; Doped carbons; Higher efficiency; Lignosulfonates; Lows-temperatures; Sodium lignosulfonates; Sulfur doping; Synthesised; Tetracycline; Carbon","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (32071723); Jiangsu Provincial Key Research and Development Program, (BE2020039)","This work was financially supported by Key Research and Development Program of Jiangsu Province ( BE2020039 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 32071723 ).

However, most efforts have concentrated on powder-based techniques, and there remains a dearth of the experimental evidence on the mechanical characteristics and structural behavior of metallic elements produced using wire-and-arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). This article examined the optimal parameters to enable bulk fabrication of thick walls made with a SS410 wire. The objective was to assess the optimized variables utilizing response surface methodology (RSM), followed by the microstructural analysis and mechanical property evaluation. During optimization, the influence of wire feed speed, travel speed, and gas flow rate on bead width and height was determined. Further, the optimized variables resulted in the successful formation of thick walls. Secondly, the microstructural analysis mainly featured the martensite and delta ferrite, with the latter’s percentage increasing with build height. The maximum micro-hardness of 452 HV was obtained at the base of the wall. In addition, the remarkable increases in the standard deviation of micro-hardness represent the great extent of anisotropy in the thick wall. Moreover, the maximum UTS (803 ± 8 MPa) and YS (659 ± 10 MPa) are achieved for the OB sample, which is similar to conventional components. However, the current investigation’s percentage elongation of 5% (max) demands more study before the actual use of the WAAM manufactured SS410 material. Therefore, due to the significant degree of anisotropy and poor percentage elongation, the findings conclude that post-processing is required after bulk SS410 manufacturing. © 2022 by the authors.","mechanical properties; microstructure; response surface methodology; SS410; wire arc additive manufacturing","","","","","","Defence Research and Development Organisation, DRDO, (ERIP/ER/202102001/M/01/1784); Defence Research and Development Organisation, DRDO","Funding text 1: This research work is financially supported by the Defense Research Development Organization (DRDO) under project no.

However, to transfer the research from the laboratory scale to the clinic, it is necessary to produce biocompatible bioinks, that will be safe for both patients and cells used in the bioprinting process itself. The aim of this researches was to produce a bioink that would enable bioprinting of structures with biological material, improving their functionality by recreating their natural environment. The results showed the appropriate physicochemical properties of the biomaterial, which is stable in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies showed the highest functionality of islets (7 days) in the bioprinted cell-printed constructs. The cytotoxicity tests showed the cell viability at the level of 120%. Moreover, the paper presents the first in vivo results for biodegradation of bionic cell-printed constructs. During these studies, no inflammatory reaction to the implanted cell-printed construct was found for 12 months. The appearance of the first neovascular processes was shown in the 8th week of the experiment. At that time, there were no deviations in the level of blood parameters: AST,ALT,KC, IL-6 and TNF-α. Summing up, the created bioink composition is safe for living organisms and contributes to the improvement of the functionality of pancreatic islets. © 2022","3D-bioprinting; Bioink; Biomaterial; Bionic organ; Extracellular matrix; Mice; Pancreatic islets; Tissue engineering","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; bioink; biomaterial; creatine kinase; interleukin 6; platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; biocompatibility; biodegradation; bioprinting; blood analysis; cell viability; controlled study; cytotoxicity; cytotoxicity test; decellularization; Dynamic Mechanical Analysis; electrospinning; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; flow kinetics; function test; Glucose stimulation test; histology; immune response; mass spectrometry; mechanics; microscopy; mouse; MTT assay; nonhuman; pancreas islet; physical chemistry; protein synthesis; scanning electron microscopy; sputter deposition; three dimensional bioprinting; thrombography; tissue engineering; transmission electron microscopy","","alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; aspartate aminotransferase, 9000-97-9; creatine kinase, 9001-15-4","BioX; EM SCD050, Leica; JEM 1400, Jeol, Japan; Pierce; Q800, TA Instruments, United States; TM3000, Hitachi","Hitachi; Jeol, Japan; Leica; TA Instruments, United States","Narodowe Centrum Badań i Rozwoju, NCBR, (STRATEGMED3/305813/2/NCBR/2017)","The National Centre for Research and Development: STRATEGMED3/305813/2/NCBR/2017.","Ji S., Guvendiren M., Recent advances in bioink design for 3D bioprinting of tissues and organs, Front.

Jana Pawla II 78, Kraków, 31-571, Poland","Race analysis performed by faster and slower swimmers enables the definition of effective strategies for carrying out the competition. Until now, measurements of this type were mainly conducted among top-level athletes. The aim of the study was to determine the differences in swimming technique in sprint races between faster (FS) and slower (SS) regional-level swimmers. The performance of 33 swimmers (mean FINA points = 449) competing in 50 m and 100 m freestyle races was analysed. To determine the velocity (v), stroke rate (SR), stroke length (SL), and stroke index (SI), races were recorded with the use of cameras. Using the Student’s t-test and Mann–Whitney U test, the results were compared for two groups: FS (mean FINA points = 557) and SS (mean FINA points = 379). In the 100 m competition, differences between groups were noticed in v (1.70 and 1.51 m/s), SL (2.06 and 1.85 m), and SI (3.52 and 2.80 m2/s), while in the 50 m competition, they were noticed in v (1.95 and 1.73 m/s), SR (59.46 and 55.01 cycle/min), and SI (3.44 and 3.04 m2/s, respectively for the FS and SS groups). Adapting the technique to a shorter distance should be performed by increasing the frequency of movements. At the same time, the decrease in SL should be controlled. The indicator enabling the assessment of technical effectiveness, regardless of the distance, is the SI. The 50 and 100 m freestyle races require specific technical skills to be mastered. Therefore, the development of technique in swimmers should include its various variants. © 2022 by the authors.","biomechanics; race analysis; stroke index; stroke length; stroke rate; swimming","","","","","","Ministerstwo Edukacji i Nauki, MNiSW","Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

By choosing the right printing orientation, the dimensional accuracy and surface quality of the parts can be improved. But also possible to achieve improvement of the mechanical properties by the proper orientation. An algorithm has been developed, which can determine the optimal build orientation based on a numerical simulation for a given load case. The adverse and favourable load directions can be defined according to the layer's position by knowing the anisotropic behavior of the printed parts. The optimal print orientation has been found for four investigated geometries, according to the No-Preference and Weighted Sum multiple-objective optimization methods, and therefore the expected mechanical performance was increased. The algorithm was able to reduce the amount of unfavourable stresses by 100 % for simple beam geometries with longitudinal tensile and compression loads, while the more complex geometries were improved to the best possible extent. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Anisotropy; Build orientation; FEA; Optimization","3D printers; Additives; Finite element method; Geometry; Additive manufacturing technology; Anisotropic behaviors; Build orientation; Dimensional accuracy; Load direction; Mechanical performance; Optimisations; Principal stress; Stress directions; Weighted Sum; Anisotropy","","","","","Nemzeti Kutatási, Fejlesztési és Innovaciós Alap, NKFIA, (TKP2020-NKA-06)","Application Domain Specific Highly Reliable IT Solutions” project has been implemented with the support provided from the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund of Hungary , financed under the Thematic Excellence Programme TKP2020-NKA-06 (National Challenges Subprogramme) funding scheme.","Jiang J., A novel fabrication strategy for additive manufacturing processes, J.

In this article, a simulation algorithm is proposed covering the method of moments and finite difference method (FDM), with the high-speed simulation of the CW illuminator with arbitrary ellipse size, arbitrary loading, and arbitrary polarization direction. Based on the surface electric field equation of the CW illuminator, the mathematical model is established with the vector potential equation and the boundary conditions. In this model, the pulse function and δ function are set as the basis function and the weight function, respectively, for the establishment of the current equation, with the current distribution determined by the simplification equation with image theory and nonuniform FDM. Finally, as the field distribution is determined by the superposition theorem. The simulation algorithm is verified by the self-built CW illuminator.  © 1964-2012 IEEE.","Continuous wave (CW) illuminator; finite difference method (FDM); method of moments (MoM); simulation algorithm","Electric current distribution measurement; Electric fields; Electromagnetic pulse; Finite difference method; Functions; Continuous Wave; Continuous wave  illuminator; Currents distributions; Electromagnetics; Fast simulation; Finite difference method; Finite-difference methods; Load modeling; Method of moment; Simulation algorithms; Method of moments","","","","","","","Prather W.D., Cafferky J., Ortiz L., Anderson J., CW measurements of electromagnetic shields, IEEE Trans.

Because these effects can be related, combining MMP and SFDI may enhance tissue differentiation beyond the capability of each modality alone. Aim: An instrument was developed to combine MMP and SFDI with the goal of testing whether it enhances contrast of features in reflection mode. Approach: The instrument was constructed using liquid crystal elements for polarization control, a digital light processing projector for generating sinusoidal illumination patterns, and a digital camera for imaging. A theoretical analysis shows that the SFD Mueller matrix is complex- valued and does not follow the same behavior as a regular Mueller matrix. Images were acquired from an anisotropic tissue phantom, an optical fiber bundle, and cerebellum, thalamus, and cerebrum tissues. Results: The measurement results suggest that singly scattered, few scattered, and diffusely scattered photon paths can be distinguished in some of the samples investigated. The combined imaging modality yields additional spatial frequency phase information, which highlights paths having only a few scattering events. Conclusions: The combination of MMP and SFDI offers contrast mechanisms inaccessible by each modality used alone.  © 2022 The Authors.

However, the printed parts often exhibit poor mechanical properties due to weak interlayer strength thereby limiting the widespread adoption of MatEx. Improved interlayer strength in the printed parts can be achieved through a combination of process parameter selection and material modification but a physics-based understanding of the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Furthermore, the localized thermal history experienced by the prints can significantly influence the strength of the interlayer welds. In this work, a combined experimental and modeling approach has been employed to highlight the relative impact of rheology, non-isothermal crystallization kinetics, and print geometry on the interlayer strength of printed parts of two semicrystalline polymers, namely, polylactic acid (PLA) and polypropylene (PP). Specifically, the print properties have been characterized as a function of print temperature and print speed. In the case of single road width wall (SRWW) PLA prints, the total crystalline fraction increases due to the broadening of the crystallization window at higher print temperatures and lower print speeds. The results are substantiated by the constitutive modeling results that account for the effects of quiescent crystallization. However, SRWW PP prints display a reduction in the interlayer properties with temperature likely due to significant flow-induced crystallization effects, as suggested by the model. Interestingly, in the case of multilayer PP prints, the repeated heating/cooling cycles encountered during printing counteracts the flow-induced effects leading to an increase in mechanical properties with print temperature consistent with SRWW PLA prints.  © 2022 Author(s).","","3D printers; Crystallization kinetics; Elasticity; Crystallization conditions; Interlayer strength; Print speed; Printing process; Process condition; Process parameters selections; Property; Semi-crystalline polymer; Three-dimensional-printing; Weak interlayers; Polypropylenes","","","","","Adhesive Manufacturers Association","The authors acknowledge the Macromolecules Innovation Institute (MII) at Virginia Tech (VT) for providing a collaborative infrastructure focused across the spectrum of polymer science and engineering research.

In forming, rapid tooling is applied in the production of metallic or plastic tools that guarantee good performance in small- and medium-sized batch production. However, most punches tested to date have dimensions measured in millimeters and are therefore unsuitable for typical real-world industrial processes. In this study, the performance of plastic punches with geometries designed for industrial application was investigated. A deep drawing process involving AISI 304 blanks was created for the manufacturing of cups. Experimental and numerical analyses were conducted to measure the quality of the cups produced and the behaviour of the punches involved. The results indicate that when punch dimensions increase, a more precise cup geometry is produced (99% of drawing depth, 98% of cup precision on the fillet radius, and roundness error equal to 0.53%). © 2022 by the author.","additive manufacturing; AISI 304; deep drawing; polymer punches","","","","","","","","Pansare R., Yadav G., Nagare M.R., Jani S., Mapping the competencies of reconfigurable manufacturing system with the requirements of industry 4.0, J.

Online control methods without reference trajectories are promising for real-time berthing control. We used reinforcement learning (RL), which is a type of machine learning, to obtain an online control law without reference trajectories. As online control for automatic berthing is difficult, obtaining an appropriate control law with naive reinforcement learning is difficult. Furthermore, almost all existing online control methods do not consider port geometries. This study proposes a method for obtaining online berthing control laws by combining supervised learning (SL) and RL. We first trained the controller using offline-calculated trajectories and then further trained it using RL. Owing to the SL process, the proposed method can start the RL process with a good control policy. We evaluated the control law performance of the proposed method in a simulation environment that considered port geometries and wind disturbances. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve a higher success rate and lower safety risk than the naive SL and RL algorithms. © 2022 The Author(s)","Automatic berthing/docking; Autonomous vessel; Reinforcement learning; Supervised learning","Control theory; E-learning; Environmental regulations; Process control; Supervised learning; Trajectories; Automatic berthing/docking; Autonomous vessel; Control laws; Control methods; Learning process; Off-line optimization; On-line controls; Optimization control; Reference trajectories; Reinforcement learnings; mooring system; port operation; reinforcement; supervised learning; vessel; Reinforcement learning","","","","","Japan Society for Promotion of Science, Japan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (23K22970, 19K04858, 22H01701)","This study was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Japan Society for Promotion of Science, Japan (JSPS KAKENHI Grant #19K04858 , #22H01701 ).

The optimization of bioinks as per requirements for specific tissue applications is an essential exercise in ensuring clinical translation of the bioprinting technologies. Most notably, optimum hydrogel polymer concentrations are required to ensure adequate mechanical properties of bioprinted constructs without causing significant shear stresses on cells. However, experimental iterations are often tedious for optimizing the bioink properties. In this work, a nonlinear finite element modeling approach has been undertaken to determine the effect of different bioink parameters such as composition, concentration on the range of stresses being experienced by the cells in the bioprinted construct. The stress distribution of the cells at different parts of the constructs has also been modeled. It is found that both bioink chemical compositions and concentrations can substantially alter the stress effects experienced by the cells. Concentrated regions of softer cells near pore regions were found to increase stress concentrations by almost three times compared with stress generated in cells away from the pores. The study provides a method for rapid optimization of bioinks, design of bioprinted constructs, as well as toolpath plans for fabricating constructs with homogenous properties.

This drives up demand for electronic materials with excellent process ability and functionality from one-step molding of microminiature to large-scale devices. Herein, a novel method is introduced for fabricating high-performance barium titanate (BaTiO3)-polydimethylsiloxane composites based on three-dimensional (3D)-printing-ordered structure of a metamaterial skeleton. When subjected to external mechanical stress, the metamaterial structure facilitates effective stress transfer, resulting in a significantly improved voltage output. In comparison to traditional low-dimensional ceramic polymer composites, metamaterial-structured BaTiO3 composites exhibit excellent electromechanical energy conversion properties, thereby enabling tactile imitation applications and mechanical energy harvesting.

This method allows direct layer by layer deposition of metallic materials with good interlayer adhesion without formation of internal oxides. The double-layered materials including metal 1/metal 2, crystalline alloy 1/crystalline alloy 2 and crystalline alloy/glassy (amorphous) alloy were produced. The resulting materials consist of a combination of a relatively hard layer 1 and a relatively soft layer 2, thus making an in-situ layered composite “inlaycom”. The obtained structures were examined by X-ray diffractometry and scanning electron microscopy. The paper is focused to show the principle of the process usable as a scientific instrument.

Simulating eutectic Si phase formation has been a challenge in ICME (integrated computational materials engineering) based design and manufacturing of solidification products of Al-Si-based alloys. In this study, our previous three-dimensional (3-D) cellular automaton (CA) model for α-Al dendritic growth was extended to include eutectic (α-Al + Si) transformation in multi-dendrite domains, providing a complete solidification simulation of critically important Al-Si based alloys. The quantitative results of the Si phase in the eutectic microstructure were experimentally validated using scanning electron microscopy and deep etching techniques. The simulation results show a good agreement with the experimental observations and calculations by the Scheil model and lever rule. This 3-D CA model is useful for predicting and optimizing the solidification microstructure including eutectic transformation during solidification processing such as casting, potentially welding, and additive manufacturing. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Aluminum alloys; Cellular automata; Etching; Eutectics; Microstructure; Morphology; Product design; Scanning electron microscopy; Silicon alloys; Cellular automata models; Cellular automata simulations; Eutectic si; Eutectic silicon; Eutectic transformation; Experimental validations; Performance; Si-based; Simulation validation; Solidification microstructures; Solidification","","","","","Simulation Innovation and Modeling Center; Ohio State University, OSU; National Science Foundation, NSF, (CMMI-1432688, CMMI-1432688)","The authors would like to acknowledge the United States National Science Foundation for supporting this work (Award CMMI-1432688).

The surface quality of L-PBF components is traditionally improved through mechanical polishing. However, in recent years, laser polishing (LP), in which laser radiation is used to melt a thin layer of metal on the component surface, has attracted increasing attention. Accordingly, a simulation model is considered the potential approach to explore insights into the process and to optimize the LP processing conditions. Previous studies which focus on building simulation for the LP process neglected the effect of the initial surface profile on the absorption of laser energy as laser irradiates the surface. In an effort to address this issue and to create a foundation for optimizing the processing conditions in LP, in this work, a new computational framework is proposed for predicting the surface profile of L-PBF parts following the LP process. For taking into account the effect of initial L-PBF processed roughness on the laser absorption, the proposed approach commences by using a mathematical model to reconstruct the measured surface profile of the printed part. Ray-tracing simulations are then performed to investigate the interaction between the laser radiation and the surface profile and to evaluate the absorption of the metal surface. Finally, heat transfer simulations, fast Fourier transform analyses, and a low-pass filter algorithm are employed to simulate the final surface profile of the L-PBF component following laser polishing. It is found that the predicted values of mean roughness (Ra) and root mean square (Rq) differ from experiment by no more than 7.7% and 9.8%, respectively. Additionally, the simulated correlation length (cl) which is the parameter illustrating the variation of height in the lateral direction is also compared with one attained from experiment. It is observed that the maximum error between simulated correlation length and one attained from the experiment is no more than 13.4%. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Laser polishing; Laser powder bed fusion process; Ray tracing; Surface roughness","Fast Fourier transforms; Laser radiation; Low pass filters; Polishing; Powder metals; Ray tracing; Stainless steel; Computational framework; Fusion components; Fusion process; Laser polishing; Laser powder bed fusion process; Laser powders; Polishing processs; Powder bed; Processing condition; Surface profiles; Surface roughness","","","","","National Science and Technology Council of Taiwan; Ministry of Education, MOE; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (110-2222-E-218-002-MY2, 110-2622-E-218-005); National Cheng Kung University, NCKU; Intelligent Manufacturing Research Center, iMRC; Institute for Information Industry, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, III, (MOST 110-2222-E-218-002-MY2)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided to this study by the National Science and Technology Council of Taiwan Under Grant No. MOST 110-2222-E-218-002-MY2 and MOST 110-2622-E-218-005.

Even more complex processes are required to prepare graphene-based nanohybrids, which offer additional synergistic functionalities in relation to graphene. Here, an uncomplicated and scalable process to prepare high-purity few-layer turbostratic graphene and graphene/SiOx nanohybrids is demonstrated employing laser-mediated explosive synthesis and transfer of graphene flakes. The process is capable of producing, and simultaneously transferring, graphene flakes on any substrate, such as polymer, glass, metal, ceramics, etc. Graphene and nanohybrids exhibit sp2 structures of turbostratic stacking, with low sheet resistance and very high (~30) C/O ratio. The merits of the method are showcased by two energy-related examples, flexible single-electrode triboelectric nanogenerators and electric double-layer capacitors. This method emerges as a paradigm of additive manufacturing for graphene-based devices with impact for applications in flexible electronics. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Energy conversion; Explosives; Flexible electronics; Nanostructured materials; Sheet metal; Complex Processes; Explosive synthesis; Graphene likes; High grades; Laser-assisted; Nanohybrids; Simple++; Simultaneous transfer; Soft surface; Turbostratic; Graphene","","","","","Operational Programme Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, (NSRF 2014-2020); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (721642); H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA; European Commission, EC; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","This research was partly supported by the project ‘National Infrastructure in Nanotechnology, Advanced Materials and Micro-/ Nanoelectronics’ (MIS 5002772) which is implemented under the Action Reinforcement of the Research and Innovation Infrastructure, funded by the Operational Programme Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation (NSRF 2014-2020) and co-financed by Greece and the European Union (European Regional Development Fund).

Generally, a local equilibrium assumption is used in which the retardation factor is derived from aquifer material and contaminant type. However, for problems involving faster seepage velocities, this assumption becomes invalid and the mass transfer between mobile and immobile or, sorbed phases of contaminant becomes rate-limited. Traditionally, finite difference method (FDM) models are employed for contaminant transport simulation with rate-limited adsorption (RLA). Nonetheless, due to the presence of a grid, these models show instabilities, especially for advection dominant problems. In the present study, a meshless Radial Point Collocation Method (RPCM-RLA) is proposed for contaminant transport simulation with rate-limited adsorption. The proposed model is verified with semi-analytical solutions and its efficacy is assessed with the popularly used FDM-based Reactive Transport in 3 Dimensions (RT3D) model. The RPCM-RLA model is observed to provide stable and accurate solutions even for advection dominant problems whereas RT3D model simulations show excessive numerical dispersion. Furthermore, the effectiveness of RPCM-RLA model is demonstrated in two case studies concerning heterogeneous unconfined aquifers by comparing it with RT3D. Both model simulations agree consistently with maximum values of normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) being 0.0055 and 0.031 for case studies 1 and 2 respectively, with better performance of RPCM-RLA model. © 2022","Aquifer heterogeneity; Meshless model; Point collocation method; Radial basis function; Rate limited adsorption","Adsorption; Advection; Aquifers; Contamination; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Mass transfer; Radial basis function networks; Aquifer heterogeneity; Base function; Contaminants transport; Meshless model; Point collocation method; Radial base function; Radial basis; Rate-limited adsorption; Reactive transport; Transport simulation; Finite difference method","","","","","Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences, BRNS, (16BRNS002); Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences, BRNS","The authors thank the Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences (BRNS) for providing support through the project “Modelling of reactive transport in groundwater using meshfree based numerical methods” (Project no. 16BRNS002).

The modification leads to a wide spurious-free stopband, which is highly desirable for channel separation in waveguide contiguous output multiplexers (OMUXs) in satellite communication systems. The new resonant cavity design is a result of applying shape deformation to a basic circular cavity in order to move away and suppress parasitic modes. A fourth-order Ku-band channel filter with two transmission zeros (TZs) is designed, fabricated by additive manufacturing (AM) in one piece and measured. In comparison with the state-of-the-art design of a stepped CWDM filter, an improvement of approximately 35% wider spurious-free range is achieved.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Additive manufacturing (AM); dual-mode waveguide filters; output multiplexer (OMUX); shape deformation","Bandpass filters; Circular waveguides; Deformation; Microwave filters; Q factor measurement; Satellite communication systems; Waveguide filters; Additive manufacturing; Dual-mode filter; Dual-mode waveguide filters; Microwave communications; Output multiplexer; Output multiplexers; Q-factors; Shape; Shape deformation; Wide-band; 3D printers","","","","","European Space Agency, ESA, (4000128097/19/NL/CBi); Narodowe Centrum Nauki, NCN, (2020/39/O/ST7/02897)","This work was supported in part by the National Science Centre, Poland, under Agreement 2020/39/O/ST7/02897; and in part by the European Space Agency under Contract 4000128097/19/NL/CBi.","Kudsia C., Cameron R., Tang W.-W., Innovations in microwave filters and multiplexing networks for communications satellite systems, IEEE Trans.

For instance, 3D-printed concrete (3DPC) is revolutionizing the construction sector with a promise to cut projects’ costs and time. Therefore, 3DPC has been subjected to extensive research and development to optimize the mechanical and thermal performance of concrete walls produced by 3D printing. In this paper, we conduct a comparative investigation of the thermal performance of various infill structures of 3DPC walls. The targeted outcome is to produce an infill structure with optimized thermal performance to reduce building energy consumption without incurring additional material costs. Accordingly, a computational model is developed to simulate the thermal behavior of various infill structures that can be used for 3DPC walls. The concrete composition and the concrete-to-void fraction are maintained constant to focus on the impact of the infill structure (geometric variations). The thermal performance and energy-saving potential of the 3DPC walls are compared with conventional construction materials, including clay and concrete bricks. The results show that changing the infill structure of the 3DPC walls influences the walls’ thermal conductivity and, thereby, the building’s thermal performance. The thermal conductivity of the examined infill structures is found to vary between 0.122 to 0.17 W/m.K, while if these structures are successful in replacing conventional building materials, the minimum annual saving in energy cost will be about $1/m2. Therefore, selecting an infill structure can be essential for reducing building energy consumption. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing; 3D-printed concrete walls; building efficiency; energy saving; sustainable building; thermal conductivity","","","","","","Umm Al-Qura University, UQU; Ministry of Education – Kingdom of Saudi Arabi, MOE","The authors acknowledge the support provided by Umm Al-Qura University (UQU) and the Ministry of Education.

Shell lattice is a kind of microstructure that consists of a continuous, smooth shell. It has been fabricated as an ultra-low-density material called Shellular, which provides excellent strength and stiffness and has significant multi-functional applications such as heat radiation, permeability, and diffusivity. Most shell lattices in the literature are based on triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS). However, TPMSs are derived from limited types of implicit functions and thus have limited material space. This work proposes the parametric shell lattice (PSL), a type of shell lattice described by a simple and efficient parametric model. The parametric model consists of a skeleton and a set of generation parameters, from which the shell structure can be derived. Various shell lattices with different topologies can be extracted from the parametric model by controlling the generation parameters. Then, a parametric shape optimization method is used to optimize the generation parameters to obtain the PSL with target mechanical properties. A group of PSLs with tailored mechanical properties, including isotropic elasticity, tailored Young's modulus, shear modulus, and Poisson's ratio, are designed. Physical experiments demonstrate that the designed PSLs could realize elastic isotropy and high stiffness compared with TPMS lattices. Thanks to the parametric representation, the geometric characteristics of PSL are preserved during the optimization procedure. In addition, the PSL also possesses high efficiency in storage and slicing for additive manufacturing. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Mechanical property; Parametric model; Shape optimization; Shell lattices","Additives; Elastic moduli; Microstructure; Shape optimization; Shells (structures); Stiffness; Topology; Complicated geometry; Low-density materials; Multi-functional; Parametric models; Shape-optimization; Shell lattice; Strength and stiffness; Traditional materials; Triply periodic minimal surfaces; Ultra low density; 3D printers","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (CJGJZD20200617102202007); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality","We thank all the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and constructive suggestions.

As the largest defect depends on the final volume of the component, which changes according to the topology, an iterative procedure is adopted to avoid volume constraints in the optimization problem. The procedure is applied to an actual aerospace bracket component and its strength and limitations are discussed in comparison with the TO formulations presented in the literature. Results show that considering the defect population significantly affects the final topology, while leading to a feasible optimum. Further, even though the computational time increases, an additional 15% of mass saving is achieved by adopting the proposed iterative procedure with respect to a volume constraint-based formulation of TopFat. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive Manufacturing; Defect Population; Fatigue; Topology Optimization","3D printers; Additives; Defects; Shape optimization; Topology; Additive manufacturing process; Aerospace components; Cracks propagation; Defect population; Defect size distribution; Fatigue design; First principal stress; Large defects; Topology optimisation; Volume constraint; Fatigue of materials","","","","","Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR","This work has been supported by the Research Project AMICO (code ARS01_00758) funded by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research.","Frazier W.E., Metal additive manufacturing: a review, J.

Here, a non-transferred arc (NTA)-based wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) system has been developed to achieve the above objectives, where the arc is only generated between tungsten electrode and consumable filler wire. No electrical contact with the substrate facilitate deposits even on the non-conductive substrate surface, which helps to remove the final deposits easily. The influence of deposition parameters (welding current, voltage, wire feed speed (WFS) and travel speed) on response characteristics (bead uniformity, height deviation, droplet diameter, and droplet transfer frequency) is studied on a multi-performance level using grey relational analysis (GRA). Then, single- and multi-bead layer is fabricated over SiO2 substrate for ease in part removal after complete fabrication. WFS is referred to as a key deposition parameter that influences all deposition characteristics. It has been observed that NTA-based WAAM results in high bead uniformity with minimal spatter and low bead height difference between start and exit arc point. Complete ferrite microstructure with few pearlites is observed on the deposits with similar elemental composition on the top, bottom and interface surfaces. X-ray diffraction (XRD) study reveals ferrite diffraction planes ({110}, {200}, {211} and {220}) with no intermetallic formations on deposits. Also, compressive residual stress with less variation in crystallite size, stress, strain and microhardness among the top, bottom and lateral deposit surfaces indicates the fabricated part’s isotropic nature. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Dislocation density;

The closed cell foams were made from the most commonly used thermoplastic, High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE). The hollow glass microspheres are infused in HDPE at varying volume %. The available data on these foams' mechanical properties are used by the chosen machine learning (ML) algorithms to propose the best suited algorithm for such a three-phased microstructure as these closed cell foams exhibit. Finally, the strength predictions from the models were validated using experimental data. The models were trained with nozzle temperature, bed temperature, and force values as input parameters. The output parameters predicted were the tensile and flexural strength. LightGBM outperforms all other models in terms of performance among ensemble-based models, while H2OAutoML outperforms all other models. All the ML algorithms produced models with greater than 95% accuracy. Finally, memory and time consumption for each model are presented. © 2022 The Authors","3D printing; Composite; GMB; HDPE; Mechanical response","Bending strength; Foams; High density polyethylenes; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Tensile strength; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Automated machines; Closed cell foams; GMB; High-density polyethylenes; Hollow glass microspheres; Machine learning algorithms; Machine learning approaches; Mechanical response; 3D printers","","","","","","","Doddamani M., Dynamic mechanical analysis of 3D printed eco-friendly lightweight composite, Compos.

It is sometimes required to exhibit locally different material behaviours from parts used for various purposes in the industry. In such requirements, the use of FGM structures emerges as a solution. The fabrication of FGM structures with traditional manufacturing methods is generally complicated and sometimes not possible. However, the additive manufacturing (AM) technique, which is the topic of many applications and research today, has emerged as a superior manufacturing method compared to traditional methods in fabrication FGM structures, thanks to its advantages. Fabrication in the form of layers with the AM allows the fabrication of layers with varying material properties. This study was carried out on the fabrication of FGM structures by the wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) method, which is one of the metal AM techniques. Low alloy steel (ER70S-6) and austenitic stainless steel (308LSi) metal wires are used in FGM structures. The FGM structure was successfully fabricated by the WAAM method. Hardness, tensile, and fatigue tests were applied to determine the mechanical properties of the part. In addition, XRD analysis and microstructure studies were carried out to understand the metallurgical properties. As a result of the mechanical tests, no defects were observed in the FGM interfaces, and an increase of up to 46% was observed in the tensile strength compared to the single-material fabrication. In hardness measurements and microstructure studies, it has been observed that the FGM structure exhibits different properties according to the changing layers. It has been concluded that the fatigue limit of the FGM part in the horizontal direction is 25% higher than in the vertical direction. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Bimetal; Fatigue; FGM; Functionally graded material; Steel; Tensile test; WAAM","3D printers; Additives; Beams and girders; Fabrication; Fatigue testing; Friction; Hardness; Industrial research; Microstructure; Structural properties; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Wire; Dissimilar steel; Fabrication and characterizations; Functionally graded materials structures; Manufacturing methods; Manufacturing techniques; Material behaviour; Single structure; Tensile test; Wire arc; Wire arc additive manufacturing; Functionally graded materials","","","","","Karabük University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit, (FDK-2019–2130); Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu, TÜBİTAK, (219M111); Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu, TÜBİTAK","This study was supported by Karabük University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit (Project number: FDK-2019–2130 ) and The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (Project number: 219M111 ).

The examined samples are printed in flat orientation with 0°, 45° and 90° raster angles. During the experiments the deformation of the specimens is continuously scanned with the 3D Aramis measuring system utilizing the digital imaging correlation technique, enabling the determination of strain and stress distribution. In the modelling, it is assumed that each printed layer is a homogeneous transversely isotropic medium with the raster direction treated as the favoured one. The finite element models are developed in the Abaqus-Standard package. A two-dimensional equivalent single-layer approach is utilized to describe the deformation and stress state of the samples. The failure progress of the material is simulated by making use of the Hashin damage algorithm with energy-based softening, whereas the non-linear in-plane shear behaviour is included. © 2022 The Authors","3D printed composites; Aramis; Hashin damage; PLA; Polylactic acid","3D printers; ABAQUS; Failure (mechanical); Finite element method; Polyesters; Rasterization; 3d printed composite; Arami; Experimental and numerical studies; Failure behaviors; Fem analyze; Hashin damage; Polylactic acid; Tensile failures; Tensile loads; Deformation","","","","","","","Abrate S., Di Sciuva M., Equivalent single layer theories for composite and sandwich structures: a review, Compos.

Overlap, scanning radius and laser beam defocusing were varied while all the other process parameters were kept constant. So, the role of process parameters was analysed in terms of microstructure, defectiveness and response to heat treatment. Specifically, the as built samples were subjected to stress relaxation heat treatment (650 °C-2 h) and H 900 heat treatment (solution treatment at 1100 °C 1 h + 480 °C-1 h). On the as built, stress relieved and H 900 heat treated samples the corrosion resistance, microstructural evolution and hardness were studied. Moreover, Ultrasonic Peening treatment (UPT) was applied and its effect corrosion resistance was evaluated. The study was carried out by optical, scanning and transmission electron microscopes, Vickers hardness, DRX and Image analysis software. It was found that the amount of austenitic phase increases with the decreasing of the scanning radius from 5000 µm to 1250 µm; with positive defocusing of laser beam (+1mm) respect to in focus processed sample and with increasing of the overlap from 25 µm to 50 µm. Each samples exhibit pores lower than 0,3% in terms of area percentage and mostly circular in morphology. In the process variability window, no significant difference in defects occurrence were observed. In the as built state, different values of hardness were found according to the different microstructure and average grain size. After the stress relaxation heat treatments at 650 °C-2 h all the samples exhibit similar hardness values while the most austenitic and finer grained as built samples exhibit higher increasing in hardness after H900 heat treatment. Corrosion resistance changes as function of the different process parameter and heat treatment and is improved by Ultrasonic Peening mechanical treatment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Corrosion resistance; Hardness; Microstructure evolution; Selective Laser Melting; Stainless steel; Thermo-mechanical treatment; Ultrasonic peening","Age hardening; Austenite; Defects; Heat resistance; Light transmission; Melting; Microstructure; Scanning; Selective laser melting; Steel corrosion; Thermomechanical treatment; Vickers hardness; Additive manufacturing process; Manufacturing process parameters; Microstructure evolutions; Precipitation-hardening stainless steel; Process parameters; Selective laser melting; Steel samples; Thermo-mechanical treatments; Treatment effects; Ultrasonic peening; Corrosion resistance","","","","","","","Smith W.F., Structure and Properties of Engineering Alloys, (1992); Hsiao C.N., Chiou C.S., Yang J.R., Aging reactionsin a17–4 PH stainlesssteel, Mater.

Indeed, welding, casting and additive manufacturing of steels lead to temperatures sufficiently high to start the evaporation of some low boiling point element such as manganese. In this paper, both experimental and numerical approaches are developed to study and quantify this phenomenon. Experimentally, an ex-situ aerodynamic levitation apparatus is employed to apply varying temperatures or durations at liquid state to a 304L steel sample. These experiments are represented numerically with a multiphysics model solving heat transfer, fluid flow and evolution of concentration of manganese dynamically. Equations chosen to represent this poorly studied phenomena are presented and compared to experiments. A comparison highlights a good accuracy of the proposed model. This precision increases particularly when the melting duration is high.

The effects of heat treatment parameters on the microstructure-phase changes of the material were investigated by optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Electron Dispersion Spectroscopy (EDX), and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) techniques. Likewise, microhardness and dry sliding wear tests were performed to determine the relationship of heat treatment parameters (especially intercritical heat treatment) to the mechanical properties and wear of the material. The results reveal that the intercritical heat treatment is exciting for the AM/MS1 material. © IMechE 2022.","additive manufacturing; Direct metal laser sintering (SLM); intercritical heat treatment;

Production with these technologies does, however, introduce a large amount of variation and additional unknowns. These random variations from idealized geometry or material properties can harm the performance of the design. The current work presents an approach to improve the fatigue life of such structures, and simultaneously reduce its influence from random variations in local thickness. Following an initial numerical study, the results are experimentally validated. Experimental results show a significant improvement in fatigue life in the redesigned sample with a tailored thickness distribution. © 2022, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; Fatigue improvement; Random field; Robust design; Thickness tailoring","","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (390881007)","Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

Thus, several 3D objects having complex shapes were printed by the polycondensation of 3-acryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) and chiral silane monomers that were obtained by reacting (1R,2R)-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine or (1S,2S)-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine with (3-Isocyanatopropyl)triethoxysilane. The dual-function monomer APTMS enabled both localized photopolymerization and polycondensation. Printed gyroids, cubes, and disk-shaped chiral monoliths successfully revealed the enantioselective adsorption of tryptophan enantiomers. It was found that the macroscopic shape of the monolith affects the adsorption performance and its enantioselectivity. High enantioselectivity was obtained when the objects were formed from a chiral silane synthesized from (1R,2R)-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine: L-tryptophan was adsorbed ∼10 fold higher than D-tryptophan. When the chiral object was fabricated using a chiral silane monomer prepared from (1S,2S)-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine, the enantioselectivity of the adsorption was reversed towards the D-tryptophan isomer. The new approach utilizes the 3D printing methodologies developed here for all-printed enantioselective separation columns; the printed macroporosity facilitates efficient flow, and the meso/microporous walls facilitate enantioselectivity. © 2022","3D printing; Chiral organosilica; Selective enantiomer adsorption; Sol-gel; Stereolithography","3D printers; Adsorption; Amino acids; Enantioselectivity; Monomers; Photopolymerization; Polycondensation; Silica; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Chiral organosilicum; Chiral silanes; D-tryptophan; Organosilicas; Polycondensations; Porous monoliths; Selective enantiomer adsorption; Sol'gel; Enantiomers","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Israel, (314414)","This research was supported by the Israel Ministry of Science and Technology , grant number 314414 .

In the context of the present COVID-19 pandemic, the concept is illustrated by a three-dimensional (3D)-printable turbine-driven blower-type medical ventilator, which solely relies on availability of high-pressure oxygen supply and a conventional plastic-printer. Forming a fully pre-assembled turbomachine in its final form, the architecture consists of two concentric parts, a static casing with an embedded hydrostatic bearing surrounding a rotating monolithic shell structure that includes a radial turbine mechanically driving a centrifugal blower, which in turn supplies the oxygen enriched air to the lungs of the patient. Although the component level turbomachinery design of the described architecture relies on well-established guidelines and computational fluid dynamics methods, this approach has the capability to shift the focus of additive manufacturing methods to design for pre-assembled turbomachinery systems. Upon finalizing the topology, the geometry is manufactured from polyethylene terephthalate (PETG) plastic using a simple tabletop extrusion-based machine and its performance is evaluated in a test facility. The findings of the experimental campaign are reported in terms of flow and loading coefficients and are compared with simulation results. A good agreement is observed between the two data sets, thereby fully corroborating the applied design approach and the viability of additively manufactured pre-assembled turbomachines. Eliminating long and costly processes due to presence of numerous parts, different manufacturing methods, logistics of various subcontractors, and complex assembly procedures, the proposed concept has the potential to reduce the cost of a turbomachine to capital equipment depreciation and raw material.

In contrast, meshfree methods such as the reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM) possess unique features conducive to modelling extreme events such as the absence of a structured mesh and the ease of adaptive refinement, among others. While the semi-Lagrangian reproducing kernel (SL-RK) shape functions of RKPM defined in the current configuration have proven to be effective in extreme event modelling, the computational cost for the re-evaluation of the shape functions at every time step is costly. In this work, a deformation-dependent coupling of the Lagrangian reproducing kernel (L-RK) and SL-RK approximations is proposed for the solution of a hydro-mechanical formulation for effective simulations of landslides. The ramp function is constructed based on an equivalent plastic strain as a deformation-dependent transition from L-RK shape functions to SL-RK ones as the deformation progresses. The particular focus of the paper will be on modelling seepage-induced landslides with a mixed u–p formulation to couple the solid and fluid phases. Examples are presented to examine the effectiveness of this coupled Lagrangian/semi-Lagrangian reproducing kernel (L–SL RK) formulation and to highlight its performance in landslide modelling. © 2022, The Author(s).","Lagrangian semi-Lagrangian coupling; Landslide; Meshfree modeling; Reproducing kernel particle method","","","","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA, (DE-NA0003525); Sandia National Laboratories, SNL, (1655264)","Funding text 1: Sandia National Laboratories to UC San Diego under Contract Agreement 1655264. ; Funding text 2: The support of this work by the Sandia National Laboratories to UC San Diego under Contract Agreement 1655264 is greatly acknowledged.

Automated fiber placement of the continuous carbon fibers in a polyether ether ketone matrix was performed to consolidate the carbon fibers into a printed preform. Pyrolysis was performed to convert the polymer matrix to porous carbon, and then Si was introduced by reactive melt infiltration to convert a portion of the carbon matrix to silicon carbide. The densities and microstructures were characterized after each step during the processing, and the mechanical properties were measured. The C/C-SiC composites exhibited a porosity of 10–20%, characteristic flexural strength of 234.91 MPa, and Weibull modulus of 3.21. The composites displayed toughness via a significant displacement to failure. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing; ceramic matrix composites; reactive melt infiltration","","","","","","DOE Public Access Plan; United States Government; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL; UT-Battelle, (DE-AC05-00OR22725)","Funding text 1: This manuscript has been authored by UT-Battelle LLC under Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy.

The process control of additive manufacturing, especially the mechanical properties of the printed parts is so difficult because of a large number of parameters that influence these properties. As such, the combination of these parameters makes the process expensive. That is why previous investigations that deal with the same subject are limited in their study to some parameters. The objective of this study is to take advantage of the performance of artificial intelligence tools and build artificial models that can take advantage of some experimental results in order to predict the desired property (flexural strength). © 2022, International Organization on 'Technical and Physical Problems of Engineering'.

Strain hardening behaviour has been analysed and discussed using the combination of characterisation techniques. The LMD-ed FeCoCrNiAl0.5 had a true yield strength and strain of ∼463 MPa and 2.94%. Also, the true tensile strength of the LMD-ed FeCoCrNiAl0.5 reached 876 MPa, together with the ductility of 24.97% (engineering strain). The LMD-ed FeCoCrNiAl0.5 HEA exhibited a dual-phase structure of 93% face-centred cubic (FCC) phase and 6.9% ordered B2 phase. The phase boundary between the disordered FCC and ordered B2 phases played a key role in the barrier, which can block the movement of dislocations because of the lattice distortion, very large angle, and mismatch of the lattice. Dislocation pile-up and tangle caused the dislocation density near the phase boundaries to be higher than that in other areas, meanwhile, they further prevented the movement of dislocation under stress as they generated back stress, therefore LMD-ed FeCoCrNiAl0.5 HEA had a good strain hardening behaviour with a strain hardening exponent of 0.92. This study provided an innovative insight into the development of HEAs with ordered phase by laser additive manufacturing for structural applications. © 2022","FeCoCrNiAl<sub>0.5</sub>; High-entropy alloy; Laser melting deposition; Phase boundary; Strain hardening","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Cobalt alloys; Deposition; Entropy; High-entropy alloys; Iron alloys; Lattice mismatch; Melting; Microstructure; Piles; Selective laser melting; Tensile strength; B2 phase; Fecocrnial0.5; Hardening mechanism; High entropy alloys; Laser melting deposition; Low-costs; Manufacturing methods; Strain hardening behavior; Strengthening mechanisms; Structural applications; Strain hardening","","","","","Advanced Materials Processing and Manufacturing Research Institute; Enterprise Science and Technology Commissioner Project, (22YDTPJC00310); School of Materials Science and Engineering; Tianjin Sino-German University of Applied Sciences; Tianjin University of Technology, TJUT; Cranfield University; University of Wollongong, UOW; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52205409)","Funding text 1: The lead author L.S.

Previously, no research reported MWFL based on SOA and EDFA combination utilizing SLM interferometer. The combination of a polarizer and SOA induces intensity-dependent loss mechanism at a certain polarization state. It is utilized to flatten and stabilize the multiwavelength spectrum. The laser produces maximum lasing lines of 65 channels within 5 dB uniformity and with 10 dB of extinction ratio. The removal of EDFA from the cavity reduces the peak power by 11 dB with the output spectrum shifted to shorter wavelength by 6 nm. Furthermore, the laser shows a significantly stable output with peak power fluctuation lower than 0.8 dB within 100 min of observation time. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Erbium-doped fiber amplifier; Intensity-dependent loss; Multiwavelength fiber laser; Sagnac loop mirror interferometer; Semiconductor optical amplifier","Fiber lasers; Fibers; Interferometers; Laser mirrors; Optical switches; Semiconductor optical amplifiers; A: semiconductors; Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers; Hybrid optical amplifiers; Intensity-dependent; Intensity-dependent loss; Laser-based; Multi wavelength fiber laser; Peak power; Sagnac loop mirror; Sagnac loop mirror interferometer; Erbium doped fiber amplifiers","","","","","","","Sanchez-gonzalez A., Perez-herrera R.A., Roldan-varona P., Duran-escudero M., Rodriguez-cobo L., Lopez-higuera J.M., Lopez-amo M., A dual-wavelength fiber laser sensor with temperature and strain discrimination, Sensors, 22, 6888, pp. 1-10, (2022); Pizzaia J.P.L., Silva R.L., Leal-Junior A.G., Castellani C.E.S., Temperature sensor based on an erbium-doped fiber Sagnac interferometer, Appl.

Such devices must be flexible to follow the contours of human anatomy. With numerous potential applications, a wide variety of flexible wearable devices have been created, taking various forms and functions. Therefore, different fabrication techniques and materials are employed, resulting in fragmentation of the list of equipment and materials needed to make different devices. This study attempted to simplify and streamline the fabrication process of all key components, including microfluidic chip and flexible electrode units. A combination of diode laser CNC machine and polyimide tape is used to fabricate flexible microfluidic chip and laser-induced graphene (LIG) electrodes, to create flexible microfluidic sensing devices. Laser ablation on polyimide tape can directly create microfluidic features on either PDMS substrates or LIG electrodes. The two components can be assembled to form a flexible microfluidic sensing device that can perform basic electrochemical analysis and conform to curved surfaces while undergoing microfluidic flow. This study has shown that simple, commonly available equipment and materials can be used to fabricate flexible microfluidic sensing devices quickly and easily, which is highly suitable for rapid prototyping of wearable devices. © 2022 by the authors.","CNC; diode laser; electrochemical analysis; electrode; flexible; laser-induced graphene; microfluidic; PDMS; polyimide; wearable device","Diodes; Electrochemical electrodes; Fabrication; Fluidic devices; Graphene; Laser ablation; Microchannels; Semiconductor lasers; Wearable technology; CNC; Diode-laser; Electrochemical analysis; Flexible; Flexible microfluidics; Laser induced; Laser-induced graphene; PDMS; Sensing devices; Wearable devices; Microfluidics","","","","","Thailand Science Research and Innovation for Fundamental Fund, (4368083); Vidyasirimedhi Institute of Science and Technology, VISTEC","The authors thank VISTEC for general study funding and a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship to T.T., the Thailand Science Research and Innovation for Fundamental Fund Grant No. 4368083 and David Apps, Edinburgh Medical School, Edinburgh, Scotland for manuscript proofreading.

Because of the particles’ high chemical stability, and high hardness. In this study, WC-Co particles were chosen as reinforcements to produce GCr15 bearing steel matrix composites by SLM. The microstructures and friction performance of the composites were observed and analyzed. The effect of the laser line energy density (LED) on phases, microstructure and friction performance features is investigated systematically. The phase of samples added with WC-Co particles changed obviously, from mainly α-Fe to γ-Fe. At the same time, Fe7C3, WC, CrSi2, M3W3C phases were found in the composites. The composite prepared by SLM has a good inter-reaction interface between the GCr15 bearing steel matrix and WC-Co particles. Two special microstructures, nail-shaped and cellular microstructure were found in the composites, and with the increase of LED, the size of the cellular microstructure increased, maximum average size is 1.45 μm. After adding WC-Co particles, the properties of GCr15 bearing steel were significantly enhanced, and the microhardness increased from 651 ± 61 HV0.2 to 1093 ± 139 HV0.2, and the COF and wear rate decreased from 0.5091 and 1.82 ± 0.17 × 10−6 mm3N−1 m−1 to 0.4116 and 0.58 ± 0.11 × 10−6 mm3N−1 m−1, respectively © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Friction performance; GCr15 bearing steel; Microstructure; Selective laser melting","Chemical stability; Chromium alloys; Chromium steel; Friction; Melting; Reinforcement; Selective laser melting; Wear of materials; Wear resistance; Cellular microstructure; Co particles; Energy density; Friction performance; GCr15 bearing steel; High wear resistance; Microstructure performance; Particulates; Selective laser melting; Steel composites; Microstructure","","","","","Xi'an Science and Technology Plan Project, (2020KJRC0048); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51671152, 51874225, 52104341); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Xi’an Jiaotong University, XJTU; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFB3701802); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; Key Science and Technology Program of Shaanxi Province, (2020ZDLGY13 -10); Key Science and Technology Program of Shaanxi Province","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2021YFB3701802 ); National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51671152 , 51874225 ， 52104341 ); Shaanxi Provincial Science and Technology Project (No. 2020ZDLGY13 -10); Xi'an Science and Technology Plan Project (No. 2020KJRC0048 ).

In this study, we first discovered that vivianite can effectively photoactivate peroxodisulfate (PDS) to produce some reactive oxygen species (ROS) for tetracycline antibiotics (TCs) degradation. The results demonstrated that vivianite could efficiently activate PDS to achieve 100% removal of TCs under LED UV light (UVL), visible light (VL) or real solar light (SL) irradiation within 10 min, respectively. More importantly, ca. 80%, 78% and 40%∼58% of TOC removal efficiencies were achieved under UVL, VL and SL irradiation within 30 min, respectively. As well, toxicological simulation and antibacterial studies showed that the aquatic toxicity of the TCs intermediates was lower than those of the original TCs. This work provided new insights into the application of photoactivated sulfate radical-advanced oxidation process (SR-AOP) for organic pollutants degradation over vivianite, which may encourage the recovery and utilization of vivianite in the wastewater treatment process. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Degradation; Peroxydisulfate; Photoactivation; Tetracycline antibiotics; Vivianite","Antibiotics; Light; Mineralogy; Organic pollutants; Phosphate minerals; Phosphorus; Recovery; Solar light; Sulfur compounds; Wastewater treatment; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Peroxodisulfate; Peroxydisulfate; Phosphorus recovery; Photo activations; Photo-activated; Sulfate radicals; Tetracycline antibiotics; Vivianite; Waste water treatment plants; Irradiation","","","","","BUCEA Doctor Graduate Scientific Research Ability Improvement Project, (DG2021004); Fundamental Research Funds for Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture, (X20147/X20141/X20135/X20146); Science and Technology General Project of Beijing Municipal Education Commission, (KM202110016010); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (22176012, 51878023); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (8202016); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFC0402505); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; Beijing Talents Fund, (2020A27); Beijing Talents Fund","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (22176012, 51878023), Beijing Natural Science Foundation (8202016), National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0402505), Beijing Talent Project (2020A27), Science and Technology General Project of Beijing Municipal Education Commission (KM202110016010), The Fundamental Research Funds for Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture (X20147/X20141/X20135/X20146) and BUCEA Doctor Graduate Scientific Research Ability Improvement Project (DG2021004).

The results showed that the width of the AAJ processing area increased with the increase of air pressure but decreased with the increase of the injection angle. The surface quality of SLM samples could be improved effectively by AAJ processing. The optimized percentage of surface roughness value (Sa) was the largest, reaching 54 % when the injection angle was 60ᵒ and the air pressure was 0.5 MPa; The surface hardness of the sample increased the maximum percentage, reaching 22 % when the injection angle was 75ᵒ, and the air pressure was 0.5 MPa. The initial abrasive grains mainly had three shapes: flake, block, and column. The flaky abrasive grains had sharp edges, a good effect on matrix removal, large processing area but shallow depth of action; The block abrasive particles were mainly removed by extrusion and accompanied by severe friction with the substrate, and layered chips were generated; The columnar abrasive grains mainly scratched the surface of the substrate to generate scratches. The material's erosion rate (ER) was the largest, reaching 1.3 %, and the processing efficiency was the highest when the injection angle was 60ᵒ and the air pressure was 0.4 MPa. The α′ martensite near the sample's surface was elongated by AAJ processing, and the direction was parallel to the sample's surface. The depth of processing influence was the largest, reaching about 30 µm when the injection angle was 75ᵒ and the air pressure was 0.5 MPa. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Abrasive air jet; Microstructure; Selective laser melting; Surface quality; TC4","Aluminum alloys; Atmospheric pressure; Jets; Melting; Selective laser melting; Surface roughness; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Abrasive air jet; Abrasive air-jet machining; Abrasive grains; Air jet; Air-pressure; Injection angles; Micro abrasive air jets; Sample surface; Selective laser melting; TC4; Surface properties","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by grants 51975006 and 51505006 from the National Natural Science Foundation of China .

Regression learners were applied with different configurations to predict the length of the defects. These algorithms were trained using large datasets generated with Finite Element Method simulations. The different predictive methods obtained were optimized using Bayesian inference. Using predictive methods generated and based on intrinsic performance results, knowing the material characteristics, the defect length can be predicted from single temperature data in defect and non-defect zone. Thus, the developed algorithms were implemented in a laboratory set-up carried out on ad-hoc manufactured parts of Nylon and polylactic acid which include induced defects with different sizes and thicknesses. Using the trained algorithm, the deviation of the predicted results for the defect size varied between 13% and 37% for PLA and between 13% and 36% for Nylon. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; Machine learning; Non-Destructive Testing (NDT); Quality control; Thermography","Additives; Bayesian networks; Defects; Inference engines; Large dataset; Machine learning; Nondestructive examination; Polyamides; Rayon; Thermography (imaging); Defect size; Internal defects; Machine simulation; Machine-learning; Non destructive testing; Non-destructive testing; Predictive methods; Size measurements; Temperature data; Thermography; 3D printers","","","","","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (RTI2018-099850-B-I00)","This research has been funded by Ministry of Science and Innovation (Government of Spain) through the research project titled Fusion of non-destructive technologies and numerical simulation methods for the inspection and monitoring of joints in new materials and additive manufacturing processes (FaTIMA) with code RTI2018-099850-B-I00.

However, fog providers may be under heavy loads from the IoT networks, leading to Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations. This article considers an architecture consisting of multiple fog computing providers and provides a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) model for predicting the availability of each fog computing provider regarding factors such as the number of incoming requests to each fog, deadline-missed workflows, and the offloaded tasks from the fogs to the cloud computing. This HMM model is trained using the unsupervised Baum-Welch algorithm, and the availability probability of each fog is computed using the Viterbi algorithm. Then, the fog provider availability probability is used to select a fog computing provider and schedule IoT workflows on it. Additionally, we have improved Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm and presented a Discrete Opposition-based of this algorithm, denoted as DO-HHO, for scientific workflow scheduling. The results of extensive experiments conducted using iFogSim demonstrate that our proposed scheme can significantly reduce offloaded tasks on cloud computing, deadline-missed workflows, and SLA violations, outperforming state-of-the-art works. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Energy Efficiency; Fog Computing; Hidden Markov Model; Optimization; Workflow Scheduling","Fog; Fog computing; Hidden Markov models; Internet of things; Optimization; Quality of service; Scheduling; Viterbi algorithm; Cloud-computing; Cost of service; Energy; Hidden-Markov models; Optimisations; Optimization algorithms; Quality-of-service; Servicelevel agreement (SLA); Work-flows; Workflow scheduling; Energy efficiency","","","","","Chosun University, CU, (K949856044–1); Chosun University, CU","This research was supported by research fund from Chosun University , K949856044–1 .","Masdari M., Naghiloo F., Fuzzy logic-based sink selection and load balancing in multi-sink wireless sensor networks, Wirel.

Aluminum (Al 6061) was pretreated by tempering and annealing prior to bonding through UAM. Following UAM, multiscale material characterization was performed. Tensile testing in the rolling (x) direction demonstrated the material became harder after the UAM process, and nanoindentation demonstrated the foil-foil interfaces became harder than the bulk foil material. The strengthening effects are a result of microstructure changes at the interfaces and in the bulk foil regions which were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy. These microstructure changes result from dynamic recrystallization, dynamic recovery, adiabatic heating, and precipitate dissolution. This study signifies the metallurgical features creating mechanical strength increases, rather than decreases, in UAM builds. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Aluminum alloys; Lattice defect formation; Mechanical properties; Microstructure evolution; Ultrasonic additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Dynamic recrystallization; Dynamics; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Microstructure; Scanning electron microscopy; Strain rate; Tensile testing; Aluminum (Al); Defects formation; Deformation process; High-strain-rate; Lattice defect formation; Manufacturing IS; Microstructure changes; Microstructure evolutions; Strengthening effect; Ultrasonic additive manufacturing; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Air Force National Laboratory, (FA864920P0998); Center for Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing; Institute for Advanced Materials and Manufacturing; KLA-Tencor; National Science Foundation Industry-University Cooperative Research Center; Oak Ridge National Laboratory Manufacturing Demonstration; National Science Foundation, NSF, (IIP 1738723); National Science Foundation, NSF; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE; Basic Energy Sciences, BES, (DE-AC02-06CH11357); Basic Energy Sciences, BES; Ohio State University, OSU; University of Tennessee, UT; University of Tennessee, Knoxville, UTK; Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, UAM","Funding text 1: Preconditioning of the aluminum was performed at the Center for Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing located at The Ohio State University (OSU).

Most additive technologies are associated with the manufacture of the product by melting and fusion of metal powder particles by means of laser radiation. Eutectic aluminum alloys of the Al–Ca, Al–Ce, Al–La, and Al–Ni systems, which have excellent casting properties, are supposedly promising for use in additive technologies. However, there is very little information in the literature on the effect of laser processing on such eutectic structures. In this regard, the work investigated the effect of laser radiation on the structure and mechanical properties of samples from eutectic compositions, namely, Al–8% Ca, Al–10% La, Al–10% Ce, and Al–6% Ni. To do this, the continuous laser modification of their surfaces was carried out. The level of hardening was evaluated by measuring the microhardness of the modified surface. The mechanisms of fracture of specimens under tensile testing have been established. It is shown that, in the structure of the modified surfaces of samples of four alloys, the distribution of the second component becomes more uniform compared to the structure of the base metal. In the Al–8% Ca alloy, the greatest hardening effect is observed, which, however, contributes to embrittlement under tensile stress. However, the modified Al–8% Ca alloy is of interest because of its increased hardness and therefore possibly increased wear resistance. On the contrary, laser modification of the surfaces of the Al–10% Ce, Al–10% La, and Al–6% Ni alloy samples provides a lower hardening effect, but increases their tensile strength with the formation of a ductile or mixed ductile and brittle fracture. The results obtained confirm the prospects of using alloys of the Al–Ca, Al–Ce, Al–La, and Al–Ni systems in additive manufacturing. © 2022, Allerton Press, Inc.","Al–Ca system; Al–Ce system; Al–La system; Al–Ni system; eutectic aluminum alloys; laser surface modification; mechanical properties; structure","3D printers; Additives; Brittle fracture; Ductile fracture; Eutectics; Hardening; Nickel alloys; Powder metals; Structure (composition); Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Wear resistance; Additive technology; Al–ca system; Al–ce system; Al–la system; Al–ni system; CE systems; Eutectic aluminum alloy; Laser modifications; Laser surface modification; Modified surfaces; additive; alloy; manufacturing; mechanical property; tensile stress; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka, (075-15-2021-696); Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka; Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (20-19-00746); Russian Science Foundation, RSF","This work was supported by the Russian Science Foundation (grant no. 20-19-00746).

This is associated with the micro-scale cellular structure and complex grain and sub-grain structure, resulting from high cooling rates occurring during the additive manufacturing process. The consequences of these peculiar microstructural features on plastic localization early in the plastic regime at the sub-grain scale are investigated. The plastic localization involved during monotonic deformation of conventional and additive manufactured 316L stainless steels is investigated using high-resolution digital image correlation. Significant heterogeneous slip localization is observed in the additively manufactured 316L stainless steels compared to the wrought 316L stainless steels. The cellular structure and low-angle grain boundaries are observed to control the incipient plasticity. In addition, slip localization characteristics indicate that the additional strengthening in the AM material is mainly related to the cellular structure acting as a dislocation forest-type obstacle.  © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.","Additively manufactured 316L stainless steel; High-resolution digital image correlation; Plastic localization; Scanning electron microscopy digital image correlation; Slip localization","Additives; Austenitic stainless steel; Cellular automata; Grain boundaries; Scanning electron microscopy; Strain measurement; 316 L stainless steel; Additively manufactured 316l stainless steel; Digital image correlations; High resolution digital images; High-resolution digital image correlation; Localisation; Plastic localization; Scanning electron microscopy digital image correlation; Slip localization; Image correlation","","","","","Department of Defense Vannevar Bush Fellowship, (N00014-18-1-3031); Energy Biosciences Institute, EBI; Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, Harvard University, MRSEC, (DMR 1720256); Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, Harvard University, MRSEC","J.C.S is grateful for financial support from the Energy & Biosciences Institute (EBI), USA through the EBI-Shell Program.

The SED-SL specifies an analytic stress length function (which defines the eddy viscosity) describing a physically sound two-dimensional multi-regime structure of transitional boundary layer. Previous studies showed accurate predictions, especially on the drag coefficient, by the SED-SL for airfoil flows at different subsonic Mach numbers, Reynolds numbers and angles of attack. Here, the SED-SL is extended to compute the hypersonic heat transfer on a 7 ∘ half-angle straight cone at Mach numbers 6 and 7 and angles of attack from 0 ∘ to 6 ∘. It is shown that a proper setting of the multi-regime structure with three parameters (i.e. a transition center, an after-transition near-wall eddy length, and a transition width quantifying transition overshoot) yields an accurate description of the surface heat fluxes measured in wind tunnels. Uniformly good agreements between simulations and measurements are obtained from windward to leeward side of the cone, implying the validity of the multi-regime description of the transition independent of instability mechanisms. It is concluded that a unified description for the HBL transition of cone is found, and might offer a basis for developing a new transition model that is simultaneously of computational simplicity, sound physics and greater accuracy. © 2022, The Author(s).","Cone; Heat flux; Hypersonic boundary layer transition; Transition model","Angle of attack; Heat transfer; Hypersonic boundary layers; Hypersonic flow; Mach number; Reynolds number; Wind tunnels; Accurate prediction; Airfoil flows; Angle-of-attack; Boundary layer transitions; Eddy viscosity; Hypersonic boundary layer transition; Length functions; Transition model; Transitional boundary layers; Two-dimensional; Heat flux","","","","","NNW; Open Project of Science and Technology on Scramjet Laboratory; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (91952201,11372008,11452002); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This material is based upon work supported by the NNW Project, the Open Project of Science and Technology on Scramjet Laboratory, and the NNSF of China under Grant Number 91952201,11372008,11452002.

In this paper, the proposed strategy was directed toward the use of bovine-bone-derived hydroxyapatite (HA) for surface properties enhancement and mechanical features reinforcement of the poly(lactic acid) matrix for composite filaments extrusion. The involvement of completely naturally derived materials in the technological process was based on factors such as sustainability, low cost, and a facile and green synthesis route. After the HA isolation and extraction from bovine bones by thermal processing, milling, and sorting, two dependent parameters—the HA particles size (<40 μm, <100 μm, and >125 μm) and ratio (0–50% with increments of 10%)—were simultaneously modulated for the first time during the incorporation into the polymeric matrix. The resulting melt mixtures were divided for cast pellets and extruded filaments development. Based on the obtained samples, the study was further designed to examine several key features by complementary surface–volume characterization techniques. Hence, the scanning electron microscopy and micro-CT results for all specimens revealed a uniform and homogenous dispersion of HA particles and an adequate adhesion at the ceramic/polymer interface, without outline pores, sustained by the shape and surface features of the synthesized ceramic particles. Moreover, an enhanced wettability (contact angle in the ~70−21° range) and gradual mechanical takeover were indicated once the HA ratio increased, independent of the particles size, which confirmed the benefits and feasibility of evenly blending the natural ceramic/polymeric components. The results correlation led to the selection of optimal technological parameters for the synthesis of adequate composite filaments destined for future additive manufacturing and biomedical applications. © 2022 by the authors.","ceramic-reinforced filaments; particle size; printable filaments; ratio influence","biomaterial; ceramic particle; hydroxyapatite; polymer; unclassified drug; Article; biomechanics; biomedical engineering; compressive strength; contact angle; crystallization; differential scanning calorimetry; micro-computed tomography; particle size; physical chemistry; scanning electron microscopy; surface property; wettability","","hydroxyapatite, 1306-06-5, 51198-94-8","ImageJ, National Institute of Health, United States; XL 30 ESEM TMP, Phillips, United States","National Institute of Health, United States; Phillips, United States","Corporation for National and Community Service, CNCS; Autoritatea Natională pentru Cercetare Stiintifică; Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii, UEFISCDI, (583PED/2022, PN-III-P2-2.1-PED-2021-1650)","This work was supported by a grant of the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS—UEFISCDI, project number PN-III-P2-2.1-PED-2021-1650, contract number 583PED/2022, project acronym BoneGapFill.","Manoj A., Bhuyan M., Banik S.R., Sankar M.R., Review on particle emissions during fused deposition modeling of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and polylactic acid polymers, Mater.

The mathematical model of the geometric features of the deposited layers and the deposition parameters was established using the quadratic general rotary unitized design. The layer width and height can be precisely predicted when the deposition parameters are given. The liquid metal flow behaviors in the molten pool were studied by simulation calculation, and the effects of the deposition parameters on the layer width and height were revealed by the analysis of the temperature and flow field distribution. In the multi-pass multi-layer deposition process, owing to the height difference, the more remelted liquid metal of the original deposited metal flows to the side of the layer being deposited under gravity’s action, resulting in the separation of the passes. Overlapping with variable distances was proposed to eliminate the separation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Al–Zn–Mg–Cu alloy; Variable polarity TIG; Wire arc additive manufacturing","Additives; Copper alloys; Deposition; Liquid metals; Magnesium alloys; Wire; Zinc alloys; Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy; Deposition Parameters; Layer width; Molten pool; Multi-layers; Multi-pass; Variable polarity; Variable polarity TIG; Wire arc; Wire arc additive manufacturing; 3D printers","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52275324, U21B2080); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Heilongjiang Provincial Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (LBH-Z18067); Heilongjiang Provincial Postdoctoral Science Foundation; National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents, (BX20180084); National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (FRFCU5710051321); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant Number: 52275324]; the Joint Funds of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant Number: U21B2080]; the National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents [grant number.

Antica di Collegno, 253, Turin, 10146, Italy","In this new era of space exploration, reusability and lower environmental impact are critical drivers in pursuing innovative solutions for access to space. One of these leading solutions is the Space Rider, a European reusable space plane with the ability to be both an “access to space” and a “return from space”. Following the lesson learned from the Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle (IXV) design and testing, the Space Rider will be equipped with a parafoil to enhance manoeuvrability during landing. Politecnico di Torino (PoliTO), in collaboration with Thales Alenia Space Italy (TAS-I), has developed an integrated tool to assess the landing performances of spaceplanes equipped with parafoils during conceptual design. The presented approach fuses sizing, dynamic models, guidance and control algorithms to provide a software suite for the rapid prototyping, sizing and performance assessment of spaceplanes’ parafoils.

Nanomaterials are an important component of conductive ink composition. LASIS (Laser Ablation Synthesis in Solution) is a physical method for creating nanoparticles in a liquid environment. This top-down technique employs well-known laser-based technologies to generate additive-free nanocolloids that are less harmful and more ecologically friendly. This study discusses recent advancements in the manufacturing of LASiS nanomaterials and their printed electronic applications. The parameters that determine the yield and attributes of LASiS nanoparticles are examined, with emphasis on specific use of such nanoparticles as conductive inks in the field of printed electronics.

However, the sizes of samples are several scales larger than those in the biomedical applications, which provides insufficient values for the industry use. To investigate the feasibility of SLM fabrication of thinner nitinol medical devices, i.e., stent, this study has systematically explored how the process parameters affect the final quality of the printed parts. Firstly, the nitinol powders have been validated through various testings on flow property, powder behavior, and size distribution to ensure the reproducibility of nitinol devices. Then the process-microstructure-property relation of nitinol wire was investigated experimentally based on the phase transformation temperature, microstructures, phase or crystalline structures, and nickel-titanium atomic weight percentage. In the last, novel superelastic nitinol stents with two different closed-cell designs were successfully printed using the selected process parameters. A comprehensive mechanical/material characterization and biocompatibility assessment have been conducted on these 3D printed stents. In summary, this preliminary study provided a guideline on how to print thin nitinol medical devices, also demonstrated that with the suitable process parameter, it is highly feasible to use SLM to accurately print thin nitinol devices with high density, uniform strut diameters, adequate superelasticity, and excellent biocompatibility.

When diameter of microfibers decreases to 20 μm, their fracture strains increase up to ∼100% and fracture strength up to ∼100 MPa. The size-dependent behavior of 3D-printed polymer can be mainly attributed to the surface effect and nonuniform distribution of defects. Strength and stiffness of PμSL-printed microlattices can be therefore tailored over a broad range by utilized the microfiber size effect. © 2022 The Author(s).

So, the high energy consumption, inefficient resource usage, and quality of service assurance (QoS) are major challenges for cloud data centers. The dynamic consolidation of Virtual Machines (VMs) is proven to be an efficient way to tackle these issues while reducing energy consumption and improving resource utilization in data centers. It reduces the number of active hosts for energy efficiency by switching under-utilized and idle hosts into lower power mode. So, several heuristics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) based VM consolidation approaches have been published in papers. Most existing approaches rely on the aggressive consolidation of VMs for energy efficiency, thus causing performance degradation and high SLA violation. However, an automated solution is needed to reduce energy consumption and SLA violation by ensuring efficient resource usage in the cloud data center environment. Therefore, this article proposes an energy-efficient autonomous VM consolidation (AVMC) mechanism that has Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based agent for performing VM consolidation decisions. The DRL agent learns the optimal distribution of VMs in the data center, considering energy efficiency and QoS assurance. The real-time workload traces from PlanetLab have been used to validate the proposed mechanism. Experimental results reveal the superiority of the proposed AVMC system over the existing models. AVMC reduced the energy consumption and SLA violation rate significantly. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Cloud computing; Data centers; Energy efficiency; QoS assurance; Reinforcement learning; VM consolidation","Autonomous agents; Data reduction; Deep learning; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Green computing; Quality of service; Virtual machine; Cloud data centers; Cloud-computing; Datacenter; Energy efficient; Energy-consumption; Quality of service assurance assurance; Quality of service assurances; Reinforcement learnings; Resource usage; Virtual machine consolidations; Reinforcement learning","","","","","Institute of Information Communications Technology Planning Evaluation; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2018-0-00749, IITP-2022-2017-0-01633)","This work was partly supported by the Institute of Information Communications Technology Planning Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korean Government (MSIT) ( 2018-0-00749 , Development of Virtual Network Management Technology based on Artificial Intelligence, South Korea ) and the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program, South Korea ( IITP-2022-2017-0-01633 ).

Also, consequently leads to saturation in the ferromagnetic core elements. These factors induce distortions in the voltage and current waveforms as well as a large rise in voltage or current. This paper presents the role of distributed generation (DG) in contributing to ferroresonance investigation reduction in the distribution sector. A high ohmic reactor-shunt limiter (HOR-SL) is introduced as a novel technique based on a negative sequence component to mitigate ferroresonance. The proposed HOR-SL reduces the ferroresonance in distribution system (DS) by no more than 10.5 msec. A PSCAD/EMTDC software is used to model the ferroresonance phenomenon. The simulation results strongly show the effectiveness of using the proposed HOR-SL for limiting ferroresonant oscillations and creating stable orbit in the distribution sector. Case studies verified the effectiveness of the proposed technique in mitigating ferroresonance oscillations and keeping the security of the distribution zone. © 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

A variety of materials and tailored micro/nanostructures have recently been developed to realized stretchable OECTs, however, a solid-state OECT with high elasticity has not been demonstrated to date. Herein, we present a general platform developed for the facile generation of highly elastic all-polymer OECTs with high transconductance (up to 12.7 mS), long-term mechanical and environmental durability, and sustainability. Rapid prototyping of these devices was achieved simply by transfer printing lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS/LiTFSI) microstructures onto a resilient gelatin-based gel electrolyte, in which both depletion-mode and enhancement-mode OECTs were produced using various active channels. Remarkably, the elaborate 3D architectures of the PEDOT:PSS were engineered, and an imprinted 3D-microstructured channel/electrolyte interface combined with wrinkled electrodes provided performance that was retained (> 70%) through biaxial stretching of 100% strain and after 1000 repeated cycles of 80% strain. Furthermore, the anti-drying and degradable gelatin and the self-crosslinked PEDOT:PSS/LiTFSI jointly enabled stability during > 4 months of storage and on-demand disposal and recycling. This work thus represents a straightforward approach towards high-performance stretchable organic electronics for wearable/implantable/neuromorphic/sustainable applications.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2022, The Author(s).","Conducting polymer; Gelatin organohydrogel electrolyte; Organic electrochemical transistor; Soft lithography; Stretchable electronics","Anodes; Flexible electronics; Microstructure; Solid electrolytes; Styrene; Sustainable development; Transconductance; Wearable technology; Broad application; Electrochemical transistors; Engineered interfaces; Gelatin organohydrogel electrolyte; Organic electrochemical transistors; PEDOT/PSS; Performance; Recyclables; Soft-lithography; Stretchable electronics; Conducting polymers","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (21802171, 22075325); Guangzhou Municipal Science and Technology Project, (202002030434)","This work is supported by National Natural Science Fund of China (21802171, 22075325) and Guangzhou Municipal Science and Technology Project (202002030434).

The phase composition, microstructure, and crystal structure of the high-manganese aluminium bronze CuMn13Al7 arc additive manufactured samples were analysed using direct-reading spectrometer, metallographic microscope, scanning electron microscope, and transmission electron microscope. The micro-hardness tester, tensile tester, impact tester, and electrochemical workstation were also used to test the performance of the CuMn13Al7 samples. By studying the microstructure and properties of the CuMn13Al7 samples, it was found that preparation of the samples by the arc additive manufacturing technology ensured good forming quality, almost no defects, and good metallurgical bonding inside the sample. The metallographic structure (α + β + point phase) mainly comprises the following: the metallographic structure in the equiaxed grain region has an obvious grain boundary α; the metallographic structure in the remelting region has no obvious grain boundary α; the thermal influence on the metallographic structure produced a weaker grain boundary α than the equiaxed grain region. The transverse and longitudinal cross sections of the sample had uniform microhardness distributions, and the average microhardness values were 190.5 HV0.1 and 192.7 HV0.1, respectively. The sample also had excellent mechanical properties: yield strength of 301 MPa, tensile strength of 633 MPa, elongation of 43.5%, reduction of area by 58%, Charpy impact value of 68 J/cm2 at – 20 ℃, and dynamic potential polarisation curve test results. Further, it was shown that the average corrosion potential of the sample was – 284.5 mV, and the average corrosion current density was 4.1×10–3 mA/cm2. © 2022, The Author(s).","CuMn13Al7; High-manganese aluminium bronze; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Wire arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Bronze; Corrosion; Grain boundaries; Manganese; Manganese alloys; Microhardness; Phase composition; Scanning electron microscopy; Tensile strength; Textures; Transmission electron microscopy; Additive manufacturing technology; Composition structure; Crystals structures; Direct readings; Equi-axed grains; Grain-boundaries; High-manganese aluminum bronze; Metallographic structure; Wire arc; Wire arc additive manufacturing; Ternary alloys","","","","","University Synergy Innovation Program of Anhui Province, (GXXT-2019-022); Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province, (1908085QE174); Anhui University of Science and Technology, AUST, (RCYJ201905)","Supported by University Synergy Innovation Program of Anhui Province (Grant No. GXXT-2019-022), Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 1908085QE174), and the Talent Program of Anhui Science and Technology University (Grant No. RCYJ201905).

Surface modification over implants has achieved successful implants for enhanced osseointegration. Herein, we report a robust strategy to implement bioactive surface modification for implant interface enabled by the combinatorial system of reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-coated sandblasted, large-grit, and acid-etched (SLA) Ti to impart benefits to the implant. Methods: We prepared SLA Ti (ST) implants with different surface modifications [i.e., rGO and recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2)] and investigated their dental tissue regenerating ability in animal models. We performed comparative studies in surface property, in vitro cellular behaviors, and in vivo osseointegration activity among different groups, including ST (control), rhBMP-2-immobilized ST (BI-ST), rhBMP-2-treated ST (BT-ST), and rGO-coated ST (R-ST). Results: Spectroscopic, diffractometric, and microscopic analyses confirmed that rGO was coated well around the surfaces of Ti discs (for cell study) and implant fixtures (for animal study). Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that the R-ST group showed significantly better effects in cell attachment and proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity, matrix mineralization, expression of osteogenesis-related genes and protein, and osseointegration than the control (ST), BI-ST, and BT-ST groups. Conclusion: Hence, we suggest that the rGO-coated Ti can be a promising candidate for the application to dental or even orthopedic implants due to its ability to accelerate the healing rate with the high potential of osseointegration. © 2022, The Author(s).","Bone tissue engineering; Osteogenesis; Reduced graphene oxide; Surface coating; Titanium","4 carboxyglutamic acid; alizarin red s; alkaline phosphatase; beta actin; cefazolin; chlorhexidine; epigallocatechin gallate; fluorescein isothiocyanate; graphene oxide; membrane protein; osteocalcin; osteopontin; pentobarbital; polyclonal antibody; recombinant bone morphogenetic protein 2; tetramethylrhodamine; titanium; transcription factor RUNX2; vinculin; adherens junction; alveolar ridge; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; atomic force microscopy; bicinchoninic acid assay; biocompatibility; biological activity; bone density; bone development; bone regeneration; bone tissue; calcification; calcium binding; cell adhesion; cell differentiation; cell function; cell proliferation; coating (procedure); controlled study; diffraction; dog; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; enzyme activity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fluorescence microscopy; focal adhesion; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; gene expression; immobilization; immunocytochemistry; immunofluorescence; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; mesenchymal stem cell; micro-computed tomography; microscopy; mineralization; morphometry; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; osseointegration; osteoblast; osteoid; physical chemistry; protein expression; Raman spectrometry; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA isolation; spectroscopy; surface property; tissue engineering; tissue regeneration; torque; upregulation; X ray photoemission spectroscopy","","4 carboxyglutamic acid, 53861-57-7; alizarin red s, 130-22-3, 83-61-4; alkaline phosphatase, 9001-78-9; cefazolin, 25953-19-9, 27164-46-1; chlorhexidine, 3697-42-5, 55-56-1; epigallocatechin gallate, 989-51-5; fluorescein isothiocyanate, 25168-13-2, 27072-45-3, 3326-32-7; osteocalcin, 136461-80-8; osteopontin, 106441-73-0; pentobarbital, 57-33-0, 76-74-4; recombinant bone morphogenetic protein 2, 246539-15-1; tetramethylrhodamine, 70281-37-7; titanium, 7440-32-6","AXIS Supra, Kratos, United Kingdom; BX51, Olympus, Japan; FM40Mk2; Leica DMIL microscope, Leica Microsystems, Germany; NX10, Park Systems, South Korea; Nicolet 560, Nicolet, United States; RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen, United States; Skyscan-1173; SpectraMax 340, Molecular Devices, United States","Kratos, United Kingdom; Leica Microsystems, Germany; Molecular Devices, United States; Nicolet, United States; Olympus, Japan; Park Systems, South Korea; Qiagen, United States","Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE; Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology, KEIT, (20002010, 20014399); Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology, KEIT; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea, MSIT, (2021R1A2C2006013); Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea, MSIT","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2021R1A2C2006013) and the Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology (KEIT) grant funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy (MOTIE, Korea) (No. 20002010 and 20014399).

To illustrate the applicability and accuracy of the method, a high level of accuracy was established for the analytical solutions by comparing the results of the solutions with the numerical solution as well as the already published literature, such as the variational approach (VA), Hamiltonian approach (HA), energy balance method (EBM), and homotopy analysis method (HAM). It is shown that the GRHB method can be easily applied to nonlinear problems and provides solutions with a higher precision than existing methods. The obtained analytical expressions are employed to study the effects of axial force, initial gape, and electrostatic load on nonlinear frequency. © 2022 by the authors.","electrostatically actuated microbeam; iteration/recursive method; non-linear analysis; numerical methods","","","","","","","","Batra R.C., Porfiri M., Spinello D., Electromechanical model of electrically actuated narrow microbeams, J.

Here we report a combined density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics study on the stability of graphene (Gr), phosphorene (Pp) and silicene (Sl) coatings at the most stable (0001) surface of the metals that have hcp structure at room temperature: Hf, Mg, Os, Re, Ru, Sc, Ti, Zn and Zr. We found that the three 2D materials are stable at the surfaces of many of these metals: Gr is stable at Os, Re, Ti, Zn and Zr; Pp is stable in the blue form at Hf, Mg, Ti and Zr; Sl is stable in the 2D zigzag structure at Hf, Mg and Ti and in the planar form at the Zr surface. For the remaining metals Gr, Pp and Sl do not form van der Waals bonded MLs. In those cases we found structures such as 2D arrangements of mixed hexagons and pentagons, trigonal pyramidal structures and 2 half-monolayers. Many of these structures are very stable coatings covalently bound to the surfaces with considerable adsorption energies that can reach − 2 eV per atom of the coating. Gr imparts hydrophobicity to the surfaces of all materials here studied and increases the distance between these and the first H2O layer by as much as 75 % for Gr coated Ti. These H2O layers have increased rigidity despite being located further apart from the surfaces. These effects could be explored for the protection or functionalization of high-performance systems such as metallic electrodes for example. © 2022 The Authors","2D materials; Graphene; Hcp metals, Hf, Mg, Os, Re, Ru, Sc, Ti, Zn and Zr; Hydrophobic; Phosphorene; Silicene","Coatings; Density functional theory; Graphene; Molecular dynamics; Monolayers; Silicene; Stability; Titanium; Titanium compounds; Van der Waals forces; Zinc; 2d material; Atomic layer; Atomic monolayers; Functionalizations; Hcp metal, hf, mg, os, re, ru, sc, ti, zn and zr; Hcp metals; Hydrophobics; Phosphorene; Silicene; Structural stabilities; Hydrophobicity","","","","","Department of Materials Science and Engineering; Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan, KTH; Vetenskapsrådet, VR, (2018-05973)","Funding text 1: The computations were performed on resources provided by the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC) at the PDC Center for High Performance Computing at the KTH—Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, and at the High-Performance Computing Center North (HPC2N), partially funded by the Swedish Research Council through grant agreement no. 2018-05973.

Samples were cut from the upper and lower parts of the additive block and processed in the layer deposition direction using different tool loading forces. Studies have shown that the processing of such material forms a clearly defined thermomechanically affected zone represented by nanosized α-grains. In the stir zone, the material is characterized by a fine-dispersed structure with a content of α- and nanosized α″-phase plates. The material after processing demonstrates 24% higher values of the ultimate tensile strength as compared to the base metal in the as-built state. © 2022 by the authors.","electron beam additive manufacturing; friction stir processing; mechanical properties; microstructure; titanium alloy","","","","","",", (104204); Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (22-29-20172)","This research project was supported by the Russian Science Foundation under grant No 22-29-20172, https://rscf.ru/en/project/22-29-20172/ (accessed on 11 November 2022) and funded by the Administration of the Tomsk Region.","Furuya Y., Takeuchi E., Gigacycle fatigue properties of Ti–6Al–4V alloy under tensile mean stress, Mater.

Our additive manufacturing lab’s capacity to offset these shortages was soon overwhelmed, leading to a need to improve the efficiency of our existing workflow. We undertook a work system analysis guided by the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) construct which is based on human factors and quality improvement principles. Our objective was to understand the inefficiencies in project submission, review, and acceptance decisions, and make systematic improvements to optimize lab operations. Methods: Contextual inquiry (interviews and workflow analysis) revealed suboptimal characteristics of the system, specifically, reliance on a single person to facilitate work and, at times, fractured communication with project sponsors, with root causes related to the project intake and evaluation process as identified through SEIPS tools. As interventions, the analysis led us to: 1) enhance an existing but underused project submission form, 2) design and implement an internal project scorecard to standardize evaluation of requests, and 3) distribute the responsibility of submission evaluation across lab members. We implemented these interventions in May 2021 for new projects and compare them to our baseline February 1, 2018 through – April 30, 2021 performance (1184 days). Results: All project requests were submitted using the enhanced project submission form and all received a standardized evaluation with the project scorecard. Prior to interventions, we completed 35/79 (44%) of projects, compared to 12/20 (60%) of projects after interventions were implemented. Time to review new submissions was reduced from an average of 58 days to 4 days. A more distributed team responsibility structure permitted improved workflow with no increase in staffing, allowing the Lab Manager to devote more time to engineering rather than administrative/decision tasks. Conclusions: By optimizing our workflows utilizing a human factors approach, we improved the work system of our additive manufacturing lab to be responsive to the urgent needs of the pandemic. The current workflow provides insights for labs aiming to meet the growing demand for point-of-care manufacturing. © 2022, The Author(s).","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; COVID-19; Human factors engineering; POC manufacturing; Quality improvement; Work systems","3D printers; Additives; Hospitals; Human resource management; Laboratories; Quality control; Supply chains; 3-D printing; 3D Labs; 3D-printing; Contextual inquiry; Human factor engineerings; Patient safety; POC manufacturing; Quality improvement; Work system; Work-flows; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; hospital design; hospital engineering; hospital planning; human; interview; medical staff; pandemic; product design; three dimensional printing; total quality management; workflow; COVID-19","","","","","","","COVID-19 in the USA, (2020); Optimizing Supply of PPE and Other Equipment during Shortages.

We find that the CDF W-mass disfavors mE1=mE2=mN or sL= sR= 0 where sL(R) is mixing parameter of left (right)-handed fields of vector-like leptons. A large mass splitting between E1 and E2 is favored when the differences between sL and sR becomes small. The muon g- 2 anomaly can be simultaneously explained for appropriate difference between mE1(sL) and mE2(sR) , and some regions are excluded by the diphoton signal data of the 125 GeV Higgs. Combined with the CDF W-mass, muon g- 2 anomaly and other relevant constraints, the correct dark matter relic density is mainly obtained in two different scenarios: (i) XIXI→Z′Z′,SS for mZ′(mS)<mXI and (ii) the co-annihilation processes for min(mE1,mE2,mN,mXR) close to mXI. Finally, we use the direct searches for 2ℓ+ETmiss event at the LHC to constrain the model, and show the allowed mass ranges of the vector-like leptons and dark matter. © 2022, The Author(s).","","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11975013)","We thank Songtao Liu, Shuyuan Guo, Liangliang Shang, Shiyu Wang, and Yang Zhang for the helpful discussions.

In this study, we demonstrate the fabrication of elastic nanocomposites based on encapsulating 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate-modified MXene nanosheets in a photocurable polyurethane acrylate resin (PAR) matrix by digital light processing 3D printing. The mechanical properties of the elastomers are tuned by varying the MXene amount in the PAR. The prepared MXene-PAR nanocomposites containing 0.1% w/w fillers exhibit a tensile strength and elongation at a break of 23.3 MPa and 404.3%, corresponding to an increase of 100.8% and 37.8%, respectively, as compared to the control. Piezoresistive sensors and wearable finger guard sensors are fabricated by coating a MXene-based hydrogel on the surface of the 3D-printed structural parts to determine the printability, mechanical properties, and conductivity. Furthermore, the as-prepared stretchable sensors exhibit long-term working stability.

Improvements in the formulations of multi-component bioink are needed to support cytocompatible encapsulation and biological functions. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP), as a source of patient-specific autologous growth factors, exhibits capabilities in tissue repair and rejuvenation. This study aimed to prepare PRP-integrated alginate-gelatin (AG) composite hydrogel bioinks and evaluate the biological effects in vitro and in vivo. 3D bioprinted constructs embedded with dermal fibroblasts and epidermal stem cells were fabricated using extrusion strategy. The integration of PRP not only improved the cellular behavior of seeded cells, but regulate the tube formation of vascular endothelial cells and macrophage polarization in a paracrine manner, which obtained an optimal effect at an incorporation concentration of 5%. For in-situ bioprinting, PRP integration accelerated the high-quality wound closure, modulated the inflammation and initiated the angiogenesis compared with the AG bioink. In conclusion, we revealed the regenerative potential of PRP, readily available at the bedside, as an initial signaling provider in multi-component bioink development. Combined with in-situ printing technology, it is expected to accelerate the clinical translation of rapid individualized wound repair. © 2022 The Authors","Cell-laden scaffold; In-situ bioprinting; Individualized protein therapy; Platelet-rich plasma; Skin substitute; Wound healing","Cell culture; Endothelial cells; Plasma (human); Platelets; Scaffolds (biology); Bi-layer; Biological functions; Bioprinting; Cell-laden scaffold; In-situ bioprinting; Individualized protein therapy; Multicomponents; Platelet rich plasma; Skin substitutes; Wound healing; Stem cells","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81772071, 81772072, 82172209, 82172210); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by the Xijing Hospital Major Clinical Technology Innovation Projects [ XJZT19Z03 ], and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [ 82172209 , 81772071 , 82172210 , and 81772072 ].

Experimental results showed that the fast solidification induced by high-speed laser scanning resulted in a prior β columnar grain and multistage acicular α' phase within the final solidified microstructure, and that a high energy density could cause the size of β columnar crystals and α' phase to rise. During SLM solidification, different crystallization types were found of the molten pool due to different temperature gradients and heat flow directions. Furthermore, the results indicated that grain size and densification degree, both of which are affected by energy densities, could have a considerable impact on mechanical properties. Additionally, the anisotropy of the material's tensile characteristics was determined by the geometry of the molten pool boundary and the growth direction of the microstructure. As the energy density was selected at the optimal value of 74.07 J/mm3, the largest tensile strength of 1138 MPa with a strain of 5.1% was obtained. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Energy density; Melt pool; Selective laser melting; Titanium alloy","Aluminum alloys; Crystal growth; Crystal microstructure; Density (specific gravity); Melting; Selective laser melting; Tensile strength; Titanium alloys; Columnar grain; Crystal growth mechanism; Energy density; High speed laser; Laser scanning; Melt pool; Microstructure evolutions; Molten pool; Selective laser melting; Titanium (alloys); Solidification","","","","","Chinese Ministry of Education for Equipment Pre-research, (8091B022112); Nanjing Mission New Materials Co.

The most commonly used input geometry file formats are in the form of unstructured triangular meshes. Previous research works have presented different algorithms for slicing an unstructured triangular mesh by a series of uniformly spaced parallel planes. Recent research works show that the use of hashtable data structures results in an optimal algorithm that improves the efficiency of the slicing process. The presented algorithm minimizes the use of hashtable in the slicing process by using graph-based data structures. It was found that the slicing can be sped up by about 10 times by using the graph-based algorithm compared to the previous algorithm. The use of parallel processing on multi-core processors was explored to further speed up the slicing process. The proposed efficient algorithm can be useful in process planning optimization. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Contour construction, 3d printing; Slicing algorithm","","","","","","","","Brown A.C., de Beer D., Development of a stereolithography (STL) slicing and G-code generation algorithm for an entry level 3-D printer, Africon IEEE, pp. 1-5, (2013); Oropallo W., Piegl L.A., Ten challenges in 3D printing, Eng.

However, for TPMS shell structure due to the single connected regions, the porosity and connectivity become limited on the premise of mechanical property. In this study, triangular grid-based design of Gyroid composite porous structure (CPS) and optimized CPS through assigning diameter based on stress distribution were proposed for obtaining higher porosity and improved mechanical properties, following the analysis of curvature distribution characteristics. Afterwards, finite element simulation and quasi-static compression tests were performed for studying the stress distribution and mechanical responses. The results showed that the designed Gyroid CPS with high porosity did not obviously destroy the original curvature characteristic, while strength, modulus and specific energy absorption were enhanced simultaneously. It is expected to provide beneficial inspiration for the design and application of TPMS-based porous structures with the integration of high porosity and mechanical property. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Composite porous structure; Curvature; Energy absorption capacity; Gyroid; Mechanical property","Compression testing; Curve fitting; Energy absorption; Porosity; Structural design; Structural properties; Surface structure; Composite porous structure; Curvature; Energy absorption capacity; Gyroid minimal surface; Gyroids; High porosity; Porous structures; Stresses distribution; Triangular grid; Triply periodic minimal surfaces; Stress concentration","","","","","Open Fund Project of 3D Printing Equipment and Manufacturing Key Laboratory in Jiangsu Province, (3DL202103)","We would like to express gratitude for supporting the research in the field of ceramic stereolithography to Suzhou Key Industrial Technology Innovation Projects (Grant No. SGC2021063 and Grant No. SYG202040 ) and the Open Fund Project of 3D Printing Equipment and Manufacturing Key Laboratory in Jiangsu Province (Grant No. 3DL202103 ).

Over the past decade, this technology has gained ground with the production of parts from SS 316L-Si stainless steel, an industrial product in widespread use. Yet one of the main challenges when extending the use of this technology to the manufacture of medium complexity parts is how to achieve good intersections. This paper focuses on the use of Plasma Arc Welding (PAW) for the additive manufacturing of X-Cross intersections made of SS 316L-Si stainless steel alloy, defining its geometrical suitability and evaluating its productivity. Firstly, two strategies for the production of parts are presented: the energy control strategy on the curved path of a L-shaped wall and the variable amplitude waveform strategy (variable waving) for the continuous production of a X-cross intersection. A metallographic analysis of the samples extracted in the different tests was completed, focusing mainly on the transversal direction. Next, four deposition strategies based on discrete trajectories (cross-overlapping and cross-waving) and on continuous trajectories (waving and overlapping) are addressed in this paper for the production of cross intersections in a part of medium complexity and for the extension of its use in Near-Net-Shape (NNS) manufacturing. The mechanical properties and microstructure of samples manufactured with these deposition strategies are analysed by means of tensile tests and metallographic characterization. An analysis of the deposition energy and of the productivity is carried out for the four strategies. The productivity is analysed by means of different parameters such as the number of layers, the actual deposition rate and process times (deposition time, waiting time, standby time and idle time). The most advantageous strategies in terms of productivity were cross-waving and waving, achieving torch utilization rates relative to total time of 50 %. Methodologies and conditions for the manufacture of X-cross intersections are established. Finally, a study of the cross-intersection geometry obtained for each deposition strategy is performed. From the geometrical analysis of the crosses produced, it has been observed that the ratio of material used in the cross-overlapping sequence to produce a X-cross intersection in relation to the amount of material deposited is more than 10 % higher than in the other strategies. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM); Direct energy deposition; Mechanical properties; Path programing; Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM)","Additives; Alloy steel; Austenitic stainless steel; Deposition rates; Geometry; Microstructure; Productivity; Silicon alloys; Tensile testing; Crossing intersections; Design for additive manufacturing; Direct energy deposition; Directed energy; Energy depositions; Medium complexity; Path programing; SS 316L; Wire arc; Wire arc additive manufacturing; 3D printers","","","","","Eusko Jaurlaritza, (KK-2022/00070, ZL-2021/00989); Eusko Jaurlaritza","The authors thank the Basque Government for funding the EDISON project, through the ELKARTEK 2022 ( KK-2022/00070 ) and the ADDHOC, HAZITEK 2021 ( ZL-2021/00989 ) programs.

The role of the microstructures underpins the difference in fatigue performance between WAAM and hot-rolled materials is investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical metallography, and in-situ acoustic emission. Results show the WAAM low-carbon steel has a lower fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR) comparing with the hot-rolled steel. The mechanisms enhancing the fatigue performance are a lower volume fraction of pearlite and the interlocking basket weave microstructure in WAAM specimens. The anisotropy in the FCGR of WAAM low-carbon steel is very small. © 2022","Acoustic emission; Fatigue; Low-carbon steel; Remanufacturing; Wire and arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Fatigue crack propagation; Growth rate; Hot rolling; Low carbon steel; Microstructure; Scanning electron microscopy; Acoustic-emissions; Emission behavior; Fatigue behaviour; Fatigue crack growth rates; Fatigue performance; Hot-rolled; Low-carbon steels; Manufacturing IS; Remanufacturing; Wire and arc additive manufacturing; Wire","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11872088, 12088101, 2020-JCJQ-JJ-465, 51975546, CAEP CX20200035, U1930403); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","Funding text 1: The study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 11872088, 51975546, U1930403, 12088101), 2020-JCJQ-JJ-465, CAEP CX20200035.

Zn alloys can be used as degradable biomaterials, in contrast to conventional permanent metallic biomaterials. In this work, commercially pure Zn was processed by WAAM to obtain near-dense parts, and the properties obtained through WAAM-processed Zn were compared with wrought (WR) Zn samples. The microstructure and hardness values of the WAAM (41 ± 1 HV0.3) components were found to be similar to those of the WR (35 ± 2 HV0.3) components. Bulk X-ray diffraction texture measurements suggested that WAAM builds exhibit a heavily textured microstructure compared to the WR counterparts, with peak intensities around <3 3–6 2> or <0 0 0 2> in the directions parallel to the build direction (BD). The corrosion rates in simulated body fluid (SBF) were similar for WAAM (0.45 mmpy) and WR (0.3 mmpy) samples. The weight loss measurements in SBF were found to be marginally higher in the WAAM samples compared to the WR counterparts for a duration of up to 21 days. MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts were found to be healthy and proliferating in the culture medium containing the degradation products from WAAM-Zn in a manner similar to WR-Zn. This work establishes the feasibility of processing Zn by WAAM for use in bioresorbable metallic implants. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; metallic biomaterials; resorbable implants; Zn implants","alanine aminotransferase; amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; cholesterol; creatinine; growth differentiation factor 15; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; potassium; sodium; troponin; aged; alanine aminotransferase level; alcohol consumption; all cause mortality; anemia; area under the curve; Article; aspartate aminotransferase level; bilirubin blood level; blood pressure; body mass; cardiovascular mortality; controlled study; coronary angiography; creatinine blood level; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease severity; echocardiography; emergency care; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Europe; female; glucose blood level; heart catheterization; heart ejection fraction; heart failure; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart rate; high density lipoprotein cholesterol level; hospital mortality; hospitalization; human; human cell; hypertension; leukocyte count; low density lipoprotein cholesterol level; lung edema; major clinical study; male; obesity; potassium blood level; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; smoking; sodium blood level; systolic blood pressure; total cholesterol level","","alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; aspartate aminotransferase, 9000-97-9; bilirubin, 18422-02-1, 635-65-4; cholesterol, 57-88-5; creatinine, 19230-81-0, 60-27-5; hemoglobin A1c, 62572-11-6; potassium, 7440-09-7; sodium, 7440-23-5","","","Government of India, (CRG/2021/006468); Science and Engineering Research Board, SERB","This research was funded by Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) of the Government of India (CRG/2021/006468).","Conventry M.B., Tapper E.M., Pelvic Instability: A Consequence of Removing Iliac Bone for Grafting, J.

The process has sensitively released the practice of using expensive dies, making it suitable for manufacturing custom-built products in tiny batches. Further, it is getting acceptance in producing parts of shabby machinery. In recent years, superalloys have become the most commonly used materials in the transportation, automotive, aeronautics and marine industries due to their fundamental and structural applications. The input parameters considered in this study are step size, feed rate and tool spindle speed. The effects of all three process parameters on the geometrical accuracy of Inconel 625 superalloy conical parts formed by the single-point incremental forming process are considered in this work. The deviations in roundness, concentricity, half-cone angle and straightness from the target values were considered as response parameters to measure the accuracy. The results showed that the part accuracy could be enhanced by using minimum step size, feed rate and maximum tool spindle speed. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.","accuracy; concentricity; half-cone angle; Inconel 625 superalloy; roundness; Single-point incremental forming; straightness","Machinery; Marine applications; Marine industry; Materials handling; Metal forming; Sheet metal; Accuracy; Concentricity; Cone angle; Geometrical accuracy; Half-cone angle; Inconel 625 superalloys; Roundness; Single point incremental forming; Step size; Straightness; Superalloys","","","","","","","Jeswiet J., Asymmetric incremental sheet forming, Adv.

This paper attempts to solve these problems by improving both the hardware and the algorithm. Theoretically, to overcome the limitations of beam waist radius, the amplitude profile function of large topological charge Laguerre–Gaussian (LG) beam is properly improved. Then, an experimental system employing a 4K phase-only SLM is set up, and the LG beams with topological charge up to 1200 are successfully generated. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of different beam waist radii on the generation of LG beams. Additionally, the function of the LG beam is further improved to generate an LG beam with a topological charge as high as 1400. Our results set a new benchmark for generating large topological charge vortex beams, which can be widely used in precise measurement, sensing, and communication. © 2022 Chinese Optics Letters.","computer-generated hologram; Laguerre–Gaussian beam; large topological charge; spatial light modulator","Computer generated holography; Electron holography; Gaussian beams; Gaussian distribution; Holograms; Light modulation; Topology; Vortex flow; Beam waist radius; Computergenerated holograms (CGH); Encoding algorithms; Laguerre Gaussian beams; Large topological charge; Phase-only; Profile functions; Spatial light modulators; Topological charges; Vortex beams; Light modulators","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (2019-JCJQ-ZD, 61805283, 62173342); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 62173342 and 61805283) and the Key Research Projects of Foundation Strengthening Program (No. 2019-JCJQ-ZD).","Allen L., Beijersbergen M.

The effects of the equivalent width, filling situation and geometrical properties of the crack on the wave propagation are analyzed based on the scattered surface wave signals. The scattering process of the source due to an irregular surface crack is implemented by the staggered grid finite difference method (SG-FDM). The complex boundary conditions on the crack surface are classified by a modified stress image method (SIM) with a series of cells. A well comparison result is presented between SG-FDM and the finite element method. Three typical models are designed to analyze the effects of the crack width and filling material on Rayleigh waves. Furthermore, we focus on the influences of the effective width spatial variation characteristics of an irregular crack on Rayleigh wave propagation with different crack depth-wavelength ratios. The energy distribution of the scattered Rayleigh waves depends on the crack average width and the integrity of the filling material after damage repair. Our study reveals the specific wave phenomena (e.g., crack width-dependent and filling condition-dependent scattered waves) influenced by the crack interior structures, and this provides a method for detecting the subsurface structures (e.g., variation of crack width along the depth direction) of a breaking crack and evaluating the repair quality regarding local defects. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Crack width; Numerical modeling; Quality evaluation; Rayleigh waves","Cracks; Filling; Rayleigh waves; Repair; Surface defects; Surface scattering; Wave propagation; Crack-width; Equivalent width; Filling materials; Finite-difference methods; Geometrical property; Numerical approaches; Quality evaluation; Staggered-grids; Surface cracks; Wave response; Finite difference method","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41804127)","This work is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41804127 ).

With the developments in Additive Manufacturing (AM), lattice structures can now be fabricated with limited manufacturing constraints, which facilitates the design of lattice structures to become more flexible. In this paper, a novel lattice generation strategy is proposed to design graded lattice structures with the assistance of Machine Learning (ML). A Neural Network (NN)-based inverse lattice generator is trained to output lattice unit cells from the input of target mechanical properties. The proposed ML-based lattice generation method utilises the density distribution and stress field of low-resolution Topology Optimisation (TO) design to inform the inverse generator and produce lattice cells. The efficiency and efficacy of this method and the influence of cell types are demonstrated with the MBB-beam design case. Furthermore, the developed ML-based method is also applicable to multiple cell types. © 2022 The Authors","Graded lattices; Inverse lattice generator; Machine learning; Topology optimisation","Biomechanics; Cells; Cytology; Inverse problems; Manufacture; Shape optimization; Topology; Generation method; Graded lattice; Inverse lattice generator; Lattice generations; Lattice structures; Lightweighting; Machine-learning; Manufacturing constraint; Neural-networks; Topology optimisation; Machine learning","","","","","","","Tao W., Leu M.C., (2016); Deshpande V.S., Fleck N.A., Ashby M.F., Effective properties of the octet-truss lattice material, J.

However, a complete continuous strain–time curve of SL needs to be converted into assumed curve clusters supposing obtained under RL before the deformation data are used to develop creep constitutive models. Classical methods realize the conversion mainly by focusing on the creep deformation parts and classifying them into linear and nonlinear compositions. Mostly, the linear parts are simply superposed while the nonlinear parts are complex to consider and so are neglected. Moreover, classical methods are not sufficiently valid to eliminate the stress history effect on the conversion. Here, a new method is proposed to achieve the conversion without neglecting the stress history effect. The method rebuilds the triaxial creep test mathematically and physically, adhering to the revising of energy. The method treats the tested deformation in its entirety, instead of distinguishing it into elastic, visco-elastic, plastic and creep (linear and nonlinear) deformation to convert respectively. The comparison among actual measured SL and RL strain–time curves and the curves converted by the new method proves the stress history effect should not be neglected. The higher the vertical load level, the larger the discrepancy between the RL and SL strain–time curve, and the disparity becomes larger with time. The new method highlights the necessity of considering the stress history effect in analysis and design for higher accuracy. The comparisons illustrate the conversion method at least produces more satisfactory results for clayey soil. Primarily examined, at the later stages of loading, the disparity in strain between the converted RL and measured RL decreases by 52.5%~53.5% compared with strain between the measured SL and measured RL. © 2022 by the authors.","creep; respective loading; soft soil; stepwise loading; strain–time curve","","","","","","Harbin Institute of Technology, HIT; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41672287); China Scholarship Council, CSC, (202106120229)","This research was funded by [National Natural Science Foundation of China] grant number [41672287] and the APC was funded by [Harbin Institute of Technology].

The demodulation method using a synchronous frequency filter (SFF) instead of a bandpass filter (BPF) and a high pass filter (HPF) is proposed. The structure and transfer function of SFFs are introduced, and their characteristics are simulated and analyzed. Therefore, the center frequency of SFFs can be adaptively adjusted according to the estimated rotational speed, which is convenient for frequency setting. Finally, according to the proposed rotating high-frequency voltage injection method, the simulation model is built. The experimental results verify that the control strategy can maintain good position estimation accuracy, better speed tracking performance and anti-load disturbance performance. © 2022 by the authors.","interior permanent magnet synchronous motor; position sensorless control; rotating high-frequency voltage injection method; synchronous frequency filter","","","","","","Huai’an Key Laboratory of motion control and converter technology, (HAP201903); Natural Science Foundation of Huai’an City, (HAB201905, HAB202062); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (BK20181481); Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province, (2019-GDZB-238)","This research was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, grant number BK20181481, in part by the Six Categories Talent Peak of Jiangsu Province under Grant Nos. 2019-GDZB-238, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Huai’an City under Grant Nos.

Cu-Fe-P specimens were subjected to 20, 40, 60, and 80% reduction ratios (RR) through room-temperature rolling (RTR). Nano-sized Fe2P precipitates were observed in the initial and deformed specimens. Continuous-rolling deformation causes strain hardening, whereas exposing severely deformed specimens to RT causes the self-annealing phenomenon. Deformed specimens to 60 and 80% RRs exhibited strain localizations (SLs) that formed only in Copper-type grains. In this study, a visco-plastic self-consistent (VPSC) polycrystal model was used to calculate the relative slip activity for major texture orientations. Copper-type grains showed the occurrence of predominant single-slip system which was the primary reason for the formation of SLs. Static recovery (SRV) and static recrystallization (SRX) were the main softening phenomena found in the RTR specimens. Both discontinuous SRX (DSRX) and continuous SRX (CSRX) were observed as the SRX phenomenon in RTR specimens. Major SRX grains were elongated in shape due to the combined effects of a higher orientation gradient (CSRX), to the larger SE differences between the matrix grains (restricted growth), and to a pinning effect by Fe2P particles. The as-received specimen showed weak plane-strain texture components at maxima around the S component ((123)<634>). As the RR increased, the volume fractions of Copper ((112)<111>), Brass ((110)<112>), and S components were likewise increased (except at 60% RR). The highest fraction of plane-strain components was observed for the RTR-80 specimen. The large number of SLs and the higher orientation gradient decreased the intensity of the plane-strain texture in the RTR-60 specimen, whereas a higher fraction of SRX in the RTR-80 specimen enhanced the plane-strain texture components. Time-dependent decay in the hardness values in the RTR specimens were attributed to SRV and SRX.  © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.","Cu-Fe-P; DSRX; Fe<sub>2</sub>P; Room temperature rolling; Self-annealing; Texture","Annealing; Copper alloys; Iron alloys; Rolling; Strain; Strain hardening; Textures; Cu-fe-P; Deformed specimen; Discontinuous SRX; Plane strains; Reduction ratios; Room temperature rolling; Self-annealing; Static recovery; Strain localizations; Texture evolutions; Room temperature","","","","","Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE, (20013652); Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE","This work was funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE, Korea) and also was supported by the Industrial Technology Innovation Program (Grant number: 20013652 ).

With the assistance of the distributed intrinsic feedback mechanism structure (DIFMS) and Brillouin amplification, the maximum linewidth–compression ratio of the fiber laser could be as high as 334 when a broader pump laser with 1 MHz linewidth was used. The formation process of linewidth compression and SLM laser output was also theoretically analyzed. The fiber laser exhibited a high laser efficiency of 21.5% owing to the enhanced Rayleigh scattering fiber (ERSF), which acted as the key element of DIFMS. In addition, the fiber laser with ERSF showed a flexible wavelength tunability from 1535 nm to 1565 nm and a good temporal stability with the maximum power fluctuation of less than 0.3 dB during an hour. These results revealed that the proposed DIFMS applicable to other gain-type lasers as a mechanism structure has great applications in suppressing longitudinal modes and further compressing the linewidth of laser. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Fiber laser; Nonlinear optics; Small-core fiber; Stimulated Brillouin scattering","Efficiency; Fibers; Linewidth; Nonlinear optics; Pumping (laser); Stimulated Brillouin scattering; Brillouin; Brillouin amplification; Core fibre; Feedback mechanisms; Laser efficiency; Linewidth compression; Mechanism structure; Random fibers; Single longitudinal mode; Small-core fiber; Fiber lasers","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61875094); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2018 M642386); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Ningbo University, NBU","This paper was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61875094 ), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2018 M642386), and K.

However, most microscopes only have discrete zoom rates. In this paper, a continuous optical zoom microscope with extended depth of field and 3D reconstruction is demonstrated for the first time. It consists of a zoom objective lens, a microscope holder, an adjustable three-dimensional object stage, an Abbe condenser and an LED light source. The zoom objective lens is composed of several liquid lenses and solid lenses. By adjusting the applied voltage to the liquid lens, the proposed microscope can achieve a large continuous magnification from 10? to 60?. Moreover, an improved shape from focus (SFF) algorithm and image fusion algorithm are designed for 3D reproduction. Based on the liquid lenses, the axial focusing position can be adjusted to obtain images with different depths, and then the extended depth of field and 3D reconstruction can be realized. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed microscope. The proposed microscope is expected to be applied in the fields of pathological diagnosis, biological detection, etc. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Cell proliferation; Diagnosis; Image enhancement; Image fusion; Image reconstruction; Light sources; Liquids; Optical instrument lenses; 3D reconstruction; Confocal microscopes; Extended depth of field; Field reconstruction; Fluorescence microscopes; Life-sciences; Liquid lens; Objective lens; Optical zoom; Two photon; Microscopes","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61927809, 62175006); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (4222069); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos: 61927809 and 62175006.

Introducing ductile metal particles into the brittle ceramic matrix is an effective technique to enhance the geometrical accuracy and mechanical properties of the printed part. In the current research, the Direct Ink Writing technique is used to fabricate alumina-based matrix composite reinforced with Al particles by negative additive manufacturing. A homogenous cermet mixture in the form of Al2O3-Al with various Al compositions (5 vol%, 10 vol%, 15 vol%, and 20. vol%) was achieved by high-energy ball milling. A slurry was prepared by mixing the milled powder with the carboxymethyl cellulose binder and sodium silicate in the deionized water. Rheological measurements of all the slurries were carried out to investigate the shear-thinning behavior of the pastes. The slurry was cast into the polylactic acid mold as the mold was built up layer by layer simultaneously using a Mitsubishi robotic manipulator. The printed parts were dried, demolded by dissolving in Dichloromethane (DCM) solution, and sintered at 1400 °C for 6 h. X-ray diffraction results revealed two distinguished phases (ceramic and metal) in the finished part. It is possible to formulate printable alumina-aluminum cermet slurries with solid content as high as 50 vol% and 97 % density. It was found that by the inclusion of metallic Al phase, the micro-hardness reduces as compared to monolithic alumina ceramic. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> -Al; Cermet; Direct Ink Writing (DIW); High Energy Ball Milling; Hydrogen Inhibitor; Metal Particle Densifier; Negative Additive Manufacturing","Additives; Aluminum Oxide; Geometry; Grinding; Machining; Molds; Additives; Alumina; Aluminum; Aluminum oxide; Ball milling; Deionized water; Geometry; Industrial research; Microhardness; Milling (machining); Molds; Silicates; Sodium compounds; Al2O3 -al; Direct ink writing; High porosity; High-energy ball milling; Hydrogen inhibitor; Manufacturing IS; Metal particle; Metal particle densifier; Negative additive manufacturing; Solid loading; 3D printers","","","","","Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu, TÜBİTAK, (118C141)","The authors appreciate the support for this research from Arçelik AŞ and the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK Project No: 118C141 ).","Ye Z., Chu C., Zhang D., Ma S., Guo J., Cheng Y., Xu G., Li Z., Sun A., Study on 3D-Direct Ink Writing based on adding silica submicron-particles to improve the rheological properties of alumina ceramic ink, Mater.

This technique offers great additive manufacturing capabilities with shape complexity and material versatility. In this paper, we present a thorough analysis of the ability of FIM to process a variety of ceramic feedstocks and evaluate samples of different geometries with increasing geometrical complexity. The materials selected are zirconia, alumina and Pb-free piezoelectrics (BaTiO3 and (Bi, Na)TiO3 – BaTiO3). Injection molding simulations are used to optimize the processing parameters. The quality of the fabricated ceramic parts is assessed by the microstructure, macro-defects, the geometrical features of the structural ceramics and the piezoelectric performance of BaTiO3 and (Bi, Na)TiO3 – BaTiO3. The effect of green- and sintered-density, linear shrinkage (associated with sintering), and shape distortion are also discussed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Ceramic injection molding; Digital light processing; Freeform Geometries; Functional ceramics; Piezoceramics","Additives; Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Barium titanate; Bismuth compounds; Geometry; Injection molding; Lead compounds; Shrinkage; Sintering; Sodium compounds; Titanium oxides; Zirconia; Ceramic injection molding; Different geometry; Digital light processing; Freeform geometry; Freeforms; Functional ceramics; Manufacturing capability; Piezo-ceramics; Piezoelectric; Shape complexity; 3D printers","","","","","Danish Technological Institute; Fraunhofer IKTS; Meggitt A/S; Villum Fonden, (37520); Villum Fonden; Innovationsfonden, IFD, (9065-00196B); Innovationsfonden, IFD; European Commission, EC; Horizon 2020, (849119); Horizon 2020; Safran","Funding text 1: This work has received funding from Innovation Fund Denmark (IFD) (Denmark) in the framework of an Industrial PhD program [File No. 9065-00196B], VILLUM FONDEN (Denmark) [grant no. 37520] and the Horizon 2020 (EU) research and innovation program [grant No. 849119] for industrial research collaborations.
