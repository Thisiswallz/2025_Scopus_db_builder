The microstructure of the fabricated thick wall part has been analysed in various regions. The microstructure at the top, intermediate, and bottom regions result in equiaxed, cellular, and columnar dendrites. Microsegregation was evaluated in the interdendritic regions of the top, intermediate, and bottom surfaces and in travel and build directions. Further in electron backscatter diffraction investigates the texture and microstructure of materials by utilising the inverse pole figure and grain boundary maps in travel and build directions. Also, as compared to low angle grain boundaries, the fraction of high angle grain boundaries is higher in build direction than travel direction. Further, residual stress analysis exhibits the tensile residual stress in the travel direction compared to build direction and compressive stresses were induced in the top region of the deposited part in the build direction. Also, no substantial deviations of microhardness values were in multiple as-deposited regions. Typically, the tensile properties of the material vary significantly across various direction such as horizontal, vertical and inclined. The higher tensile strength observed in the horizontal direction (745 ± 6.2 MPa) compared to vertical and inclined directions. This study provides better insights into the additively manufactured nickel-based superalloy's microstructure, residual stress and mechanical properties.

Self-leveling mortar (SLM) is a material used in floors because it is able to flow and fill a base area without using extra energy. The present studied SLMs using porcelain insulator waste (PIW) as partial and total sand replacement. Different methods were used to characterize the PIW (e.g. X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and pozzolanic activity index) and tests were made in SLMs in fresh and hardened states. XRD results revealed that PIW presented pozzolanic characteristics and increased the compressive strength of mortars. Tests also not verified alkali-aggregate reaction (AAR) when PIW was added. SLMs containing PIW presented compressive and flexural strengths of 24.11 MPa and 7.07 MPa, respectively.

Nevertheless, only limited models are available to predict the initial parameter window for the processing parameters. Using AlCoCrFeNi MPEA as a testbed for laser metal deposition, we present a framework correlating material properties to processing variables coupling predictions from fundamental molecular simulations and meta-heuristic optimization approaches. A set of dimensionless objective functions are constructed to connect elemental diffusion and atomic radii to the macroscopic process parameters, viz., cooling rate, energy density and powder deposition density. Our results suggest that the diffusion coefficient varies exponentially with cooling rate, when the MPEA assumes a crystalline phase upon solidification due to the formation of crystal point defects and a high activation energy rate required for diffusion during rapid cooling. However, the absence of these defects in an amorphous phase of the alloy renders no definitive correlation for the elemental diffusion coefficients with varying cooling rates. Through a multi-objective cuckoo search optimization, we construct a Pareto front to identify optimal values for processing variables, which concur with the parameters adopted in the literature for laser cladding of complex alloys. © 2022 The Author(s)","additive manufacturing;

However, the development of new composite powder for additive manufacturing requires an in-depth understanding of its key characteristics prior to its use in the fabrication process. This paper focuses on the low-energy ball milling (LEBM) of aluminium 2024 alloy (AA2024) reinforced with graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs). The main aim is to investigate the effect of the milling time (from 0.5 to 16 h) on the morphology and flowability of the powder. The study shows that, while short milling times (under 2 h) could not break the Van der WaRals forces between nanoparticles, GNPs were well separated and sufficiently covered the powder surface after 4 h of milling, thanks to the continuously applied impact energy. Longer milling time provides increasingly similar flowability results, confirmed by both the experimental work and discrete element model (DEM) simulations. Moreover, the ball milling process decreases the crystallite size of the milled powder by 24%, leading to a 3% higher microhardness. Lastly, the surface energy of the powder was determined as 1.4 mJ/m2 by DEM, using the angle of repose of the as-received powder from experimental work. © 2022 by the authors.","aluminium 2024 alloy; ball milling parameters; discrete element model; graphene nanoplatelets; powder characterization","","","","","","ASTUTE 2020; Ministry of National Education of Turkey; Llywodraeth Cymru; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","This research is supported by the Ministry of National Education of Turkey and ASTUTE 2020 (Advanced Sustainable Manufacturing Technologies).

The project focused on a Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning application and used an industry-standard copper/aluminum heat exchanger manufactured with conventional technology as the basis for assessing performance. The manufacturing constraints associated with using deposition-based AM technology for this application include the need for a continuous tool path within each build layer that allows uninterrupted extrusion and therefore defect-free water channel walls that correspond to a reliably leak-tight heat exchanger. A geometry that respects these constraints was developed, simulated, optimized and finally manufactured and tested. The material used was a composite of polymer filled with conductive flakes in order to provide high conductivity in the direction that heat must flow in this heat exchanger, across the wall separating the fluids. The measured performance for several test coupons matched the predicted performance and the test coupons exhibited performance that approach and in some cases exceeds conventional technology.

This article proposes a new resonant modular multilevel dc-dc converter (MMDC) based on the conventional boost converter. The single-switch and diode of the conventional boost topology are replaced by submodules (SMs), which are clamped by floating capacitors, and the inductor is replaced by switched-inductor (SL) cells. The phase-shifted pulsewidth modulation (PS-PWM) is applied to regulate the state of SMs, i.e., inserted state or bypassed state, to ensure that there is a constant number of SMs supporting the output voltage at any time. The converter is operated in resonant mode with resonance between capacitors of SMs and the upper arm inductor. The step-up conversion ratio is dependent on the inductors charging ratio, the number of SMs, and SL cells. Hence, more regulation schemes are available. The proposed converter possesses the advantages of MMDC and has the inherent-balancing capability of SM capacitor voltages without additional complex balancing control. The structure of the converter, operating mode analysis, parameter design, and comparison with other MMDCs are presented, which have been verified by simulated and experimental results.  © 2021 IEEE.","DC-DC converter; high step-up conversion; high-voltage direct-current (HVDC); modular multilevel converters (MMCs); switched-inductor (SL)","Boost converter; Electric inductors; Electric inverters; HVDC power transmission; Pulse width modulation; Renewable energy resources; Topology; DC/DC power converters; High step-up conversion; High step-ups; High-Voltage Direct Current; High-voltage direct-current; Inductor; Insulatedgate bipolar transistor (IGBTs); Modular multilevel converter; Modulars; Multilevel converter; Switched inductors; Switched-inductor (SL); Up-conversion; Voltage control","","","","","","","Riedel P., Harmonic voltage and current transfer, and AC- and DC-side impedances of HVDC converters, IEEE Trans.

One of the major drawbacks of this process is the reduction of the mechanical properties of the parts compared with those made by conventional manufacturing methods such as injection molding. On the one hand, this reduction of properties is linked to the presence of macroporosities in the part and, on the other hand, to the limited adhesion between the deposited layers. These two phenomena strongly depend on the thermal history of the polymer. This work proposes to determine the thermal conditions leading to sufficient adhesion, and to the manufacture of parts with sufficient final interfilament strength. An instrumented bench was developed from a 3D printer in order to investigate the cooling, at the filament scale, of parts printed in PEKK material. In parallel, heat transfers in the material extrusion process were simulated using a model, which was validated with the experimental data obtained using the bench. The adhesion was also modeled by describing the phenomena of coalescence and healing of the interface. The physical properties necessary for the models were characterized taking into consideration their thermodependency. A parametric study then quantifies the influence of each parameter on the temperature of the polymer, as well as on the interlayer adhesion, thus contributing to the definition of the process window. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Coalescence; Fused filament fabrication (FFF); Heat transfer; Interface Healing; PEKK","3D printers; Adhesion; Coalescence; Extrusion; Injection molding; % reductions; Additive manufacturing process; Adhesion predictions; Extrusion process; Fused filament fabrication; High performance polymer; Interface healing; Molten polymers; PEKK; Temperature prediction; Heat transfer","","","","","Find A Cure Today Breast Cancer Foundation, FBCF; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, CNRS; Université de Nantes, (ANR-10-AIRT-02); Université de Nantes","Funding text 1: This study is part of the FACT project managed by IRT Jules Verne (French Institute of Research and Technology in Advanced Manufacturing Technologies for Composite, Metallic, and Hybrid Structures).

We answer this question by providing a brief review of the evolution of technologies and operations management (OM) over time. Because terms such as “Industry 4.0” do not have a precise definition, we focus on more fundamental issues raised by Industry 4.0 emerging technologies for research in OM. We propose a theory of disruptive debottlenecking and the SACE framework by classifying emerging technologies in terms of the functionalities they enable: sense, analyze, collaborate, and execute. Subsequently, we review the nascent but rapidly growing literature at the interface between digital technologies and OM. Our review suggests that one way to assess the value of Industry 4.0 technologies can be via their influence on adding revenues, differentiating, reducing costs, optimizing risks, innovating, and transforming business models and processes. Finally, we conclude by proposing an agenda for further research. © 2022 Production and Operations Management Society.","additive manufacturing; artificial intelligence (AI); blockchain; business excellence; digital transformation; governance; Industry 4.0; information technology (IT); internet of things (IOT); operations; strategy; supply chain management","","","","","","","","Agrawal M., Eloot K., Mancini M., Patel A., Industry 4.0: Reimagining manufacturing operations after COVID-19, (2020); Al-Rakhami M.S., Al-Mashari M., Blockchain and Internet of Things for business process management: Theory, challenges, and key success factors, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 11, 10, pp. 552-562, (2020); Anderson E.W., Fornell C., Rust R.T., Customer satisfaction, productivity, and profitability: Differences between goods and services, Marketing Science, 16, 2, pp. 129-145, (1997); Babich V., Hilary G., Distributed ledgers and operations: What operations management researchers should know about blockchain technology, Manufacturing & Service Operations Management, 22, 2, pp. 223-240, (2020); Bardhan I.R., Mithas S., Lin S., Performance impacts of strategy, information technology applications, and business process outsourcing in US manufacturing plants, Production and Operations Management, 16, 6, pp. 747-762, (2007); Bardhan I.R., Whitaker J., Mithas S., Information technology, production process outsourcing and manufacturing plant performance, Journal of Management Information Systems, 23, 2, pp. 13-40, (2006); Barringer S.N., Eliason S.R., Leahey E., A history of causal analysis in the social sciences, Handbook of causal analysis for social research, pp. 9-26, (2013); Baumers M., Holweg M., On the economics of additive manufacturing: experimental findings, Journal of Operations Management, 65, 8, pp. 794-809, (2019); Amazon warehouse robots ‘increase staff injuries’, (2020); Ben-Daya M., Hassini E., Bahroun Z., Banimfreg B., The role of internet of things in food supply chain quality management: A review, Quality Management Journal, 28, 1, pp. 17-40, (2020); Bendoly E., System dynamics understanding in projects: Information sharing, psychological safety, and performance effects, Production and Operations Management, 23, 8, pp. 1352-1369, (2014); Boysen N., Briskorn D., Fedtke S., Schwerdfeger S., Drone delivery from trucks: Drone scheduling for given truck routes, Networks, 72, 4, pp. 506-527, (2018); Bravo R.Z.B., Leiras A., Oliveira F.L.C., The use of UAVs in humanitarian relief: An application of POMDP-based methodology for finding victims, Production and Operations Management, 28, 2, pp. 421-440, (2019); Cachon G., Terwiesch C., Matching supply with demand: An introduction to operations management, (2006); Chandler A.D., Cortada J.W., A nation transformed by information, (2000); Chandler A.D., The visible hand: The managerial revolution in American business, (1977); Chang X., Huang Y., Li M., Bo X., Kumar S., Efficient detection of environmental violators: A big data approach, Production and Operations Management, 30, 5, pp. 1246-1270, (2021); Chen L., Cui Y., Lee H.L., Retailing with 3D printing, Production and Operations Management, 30, 7, pp. 1986-2007, (2021); Christensen C.M., Exploring the limits of the technology S-curve.

In this work, we focus on fabricating graphene TPMS lattices, viz., Gyroid, Schoen's I-WP (IWP), and Diamond, and investigate their multifunctional properties experimentally and computationally. The three-dimensional (3D) graphene structures were synthesized using a self-assembly hydrothermal-assisted dip-coating technique and the resulting lattices were tested for their mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties and compared to finite element simulation results. The graphene TPMS lattices resulting from the fabrication take the topology of a new class of TPMS architectures that are referred to here as the TPMS tube-networks. IWP demonstrated the highest elastic modulus as well as electrical and thermal conductivities. This study shows that 3D porous tube graphene can be utilized in designing new lightweight structural materials of low density with controllable thermal and electrical properties and mechanical strength with a potential to be employed in multifunctional engineering applications.  © 2022 Author(s).","","3D printers; Additives; Cellular manufacturing; Thermal conductivity; Thermal Engineering; Cellular material; Computational modelling; Graphene lattices; Lattice-based; Manufacturing IS; Multifunctional properties; Surface lattice; Surface-based; Thermal and electrical properties; Triply periodic minimal surfaces; Graphene","","","","","Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research, KU, (RCII-2019-003)","The authors acknowledge research funding provided by Khalifa University through Award No. RCII-2019-003.

In this regard, the ever-increasing practices of additive manufacturing (AM) in construction have presented a variety of advantages and are deemed one of the critical technologies for the concept of Construction 4.0. Building information modeling (BIM) as an enabler for the digital transformation in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) domain provides a framework for considering novel AM methods during the early stages of architectural design. It is known that decisions during early design stages significantly impact the subsequent planning and construction phases, whereas missing AM knowledge by architects and engineers could in turn impede the adoption of AM technologies when the early determination of appropriate manufacturing methods needs to be made. Meanwhile, the early stages of architectural design are characterized by vagueness, uncertainty, and incompleteness, which have to be clarified iteratively by both architects and domain experts. To this end, this paper introduces a knowledge-driven design decision support that prospectively incorporates an adaptive feedback mechanism under the BIM methodology. As such, architects can be assisted in choosing appropriate construction methods during the early stages of architectural design. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing in construction; BIM; design decision support; semantic web","","","","","",", (106078); ; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (FOR 2363, 414265976—TRR 277); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG","Funding text 1: We also gratefully acknowledge the support of the DFG for funding the project under grant FOR 2363. ; Funding text 2: This research was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)\u2014Project Number 414265976\u2014TRR 277.

RPC will also aid in improves the error vector magnitude (EVM) and reduces adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) in OFDM communication system. The proposed RPC design methodology and practical implementation using field programmable gate array (FPGA) are discussed. The proposed RPC has been demonstrated using VIRTEX-7 XC7Z100 dual-core FPGA device with less hardware difficulty and minimum utilization of FPGA resources. The proposed RPC improves the efficiency of OFDM communication process by reducing complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) with respect to instantaneous power in dB. A comparison analysis was done between the existing selective mapping (SLM) method with proposed RPS method with respect FPGA resource utilization. The proposed RPC is implemented using VIRTEX-7 XC7Z100 dual-core FPGA device. Its effectively utilizing sub-carriers, fast Fourier transform (FFT) filter, bandwidth, and sampling frequency.

This results in millions of individual laser beam scanning vectors when fabricating complex metal parts, and in most build scenarios, the laser turns on and off at the beginning and end of each vector, respectively. The standard configuration for LPBF machines includes a laser beam steering system with two mirrors attached to galvanometers, called the scanner. Most commercial lasers have response times for beam power control below 10 µs yet acceleration/deceleration times of commercial scanners are an order of magnitude slower (due to the dynamics of the mechanical system). A common strategy for allowing the scanner to “catch up” with the commanded location and speed is to employ “skywriting” with additional built-in time delays to allow for the scanner to maintain constant velocity while the laser is on. These delays along with skywriting are intended to increase resolution and reduce defects, although the actions and times are typically not accessible by the user. In fact, the millions of laser on/off events result in additional sources for defect generation to include lack of fusion voids, keyhole voids, surface roughness, and spatter. Ultimately, this results in differences in part performance within builds (build location) and between LPBF platforms. Recent work has identified methods to eliminate some forms of laser on/off defects by controlling the laser power ramp rate. To the authors knowledge, laser power ramping is not currently implemented on any commercial LPBF machine, and the use of laser power ramping has yet to be evaluated on realistic, complex parts. As a result, the current work implemented laser power ramping on a commercial LPBF machine using a complicated geometry with 1,309,338 laser on/off events (vectors) to analyze the holistic impact of fabricating real parts on defects, mechanical properties, and spatter. Ramping the laser power over 300µs eliminated the formation of back spatter, and a demonstration build of a complex qualification test artifact using IN718 reduced total spatter by nearly 5%. However, this laser power ramp change over 300µs (i.e., linearly varying laser power from 0 W to the desired power set point over 300µs) increased lack of fusion defects near part edges that reduced the tensile ductility from 17% to 12% without affecting tensile strength. The research highlighted the financial challenges imposed when scrutinizing microsecond level interactions, and as a result, a low-cost method to identify minimum ramp rates to prevent back spatter using a smart phone and an optical microscope was demonstrated. Microsecond control over the laser must be accompanied by microsecond control of the scanner and the impacts must be quantified holistically over a variety of response variables to broadly apply the developments to industry applications.1 © 2022 The Authors","Defects; Laser Beam Power Ramping; Meltpool; Qualification Test Artifact; Spatter","Defects; Laser beams; Laser mirrors; Powder metals; Power control; Surface roughness; Laser beam power; Laser beam power ramping; Laser powders; Laser power; Meltpool; Powder bed; Power ramping; Qualification test; Qualification test artifact; Spatter; Scanning","","","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (80NSSC19M0123); National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA; National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST; U.S. Department of Commerce, DOC; Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL, (70NANB21H006, FA8650-20-2-5700); Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL; University of Texas at El Paso, UTEP","The research described here was performed at The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) within the W.M.

The irregular shape and hardness of the as-received powders are identified as a primary obstacle to the successful printability which demonstrated 0% deposition efficiency. Thus, different annealing procedures are suggested as an optimization technique to facilitate printing. These annealing procedures are compared and contrasted using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the hardness/printability of the annealed powders are correlated exactly to the enthalpies in the low temperature i.e., <300 °C region. The annealing procedure of 300 °C for 4h (referred to as the C4 powder) is found to be the most optimal based on the combination of hardness, deposition efficiency, porosity and enthalpy values. On printing, the C4 powder also shows the best combination of good quality edge spraying, highest deposition efficiency of 59% and low porosity of 1.80%. Finally, while the microstructure of the C4 powder particles is retained in the microstructure of the printed part, the hardness of the printed part is higher than that of the C4 powder. This is attributed to a combination of deformation strain induced within the interparticle boundaries during the cold spray process and excellent interparticle interlocking. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Al7075; Aluminium; Ball milled powders; Cold spray","","","","","","","","Assadi H., Kreye H., Gartner F., Klassen T., Cold spraying – a materials perspective, Acta.

One of the important parameters to characterize the heat conduction capacity of porous sintered silver is the thermal conductivity. In this paper, a numerical model for calculating the equivalent thermal conductivity of porous silver is proposed, based on a voxelized mesh, using finite difference method (FDM) instead of the commonly used finite element method (FEM). Comparisons between the two methods are carried out for the classical unit cells such as simple cubic, body-centered cubic, and face-centered cubic, as well as the silver-based stochastic model. The developed finite difference algorithm is valid, and consistent results are obtained. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Equivalent thermal conductivity; Finite difference method; Porous media; Sintered silver; Voxelization","Electronics industry; Finite difference method; Heat conduction; Numerical methods; Silver; Sintering; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Thermal conductivity; Biomedical fields; Electronic industries; Equivalent thermal conductivities; Finite-difference methods; Porous medium; Porous silver; Power-electronics; Sintered silver; Third generation; Voxelization; Porous materials","","","","","Université Gustave Eiffel, UGE; , (Incentivo/SAU/LA0002/2013); ; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52205269); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52205269).

In previous studies, the reduction of the residual stresses and the optimization of the microstructure have been treated separately. Nevertheless, the ability to control both them at the same time is mandatory for improving the final quality of AM parts. This is the main goal of this paper. Thus, a thermo-mechanical finite element model is firstly calibrated by simulating a multi-track 40-layer Ti–6Al–4V block fabricated by directed energy deposition (DED). Next, the numerical tool is used to study the effect of the baseplate dimensions and the energy density on both residual stresses and microstructure evolution. On the one hand, the results indicate that the large baseplate causes higher residual stresses but produces more uniform microstructures, and contrariwise for the smaller baseplate. On the other hand, increasing the energy density favors stress relief, but its effect fails to prevent the stress concentration at the built basement. Based on these results, two approaches are proposed to control both the stress accumulation and the metallurgical evolution during the DED processes: (i) the use of a forced cooling suitable for small baseplates and, (ii) the adoption of grooves when large baseplates are used. The numerical predictions demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed manufacturing strategies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Additive manufacturing; Microstructure control; Processing optimization; Residual stress reduction; Thermo-mechanical simulation","3D printers; Additives; Deposition; Microstructure; Quality control; Stress relief; Base plates; Deposition process; Directed energy; Energy density; Energy depositions; Microstructural inhomogeneity; Microstructure control; Processing optimizations; Residual stress reductions; Thermomechanical simulation; Residual stresses","","","","","China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201906290011); China Scholarship Council, CSC; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (872570); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFB1100100); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2016YFB1100100), the European KYKLOS 4.0 project: An Advanced Circular and Agile Manufacturing Ecosystem based on rapid reconfigurable manufacturing process and individualized consumer preferences (no. 872570), and the China Scholarship Council (no. 201906290011).","Gu D., Shi X., Poprawe R., Bourell D., Setchi R., Zhu J., Material-structure-performance integrated laser-metal additive manufacturing, Science, (2021); Baiges J., Chiumenti M., Moreira C.A., Cervera M., Codina R., An adaptive finite element strategy for the numerical simulation of additive manufacturing processes, Addit Manuf, 37, (2021); Xue A., Lin X., Wang L., Lu X., Ding H., Huang W., Heat-affected coarsening of β grain in titanium alloy during laser directed energy deposition, Scripta Mater, 205, (2021); Lu X., Chiumenti M., Cervera M., Tan H., Lin X., Wang S., Warpage analysis and control of thin-walled structures manufactured by laser powder bed fusion, Metals, 11, 5, (2021); Zhao Z., Chen J., Lu X., Tan H., Lin X., Huang W., Formation mechanism of the α variant and its influence on the tensile properties of laser solid formed Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy, Mater Sci Eng A, 691, pp. 16-24, (2017); Chiumenti M., Neiva E., Salsi E., Cervera M., Badia S., Moya J., Chen Z., Lee C., Davies C., Numerical modelling and experimental validation in selective laser melting, Addit Manuf, 18, pp. 171-185, (2017); Lu X., Lin X., Chiumenti M., Cervera M., Li J., Ma L., Wei L., Hu Y., Huang W., Finite element analysis and experimental validation of the thermomechanical behavior in laser solid forming of Ti-6Al-4V, Addit Manuf, 21, pp. 30-40, (2018); Cao Y., Lin X., Kang N., Ma L., Wei L., Zheng M., Yu J., Peng D., Huang W., A novel high-efficient finite element analysis method of powder bed fusion additive manufacturing, Addit Manuf, (2021); Lu X., Chiumenti M., Cervera M., Li J., Lin X., Ma L., Zhang G., Liang E., Substrate design to minimize residual stresses in directed energy deposition AM processes, Mater Des, 202, (2021); Chiumenti M., Lin X., Cervera M., Lei W., Zheng Y., Huang W., Numerical simulation and experimental calibration of additive manufacturing by blown powder technology.

Herein, the feasibility of tailoring the microstructure and mechanical properties of Inconel 625 alloy to improve material properties and help achieve part quality consistency by controlling IHT in directed energy deposition (DED) is demonstrated. In this study, thermal monitoring was used to obtain thermal histories of as-built specimens to reveal the differences in thermal characteristics under different IHT. The results show that the variation of IHT has an important effect on the primary dendrite arm spacing (PDAS), the temperature and cooling rate of the molten pool, the morphology and content of Laves, and can initiate unusual δ precipitation in the interdendritic region which may be related to the dissolution of Laves. And this time-position-dependent IHT effect results in a hardness fluctuation of about 23.6 % in the bottom and top of the as-built specimen with a dwell time of 1 s, while the hardness is relatively uniform in the specimen with a dwell time of 10 s. Furthermore, by simulating the IHT variation process, its effect on precipitate and hardness was further confirmed. © 2022 The Authors","Directed energy deposition; Hardness; Inconel 625; Intrinsic heat treatment; Microstructure","3D printers; Additives; Deposition; Heat treatment; Microstructure; Morphology; Directed energy; Directed energy deposition; Dwell time; Energy depositions; Heat input; Inconel 625; Inconel 625 alloys; Intrinsic heat treatment; Laser additive manufacturing; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Hardness","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51722502, U20A20295); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U20A20295, 51722502).

The basis for independent mobility is a functional locomotor system. The hip joint can be so badly damaged by everyday wear or accelerated by illness that reconstruction by means of endoprostheses is necessary. Results: In order to ensure a high quality of life for the patient after this procedure as well as a long service life of the prosthesis, a high-quality design is required, so that many different aspects have to be taken into account when developing prostheses. Long-term medical studies show that the service life and operational safety of a hip prosthesis by best possible adaptation of the stiffness to that of the bone can be increased. The use of additive manufacturing processes enables to specifically change the stiffness of implant structures. Conclusions: Reduced implant stiffness leads to an increase in stress in the surrounding bone and thus to a reduction in bone resorption. Numerical methods are used to demonstrate this fact in the hip implant developed. The safety of use is nevertheless ensured by evaluating and taking into account the stresses that occur for critical load cases. These results are a promising basis to enable longer service life of prostheses in the future. © 2022, The Author(s).","Hip implant; Selective laser melting; Structural optimization","Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Hip Joint; Hip Prosthesis; Humans; Prosthesis Design; Quality of Life; 3D printers; Additives; Hip prostheses; Musculoskeletal system; Numerical methods; Stiffness; Additive manufacturing process; Endoprostheses; Hip implants; Hip joints; Life expectancies; Long service life; Quality of life; Selective laser melting; Stiffness optimizations; Structural optimisations; adaptation; adult; Article; bone stress; controlled study; device safety; experimental test; human; male; middle aged; osteolysis; prosthesis design; quality of life; rigidity; selective laser melting; hip; hip prosthesis; hip replacement; prosthesis design; Structural optimization","","","","","Universität Paderborn","","Schmitt-Sody M., Pilger V., Gerdesmeyer L., Rehabilitation und Sport nach Hüfttotalendoprothese, Orthopade, 40, pp. 513-519, (2011); Wirtz D.C., AE-Manual der Endoprothetik—Knie, (2011); Health at a glance 2019: OECD indicators, (2019); Kirschner P., Hüftendoprothetik, Chirurg, 76, pp. 95-104, (2005); Reimeringer M., Nuno N., The influence of contact ratio and its location on the primary stability of cementless total hip arthroplasty: a finite element analysis, J Biomech, 49, pp. 1064-1070, (2016); Derar H., Shahinpoor M., Recent patents and designs on hip replacement prostheses, Open Biomed Eng J, 9, pp. 92-102, (2015); Bieger R., Ignatius A., Decking R., Claes L., Primary stability and strain distribution of cementless hip stems as a function of implant design, Clin Biomech, 27, pp. 158-164, (2012); Murr L., Martinez E., Gaytan S., Medina F., Next generation orthopaedic implants by additive manufacturing using electron beam melting, J Biomech, (2012); Arabnejad S., Johnston B., Tanzer M., Pasini D., Fully porous 3D printed titanium femoral stem to reduce stress-shielding following total hip arthroplasty, J Orthop Res, (2016); Gebhardt A., Kessler J., Thurn L., 3D-Drucken—Grundlagen und Anwendungen des Additive Manufacturing (AM), (2016); Wirtz T.P., Herstellung von Knochenimplantaten aus Titanwerkstoffen durch Laserformen.

Non-destructive evaluation methods are used extensively to understand the defects and the microstructure of 3D printed composite parts. Considerable intellectual property is involved in designing and manufacturing composite parts, which needs to be protected using innovative methods. One of the concerns in this area is counterfeit parts made on high quality 3D printers, which need to be identified. This study aims to investigate and provide a part-authentication methodology for 3D printed composite parts by using the micro-computed tomography (μCT) scans of discontinuous fiber-reinforced polymer composite (FRPC) parts. The microstructure of FRPC contains fibers, matrix and porosity that are unique to the specimen and is a result of the printing parameters. Specimen A is printed with an infill direction of 90∘ and wall count of 3 and specimen B has the same infill direction but does not contain a wall boundary. A comparison between the different μCT datasets of the specimens can identify the distinguishing features of the 3D printed composite part. The correlation developed across different μCT datasets from extracted features and the metrics formulated can be used to quantitatively differentiate the composite specimens. Frequency domain analysis shows the most promising results by correctly identifying 3 out of the 6 datasets belonging to the same AM. A part identification and authentication method for AM composites will be useful for identifying genuine or counterfeit parts and protect intellectual property. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Fiber-reinforced polymers; Micro-computed tomography; Part authentication","","","","","","","","Wong K.V., Hernandez A., A review of additive manufacturing, Int.

To detect such alterations in the human blood flow pattern, diagnostic devices must provide an appropriately high spatial resolution. Shifted position-diffuse reflectance imaging (SP-DRI) has the potential to do so; it is an all-optical diagnostic technique. So far, SP-DRI has mainly been developed using Monte Carlo simulations. The present study is therefore validating this algorithm experimentally on realistic optical phantoms with thread structures down to 10 μm in diameter; a SP-DRI sensor prototype was developed and realized by means of additive manufacturing. SP-DRI turned out to be functional within this experimental framework. The position of the structures within the optical phantoms become clearly visible using SP-DRI, and the structure thickness is reflected as modulation in the SP-DRI signal amplitude; this performed well for a shift along the x axis as well as along the y axis. Moreover, SP-DRI successfully masked the pronounced influence of the illumination cone on the data. The algorithm showed significantly superior to a mere raw data inspection.

While green total factor productivity (GTFP), an effective evaluation index of green production, involves both economic and environmental factors, which corresponds to the political and market-driven nature of ETS. This study investigated whether ETS policy could affect industrial GTFP and how it works. First, based on panel data of 278 cities from 2003 to 2017, this article first introduces industrial GTFP calculated by the SBM-GML model and EBM-GML model separately. Second, this study realizes that the implementation of ETS policy has significant and positive effects on industrial GTFP by establishing a difference-in-differences model. Third, this study reveals that the implementation of ETS policy may increase the industrial GTFP by affecting the amount of industrial labor, industrial added value, CO2 emission, and industrial wastewater discharge. Fourth, by constructing a TFP index, this study shows that the implementation of ETS policy has no significant impact on the production efficiency of industrial enterprises. Finally, there is regional heterogeneity when studying the effect of ETS policy on industrial GTFP. © 2022 by the authors.","difference-in-differences method; emission trading scheme; epsilon-based measure model; global Malmquist–Luenberger index; green total factor productivity; slacks-based measure model","China; carbon emission; economic development; emissions trading; total factor productivity","","","","","Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST; Tohoku University; UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (104872); Autonomous Decentralized Cooperative DC Microgrids, (JPMJOP1852)","This research was supported by the JST (Japan Science and Technology Agency) OPERA Program \u201CCreation of R-EIC Converged Network Infrastructure based on Overall Optimization of Autonomous Decentralized Cooperative DC Microgrids\u201D (JPMJOP1852) and Doctoral Fellowship from Tohoku University.","Jiang J., Ye B., Xie D., Tang J., Provincial-level carbon emission drivers and emission reduction strategies in China: Combining multi-layer lmdi decomposition with hierarchical clustering, J.

As a natural application, topology optimization has been involved in the structural design of HXs aiming at improving heat exchange performance (HXP) and meanwhile controlling pressure drop (PD). In this paper, a novel multiphysics-based topology optimization framework is developed to maximize the HXP for 2D cross-flow HXs, and concurrently limit the PD between the fluid inlet and outlet. In particular, an isogeometric analysis solver is developed to solve the coupled steady-state Navier–Stokes and heat convection–diffusion equations. Non-body-fitted control mesh is adopted instead of dynamically remeshing the design domain during the evolution of the boundary interface. The method of moving morphable voids is employed to represent and track boundary interface between the hot and the remaining regions. In addition, various constraints are incorporated to guarantee manufacturability of the optimized structures with respect to practical considerations in additive manufacturing, such as removing sharp corners, controlling channel perimeters, and minimizing overhangs. To implement the iterative optimization process, the method of moving asymptotes is employed. Numerical examples show that the HXP of the optimized structure is greatly improved compared with its corresponding initial design, and the PD between the fluid inlet and outlet is controlled concurrently. Moreover, a smooth boundary interface between the channel and the cold fluid, and improved manufacturability are simultaneously obtained for the optimized structures. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Cross-flow heat exchanger; Heat exchange performance; Isogeometric analysis; Manufacturability improvement; Pressure drop; Topology optimization","Diffusion in liquids; Drops; Energy conservation; Equations of state; Heat convection; Heat exchangers; Iterative methods; Navier Stokes equations; Shape optimization; Structural design; Topology; Cross-flow heat exchangers; Energy-savings; Heat exchange performance; Isogeometric analysis; Manufacturability; Manufacturability improvement; Optimization framework; Optimized structures; Performance; Topology optimisation; Pressure drop","","","","","Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center; National Science Foundation, NSF, (ACI-1928147, ACI-1548562, ACI-1928147); Army Research Laboratory, ARL, (W911NF-20-2-0175)","The research in this paper was sponsored by the Army Research Laboratory and was accomplished under Cooperative Agreement Number W911NF-20-2-0175.

In this work, the 2209 duplex stainless steel (DSS) was WAAMed using cold metal transfer (CMT) method. The anisotropy of WAAMed 2209DSS was systematically discussed based on the characterization of microstructure and mechanical properties. The results showed that the prior ferrite had a strong anisotropy. The 〈100〉 crystal direction had a preferential orientation in building direction (BD). The 〈110〉 crystal direction had a preferential orientation in welding direction (WD) and transverse direction (TD). The austenite had a K–S relationship on the orientation with ferrite. The tensile samples were machined in three crystal direction of prior ferrite, including <100> in BD, <110> in WD, and 〈111〉. The tensile sample in 〈111〉 showed the largest ultimate tensile strength (UTS). According to the variation of Schmid factors, the ferrite in <111> had the smallest Schmid factor in {110}〈111〉 slipping system. It yielded a larger stress for dislocation movement and contributed to the largest UTS. The tensile sample in <100> achieved the largest elongation as the larger Schmid factor of ferrite in {110}<111 > slipping system and austenite in {111}〈110〉 slipping system. In addition, the centrosymmetry of orientation around the axis of tensile sample in <100> weakened the stress concentration and helped a more uniform elongating. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Anisotropy; Duplex stainless steel; Plasticity; Strength","3D printers; Additives; Anisotropy; Austenite; Crystal orientation; Plasticity; Tensile strength; Cold metal transfers; Crystal direction; In-buildings; Manufacturing IS; Metal parts; Preferential orientation; Schmid factors; Strength; Ultimate tensile strength; Welding directions; Ferrite","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (BK20210756); Postdoctoral Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (2021K035A)","This work was financially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province ( BK20210756 ) and Postdoctoral Foundation of Jiangsu Province ( 2021K035A ).","Li B., Liang W., Wang B., Li D., Oliveira J.P., Cui R., Yu J., Luo L., Chen R., Su Y., Guo J., Fu H., Electron beam freeform fabrication of NiTi shape memory alloys: Crystallography, martensitic transformation, and functional response, Mater.

In the literature, many electrochemical platforms have been produced using additive manufacturing with great variations in how the AME itself is described. It is seen that when measuring the near-ideal outer-sphere redox probe hexaamineruthenium (III) chloride (RuHex), decreasing the AME connection length enhances the heterogeneous electrochemical transfer (HET) rate constant ((Formula presented.)) for the system. At slow scan rates, there is a clear change in the peak-to-peak separation (ΔEp) observed in the RuHex voltammograms, with the ΔEp shifting from 118 ± 5 mV to 291 ± 27 mV for the 10 and 100 mm electrodes, respectively. For the electroanalytical determination of dopamine, no significant difference is noticed at low concentrations between 10- and 100-mm connection length AMEs. However, at concentrations of 1 mM dopamine, the peak oxidation is shifted to significantly higher potentials as the AME connection length is increased, with a shift of 150 mV measured. It is recommended that in future work, all AME dimensions, not just the working electrode head size, is reported along with the resistance measured through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to allow for appropriate comparisons with other reports in the literature. To produce the best additively manufactured electrochemical systems in the future, researchers should endeavor to use the shortest AME connection lengths that are viable for their designs. © 2022 by the authors.","3D-printing; additive manufacturing; electroanalysis; electrochemistry; electrodes","Dopamine; Electrodes; Oxidation-Reduction; Additives; Amines; Chlorine compounds; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Neurophysiology; Rate constants; Ruthenium compounds; dopamine; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Dopamine; Electroanalyse; Electroanalytical performance; Electrochemical performance; Electrochemical platforms; Electrochemicals; Electrode connections; Redox probe; electrode; oxidation reduction reaction; 3D printers","","dopamine, 51-61-6, 62-31-7; Dopamine, ","","","","","Ryan K.R., Down M.P., Banks C.E., Future of additive manufacturing: Overview of 4D and 3D printed smart and advanced materials and their applications, Chem.

In this research, a comprehensive investigation of the sustainable production mechanisms of tungsten heavy alloys was presented through recognizing the surface morphologies, subsurface microstructures, as well as micro-tool wear features, supported by the critical outcomes from single laser scanning (SLS) and laser-assisted micro-milling (LAMM) experimental tests. A laser thermal affected zone, which is composed mainly of surface oxide layer, near-surface softening layer, and subsurface metamorphic layer, was produced in laser heating. The relationship model between surface energy density and the thickness of laser thermal affected zone was determined. On this basis, a microstructure-based selection approach of the LAMM conditions, such as laser power and the depth of cut, was adopted to achieve a high-performance surface. Results indicated that a nanometer-level roughness surface, Sa = 57.03 nm, with no apparent residual thermal affected layer and newly generated subsurface damage layer were identified while suppressing flank wear. It is confirmed that the adaptability between the thickness of laser thermal affected layer and the depth of cut impacts LAMM sustainable production and justifies its application prospect. © 2022","Laser-assisted micro-milling; Microstructural transformation; Single laser scanning; Surface and subsurface characteristics; Tungsten heavy alloys","Cutting tools; Iron alloys; Laser applications; Micromachining; Microstructure; Nickel alloys; Sustainable development; Tungsten alloys; Wear of materials; Laser assisted micro millings; Laser scanning; Laser thermal; Laser-assisted; Micro machining; Microstructural transformations; Single laser scanning; Single lasers; Surface and subsurface characteristics; Tungsten heavy alloys; Milling (machining)","","","","","Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program, (2021YJ0547); Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program","The authors thank Dr. John Zhang (Chengdu MRJ-Laser Technology Co., Ltd) for their assistance with SLS experiment.

To this date, there is no study that characterizes Ti6Al4V lattice structure microscopic geometrical parameters based on mechano-regulatory theories. This research compared twenty-four different lattice topologies using bone ingrowth stimulations, at ten different relative densities (between 5 % and 50 %) subjected to four different pressures (0.5 MPa, 1 MPa, 1.5 MPa and 2 MPa). A total of 964 results from the numerical mechano-regulation analysis are presented. Sub-groups of Stretching-dominated lattice (SDL) and Bending-dominated lattice (BDL) topologies were compared. The analyzed topologies include AFCC, Auxetic, BCC, Diamond, FBCC, FCC, G7/ Octahedron, Kelvin cell, Vintile, Rhombic Dodecahedron, Cubic, Octet, Cuboctahedron, Rhombicuboctahedron, Iso-truss, Truncated Cube, Truncated Cuboctahedron, and BCCZ, FCCZ, FBCCXYZ and Cubic Center. Higher deformation and fluid flow were observed in BDL topologies leading to better mature bone growth stimulation compared to the SDL topologies. Topologies with lower Young's Moduli were also leading to better growth stimulation. It is found that the most favourable BDL topologies include, BCC, Diamond, FBCC, G7, Octahedron. On the other hand, the most favourable SDL are Tetrahedron and Tesseract. Material selection design charts are created which will help in the design of novel Ti6Al4V lattice-based implants. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Lattices; Mechano-biology; Orthopaedic implant; Osseointegration; Ti6Al4V","3D printers; Aluminum alloys; Bone; Elastic moduli; Flow of fluids; Geometry; Lattice theory; Ternary alloys; Vanadium alloys; Cellular solids; Cuboctahedra; Growth stimulation; Lattice; Lattice topology; Lattice-based; Mechano-biology; Mechano-regulation; Orthopaedic implants; Osseointegration; Titanium alloys","","","","","; Canadian Network for Research and Innovation in Machining Technology, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, CANRIMT, NSERC","The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Mostafa S.A ElSayed reports financial support was provided by Canadian Network for Research and Innovation in Machining Technology, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

New techniques are presented to explore this situation that is depending on expressing the stress tensor as an expansion in the velocity gradients for particularly values of the power-index α(α=0,0.5,1,2). Due the importance of the dynamic viscosity in Ellis's case, the viscous dissipation impacts are not neglected and a stagnation-point is taken place in the flow area. At the wedge surface, the Newtonian heating and passively controlling of the nanoparticles are considered. The transformed governing equations are solved using the Finite Difference Method (FDM) with Blottner algorithm and the obtained results are validated by applying Runge-Kutta method. The main outcomes disclosed that for all values of α, the growing in the material parameter A gives a great enhancement in values of RexCfx. Additionally, the increase in the unsteadiness parameter A1 enhances the forced convection process and hence (NnxRex1/2), RexCfx and (NuxRex1/2) have higher values.  © 2022 The Authors.","Activation energy; Ellis nanofluids; FDM-Blottner; MHD; Newtonian heating","Activation energy; Magnetohydrodynamics; Nanofluidics; Reynolds number; Rhenium compounds; Runge Kutta methods; Viscous flow; Ellis nanofluid; Finite difference method-blottne; Finite-difference methods; Nanofluid flow; Nanofluids; Newtonian heating; Oxytactic microorganisms; Time dependent; Viscous dissipation; Wedge flow; Finite difference method","","","","","Deanship of Scientific Research, King Faisal University, DSR, KFU, (R.G.P2/22/43); Deanship of Scientific Research, King Faisal University, DSR, KFU","The authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University for funding this work through Large Groups Project under grant number ( R.G.P2/22/43 ).","Muhammad K., Hayat T., Alsaedi A., Ahmad B., Momani S., Mixed convective slip flow of hybrid nanofluid (mwcnts+ cu+ water), nanofluid (mwcnts+ water) and base fluid (water): A comparative investigation, J.

The goal of this article is to describe and analyze how to develop a strength-based optimization to design the topology and infill microstructures density by minimizing the failure load subjected to weight constraint. To establish the coated structure, the material and coating indicators are obtained using double smoothing and projection of design variable. Additionally, three characteristic parameters are utilized to represent the lattice geometry. Two lattices, including octet-truss lattice and cubic lattice, are considered for the infill region. The strength-based optimization is developed based on Hill's yield criterion, and the element failure indices are aggregated to a single function using the p-mean approach. The proposed design methodology has been successfully applied to different numerical test cases, which showed that performing strength-based optimization led to a smoother boundary at the re-entrant corner and achieving a lower failure load. Numerical evaluation also demonstrated that, in contrast to solely considering characteristic parameters to design lattice, considering additional material and coating indicators during the design process resulted in optimized topology as well as infill microstructures material distribution. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Coated structures; Homogenization; Stress optimization; Topology optimization","3D printers; Additives; Infill drilling; Microstructure; Shape optimization; Strength of materials; Structural optimization; Topology; Characteristics parameters; Coated structure; Failure load; Homogenization; Optimisations; Strength optimization; Stress optimization; Three-dimensional stiffness; Three-dimensional strength; Topology optimisation; Coatings","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1847133)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the National Science Foundation (NSF) under award number 1847133 with program manager, Dr. Kathryn Jablokow.","Clausen A., Aage N., Sigmund O., Topology optimization of coated structures and material interface problems, Comput.

The different colors and mechanical properties for teeth and the gum base mean a complete denture is manufactured using two materials with different mechanical properties. This study proposes a method to make a complete denture using a laboratory-developed, multiresin additive manufacturing (MRAM) system with two resins and different mechanical properties. A tenon joint is used to create the bottom of the teeth that fit into the gum base, ensuring automatic alignment and higher bending strength. The mechanical properties, material waste, fabrication time, and effect of the tenon joint on the bending strength of a complete denture printed using the MRAM system are compared with the values for a computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) system. Experimental results show that the printed denture is manufactured 3 times faster and produces 14 times less material waste, but is 35.08% less inaccurate than one produced using a CAD/CAM system. The proposed tenon joint increases the bending strength by 31.94%. The MRAM system is applicable for printing a complete denture.

Components fabricated by the inappropriate manufacturing parameters will be too unreliable to satisfy the strict requirements of industrial applications. To address these issues, the present study established an experiment with a coaxial high-speed charge coupled device (CCD) camera to monitor the 316L deposition process and developed a data-driven model with ResNet101 to identify different melt pool states. We adopted the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding clustering algorithm, accuracy rate, and normalized confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of ResNet101. Furthermore, the visualization technique class activation mapping was used to analyze the morphological characteristics of the melt pool formed under different experimental parameters, explained the classification behavior of the ResNet101 model. The result indicated that ResNet101 gains better feature extraction and higher capability to classify different melt pool states with an average accuracy of 99.07%, compared with other CNNs (LeNet, GoogLeNet, AlexNet, ResNet34, and ResNet50) models. This demonstrated the effectiveness of ResNet101 in monitoring the DED process and the potential to reduce fabrication costs in DED. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.","additive manufacturing; deep learning; directed energy deposition","Additives; Charge coupled devices; Clustering algorithms; Deep learning; Deposition; Stochastic systems; Critical challenges; Deep learning; Deposition process; Directed energy; Directed energy deposition; Energy depositions; Formation qualities; Manufacturing IS; Melt pool; Suit monitoring; 3D printers","","","","","2020 Li Ka Shing Foundation Cross-Disciplinary Research, (2020LKSFG01D); Innovation Team Project of Guangdong Provincial University, (2020KCXTD012); Key Project of Guangdong Provincial University, (2019KZDXM046); Shantou University, STU, (NTF19030); Shantou University, STU; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51875075, 52175455); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2021A1515011989); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation, China (Grant Nos. 51875075, 52175455), Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China (Grant No. 2021A1515011989), Innovation Team Project of Guangdong Provincial University, China (Grant No. 2020KCXTD012), Key Project of Guangdong Provincial University, China (Grant No. 2019KZDXM046), Shantou University Research Startup Funding Project (Grant No. NTF19030) and the 2020 Li Ka Shing Foundation Cross-Disciplinary Research (Grant No. 2020LKSFG01D).

The case of AlSi10Mg (large globularized Si-rich particles surrounded by an α-Al phase) processed by additive manufacturing and post-treated is taken as a typical example. Grids of nano-indentation tests are performed at different locations on the nanocomposite using a Berkovich indenter and show an impact of the hard inclusions on the experimental curves. The elastoplastic properties of the matrix are identified based on the lowest load–indentation depth curves. Several representative finite element (FE) models demonstrate the influence of the particles on the nano-indentation response. The capacity of the FE model to predict the indentation curve of a cube corner indenter experiment and the Berkovich grid result scattering was checked. A representative volume element (RVE) based on a scanning electron microscope (SEM) image is defined. The identified material parameters of the α-Al phase and Si phase, it allows the prediction of the stress-strain curve of a macroscopic experimental tensile test. © 2022","AlSi10Mg; Finite element simulation; Metal matrix composites (MMC); Nano-indentation","Finite element method; Indentation; Metallic matrix composites; Scanning electron microscopy; Silicon; Stress-strain curves; Al phase; Finite element modelling (FEM); Finite elements simulation; Hard inclusions; Inclusion material; matrix; Matrix composite; Metal matrix; Metal matrix composite; Nano indentation; Tensile testing","","","","","Aude Simar's UCL; Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS, FNRS, (2.5020.11, DIE19-0005)","Funding text 1: This research was conducted within LongLifeAM project of WALInnov program - Convention 1810016 Région Wallonne.

Transforming a 3D problem into the relevant two-dimensional (2D) problems using the dimension splitting method (DSM) is the main idea of FIM method. The improved interpolating moving least-squares (IIMLS) method is applied in 2D problems to obtain required approximation function with interpolation property. Finite difference method (FDM) is utilized in time domain and the direction of splitting. Take the improved element-free Galerkin (IEFG) method as a comparison, difficulties created by the singularity of weight functions, such as truncation error and calculation inconvenience, are overcome by the FIM method. And it can directly implement the Dirichlet boundary conditions. To prove the advantages of the new method, three examples are selected and solved by the FIM method. Comparing and analyzing the calculation results, it can be shown that the FIM method effectively improves computation speed and precision. © 2022","Fast interpolating meshless method; Finite difference method;

We apply nonlinear statistical models to estimate the functions that appear in the physics of Black Holes of the axion–dilaton system in four dimensions. These statistical models include parametric polynomial regression, nonparametric kernel regression and semi-parametric local polynomial regression models.

The process and fabrication systems restrict the part geometry producible, which must be taken into account during design already. For this reason, a design process was investigated in which geometry generation is based on a self-organizing system. The aim of using a self-organizing system is the possibility to directly control the geometry-defining points. Next to load cases, the design method considers geometric boundary conditions from the production process when generating the geometry. In order to identify these geometrical constraints from production experimentally, a concept of Case Study Demonstrators was applied. This was used to investigate how path planning and production can be carried out for specific geometrical features and to identify restraints of the process and the manufacturing system, e.g., smallest producible wall thickness and overhangs. Subsequently, the obtained restraints were considered as boundary conditions for the design process and were included in the modification of an example geometry. By applying the presented design method, it was possible to maintain a minimum wall thickness throughout the structure while generating a topologically optimized geometry. In contrast to compliance with the minimum wall thickness, no satisfactory behavioral rule could be found for limiting the overhang. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; computational design; construction; digital fabrication; direct energy deposition; metal additive manufacturing; steel structures","","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (414265976—TRR 277)","The research presented in this paper is being conducted within the project “Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) of Complex and Refined Steel Components (A07)”.

This study focused on the influences of the circular beam oscillation on the microstructure characteristics, tensile properties, and electrochemical corrosion performances of Inconel 625 alloy. The stirring effect of the circular beam oscillation on the molten pool interrupts the formed dendrites, and the partially fractured grains acted as nuclei to promote the growth of equiaxed grains. The average grain size of circular oscillation decreased from 111.51 to 66.49 μm. The cooling rate of the molten pool of the circular oscillation was faster, and the Refractory elements were captured by the γ matrix before Laves phase was formed, thus reducing the Laves phase content in the coating with circular beam oscillation by 50.66 %. The finer grains and lower Laves phase content reduced the crack source, and the ultimate tensile strength and yield strength of circular beam oscillation were increased by 56.95 % and 128 % respectively. The lower grain size of circular beam oscillation leads to the increase of corrosion spots, resulting in the decrease of corrosion current density by 62.3 %, which weakens the corrosion resistance. © 2022","Beam oscillation;

In this study, day ahead scheduling problem in SG is adopted by using DSM strategy in SG considering different types of consumers to reduce operational cost and pollution emission, load curtailment cost by considering curtailable loads (CLs), and coordination between shiftable loads (SLs) and wind turbines (WTs) output power. The consumers participating in the DSM strategy are responsive consumers, which can shift and curtail loads, and non-responsive consumers who cannot shift or curtail loads. The DERs used in the proposed day-ahead scheduling problem consists of wind energy source (WES), energy storage systems (ESSs), and diesel generators (DGs). Before integrating wind energy sources with SG, its forecasting is necessary; thus, the probability distribution function (PDF) is used to forecast wind speed. The day-ahead scheduling problem with tri objective function is solved using the multi-objective wind driven optimization (MOWDO) technique using the decision-making mechanism (DMM) to obtain the best solution in search space. Simulation results show that the day ahead scheduling multi-objective problem is solved using MOWDO algorithm. To check the effectiveness of the proposed model, it is applied to SG considering different constraints to receive balance power at the user end. © 2022 Karabuk University","Consumer price; Day-ahead scheduling; Demand-side management; Multi-objective optimization; Multi-objective wind driven; Optimization algorithm; Smart grid; Wind power","","","","","","Taif University, TU, (TURSP-2020/331); Taif University, TU","The authors would like to acknowledge the support from Taif University Researchers Supporting Project Number(TURSP-2020/331), Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia.","Sarker E., Halder P., Seyedmahmoudian M., Jamei E., Horan B., Mekhilef S., Stojcevski A., Progress on the demand side management in smart grid and optimization approaches, Int.

To develop reliable solutions for soft robotics applications, devices with the ability to deform and change shape are required, which must be equipped with appropriate sensors capable of withstanding large deformations at suitable speeds and respond repeatedly. This work presents a methodology to build strain sensors made of sensitive, thin, and conductive channels printed inside a soft matrix, using three-dimensional printing. As proof of concept, rectangular beams and semispherical caps embedded with sensitive circuits are developed that are designed to deform under applied forces and detect the gradual contact with objects. The rectangular beam with conductive lines separated from the neutral plane exhibits a quasi-linear electrical response as a function of the applied shear strain. Mechanical diodes, which trigger an activated response once a given deformation onset is exceeded, are implemented using circumferential conductive channels that are centered with the spherical body sensor. Sinusoidally shaped conductive channels located at a given distance from the spherical surface produce a monotonic electrical response, which detects deformations over a broad range. Linear sensors, with enhanced sensitivity to compression, are created if the sensitive conductive channels are oriented along the compression direction. Numerical calculations, used to guide the design of the sensor, show the capability of these sensors to measure simultaneous normal and tangential forces, making them suitable for applications involving fragile object manipulation and robot locomotion. An example of application of these sensors in the control of the forces applied by soft gripper lifting an object is given.

In this paper, we propose a modular microfluidic system using projection micro-stereolithography three-dimensional (3D) printing technology for droplet generation. All modules are designed using a standard cubic structure with a specific leakage-free connection interface. Versatile droplets, including single droplets, alternating droplets, merged droplets, and Janus particles, have been successfully produced. The droplet size and the generation rate can be flexibly controlled by adjusting the flow rates. The influence of the flow rate fraction between the discrete phase and the continuous phase over the generation of the alternating and merged droplets is discussed. Furthermore, the ‘UV curing’ module can be employed to solidify the generated droplets to avoid coalescence and fix the status of the Janus particles. The proposed modular droplet generators are promising candidates for various chemical and biological applications, such as single-cell incubation, screening of protein crystallization conditions, synthesis of nanoparticles, and gene delivery. In addition, we envision that more functional modules, e.g., valve, microreactor, and detection modules, could be developed, and the 3D standardized modular microfluidics could be further applied to other complex systems, i.e., concentration gradient generators and clinical diagnostic systems. © 2022 by the authors.","droplet generation; modular microfluidics; standardized microfluidics","Microfluidic Analytical Techniques; Microfluidics; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Single-Cell Analysis; 3D printing; Biosynthesis; Curing; Drops; Fluidic devices; Gene transfer; Particle size analysis; Droplet generation; Droplet-based microfluidics; Janus particles; Materials synthesis; Microfluidics systems; Modular microfluidic; Modulars; Projection micro-stereolithography; Single cells analysis; Standardized microfluidic; Article; crystallization; gene delivery system; gene targeting; microfluidic analysis; nonhuman; nucleic acid analysis; proteomics; single cell analysis; stereolithography; three dimensional printing; wettability; microfluidics; procedures; three dimensional printing; Microfluidics","","","","","National Special Fund for the Development, (2020YFF01014503); Shanghai Rising-Star Program, (20QA1407000)","This research was funded by the National Special Fund for the Development of Major Research Equipment and Instrument, grant number 2020YFF01014503, and Shanghai Rising-Star Program, grant number 20QA1407000.","Ayuso J.M., Virumbrales-Munoz M., Lang J.M., Beebe D.J., A role for microfluidic systems in precision medicine, Nat.

Extensive literature review complemented with experts' advice utilized systematically helped in the identification of 12 critical factors for the effective adoption of color-jet printing technology. A hierarchical structural model is developed using interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and analyzed using Matriced Impacts Croise's Multiplication Appliquée a UN Classement (MICMAC). Identified software and the machine cost are primary drivers for this color-jet 3D printing machines (technology). The value of this technology is to provide the product at a lower cost and give useful applications in the area of medical, engineering and concept building. There is a need for developing better quality core material and post-processing material, further supported by enabling machine hardware and software. Accuracy and color texture of the part produced are essential to provide a technological advantage over existing technologies. Post-processing assists in a big way in imparting necessary properties to the part produced. Presently, the infiltrate/post-processing materials are limited, and for large-scale acceptability, one needs extensive multidisciplinary research and development. This research provides a structural model toward the adoption of color-jet 3D printing technology, which can also help users in evaluating this technology in broader AM framework.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Co.","3D printing; additive manufacturing (AM); color-jet-printing (CJP); critical success factors (CSF); interpretive structural modeling (ISM)","Additives; Color; Coremaking; Cost engineering; Engineering education; Textures; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Additive manufacturing; Color jets; Color-jet-printing; Critical success factor; Interpretive structural modeling; Interpretive structural models; Jet printing; Success factors; 3D printers","","","","","","","Agarwal A, Shankar R, Tiwari MK, Modelling the metrics of lean, agile and leagile supply chain: An ANP-based approach, European Journal of Operational Research, 173, 1, pp. 211-225, (2006); Agarwala M, Bourell D, Beaman J, Marcus H, Barlow J, Post-processing of selective laser sintered metal parts, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 1, 2, pp. 36-44, (1995); Aroca RV, Ventura CEH, Mello ID, Pazelli TFPAT, Sequential additive manufacturing: Automatic manipulation of 3D printed parts, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 23, 4, pp. 653-659, (2017); Baechler C, DeVuono M, Pearce JM, Distributed recycling of waste polymer into RepRap feedstock, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 19, 2, pp. 118-125, (2013); Baldinger M, Levy G, Sch€onsleben P, Wand°uh M, Additive manufacturing cost estimation for buy scenarios, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 22, 6, pp. 871-877, (2016); Banga HK, Belokar RM, Kalra P, Kumar R, Fabrication and stress analysis of ankle-foot orthosis with additive manufacturing, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 24, 2, pp. 301-312, (2018); Bass L, Meisel NA, Williams CB, Exploring variability of orientation and ageing e® ects in material properties of multi-material jetting parts, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 22, 5, pp. 826-834, (2016); Bastola AK, Paudel M, Li L, Development of hybrid magnetorheological elastomers by 3D printing, Polymer, 149, pp. 213-228, (2018); Begines B, Hook AL, Alexander MR, Tuck CJ, Wildman RD, Development, printability and post-curing studies of formulations of materials resistant to microbial attachment for use in inkjet-based 3D printing, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 22, 5, pp. 835-841, (2016); Bingham GA, Hague R, E±cient three-dimensional modelling of additive manufactured textiles, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 19, 4, pp. 269-281, (2013); Borille A, Je® erson G, Rudolf M, Karl G, Applying decision methods to select rapid prototyping technologies, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 16, 1, pp. 50-62, (2010); Bosque C, What are you printing?

Three-dimensional food printing has benefits for providing personalized health and shape fabrication for consumers. Past studies have demonstrated positive consumer perceptions for 3D food printing, but there is still a need for consumer validation of the technology through consumption and rating of fabricated 3D-printed foods. This article measures consumer response on shape, taste, and fidelity for 3D-printed food designs. Participants (N = 28) were presented with a series of designs differing in shape complexity and ingredients (marzipan and chocolate) and provided ratings using a visual analog scale (100 mm line). The results show that fabricated shapes with higher complexity were preferred by participants with 8.8 ± 0.3 ratings over lower complexity shapes with 5.5 ± 0.4 ratings. Taste preference was primarily dependent on the material selection, with chocolate material preferred by participants with 8.2 ± 0.5 ratings over marzipan material with 6.0 ± 0.5. Results demonstrated that participants preferred 3D-printed shapes that achieved high fidelity in recreating their computer-aided design (CAD) with 7.3 ± 0.3 ratings that were greater than 5.5 ± 0.5 for low-fidelity prints. These findings demonstrate first measurements of 3D food printing from a consumer perspective and provide a foundation for future studies on personalized manufacturing and nutrition.

The coarse powder is a byproduct of pre-alloyed powder produced for selective laser and electron beam additive manufacturing. The TMC process involves powder compaction, fast sintering, in-situ dehydrogenation and an immediate hot extrusion to form a fully dense and fine-grained martensitic microstructure. Further dehydrogenation in vaccum at 700 °C converted the martensitic microstructure into an interwoven α/β microstructure which exhibited an improved yield strength, apparent necking and premature cracking at grain boundary α (αGB) ribbons. A further annealing of 880 °C/1 h/AC led to the formation of a fine-grained α/βt composite structure, which achieved an enhance ultimate tensile strength of 835 MPa and excellent tensile ductility of 16.0%. Analysis of the deformation behavior of the alloy in different states revealed that the α/βt composite structures brought about an enhanced strain hardening capability by heterogeneous deformation effect of hard βt and soft α-laths, which inhibited the formation of microcracks and consequently improved the coordinated deformation. © 2022","Coarse pre-alloyed powder; Deformation behaviour; Hydrogenation; Near α-Ti alloy; Tensile properties","Deformation; Grain boundaries; Hydrogen storage; Hydrogenation; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Pore structure; Powder metallurgy; Sintering; Strain hardening; Structure (composition); Tensile strength; Titanium alloys; Coarse pre-alloyed powder; Deformation behavior; Extra low interstitial; Fine grained; Martensitic microstructure; Near α-ti alloy; Prealloyed powder; Tensile deformation; Thermo-mechanical; Ti alloys; Dehydrogenation","","","","","Xing Liao Talent Plan” of Liaoning Province, (XLYC1802080); Northeastern University, NEU; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (02080022117003); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","Funding text 1: This work was financially supported by the “Xing Liao Talent Plan” of Liaoning Province, China (No. XLYC1802080) and the Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities (No. 02080022117003).

It has the added benefit of accepting input material that is readily formed from swarf. The present work addresses questions that have arisen over the impact of the process on the precipitation in 6063 aluminium alloys (AA6063). The mechanical properties and microstructure throughout the deposit was assessed and characterized in T4, T5 and T6 conditions using a combination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). In the as-deposited condition, the degree of precipitation was highly heterogeneous across the different printed layers, resulting in a significant hardness gradient from the bottom to the top of the deposit. Such gradients in hardness and precipitation could be eliminated through the use of a T6 heat treatment. Additionally, the EBSD result shows that the deposited AA6063 exhibited a relatively refined and equiaxed grain structure, which evolved via continuous dynamic recrystallization during deposition. These results emulate those observed for 6xxx-series alloy deposits formed from primary material. This work demonstrates the capacity of AFSD as a viable method of solid state Al recycling, creating depositions with wrought-like properties when an adequate post-deposition heat treatment is conducted. © 2022","Additive friction stir deposition; Aluminium; Microstructure evolution; Recycling; Solid-state additive manufacturing","","","","","","","","Green J.A.S., Aluminum recycling and processing for energy conservation and sustainability, ASM Int., (2007); Mahinroosta M., Allahverdi A., Hazardous aluminum dross characterization and recycling strategies: a critical review, J.

Recently, SystemC-based Virtual Prototypes (VPs) have been introduced into the RISC-V ecosystem to lay the foundation for advanced industry-proven system-level use-cases. However, VP-driven environment modeling and interaction have mostly been neglected in the RISC-V context. In this paper, we propose such an extension to broaden the application domain for virtual prototyping in the RISC-V context. As a foundation, we built upon the open source RISC-V VP available at GitHub. For a visualization of the environment purposes, we designed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and designed appropriate libraries to offer hardware communication interfaces such as GPIO and SPI from the VP to an interactive environment model. Our approach is designed to be integrated with SystemC-based VPs that leverage a Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM) communication system to prefer a speed-optimized simulation. To show the practicability of an environment model, we provide a set of building blocks such as buttons, LEDs and an OLED display and configured them in two demonstration environments. Moreover, for rapid prototyping purposes, we provide a modeling layer that leverages the dynamic Lua scripting language to design components and integrate them with the VP-based simulation. Our evaluation with two different case-studies demonstrates the applicability of our approach in building virtual environments effectively and correctly when matching the real physical systems. To advance the RISC-V community and stimulate further research, we provide our extended VP platform with the environment configuration and visualization toolbox, as well as both case-studies as open source on GitHub. © 2022 by the authors.","embedded systems; RISC-V; simulation; SW/HW co-design; SystemC; TLM; virtual prototyping","","","","","","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (01IW22002, 16ME0127)","This work was supported in part by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the projects ECXL under contract No. 01IW22002 and Scale4Edge under contract No. 16ME0127.","Waterman A., Asanovic K., The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual; Volume I: Unprivileged ISA, (2019); Waterman A., Asanovic K., The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual; Volume II: Privileged Architecture, (2021); De Schutter T., Better Software.

In this work, a finite element simulation of the directed energy deposition (DED) process is used to predict the space- and time-dependent temperature field during the multi-layer build process for Inconel 718 walls. The thermal model results show good agreement with dynamic infrared images captured in situ during the DED builds. The relationship between predicted cooling rate, microstructural features, and mechanical properties is examined, and cooling rate alone is found to be insufficient in giving quantitative property predictions. Because machine learning offers an efficient way to identify important features from series data, we apply a 1D convolutional neural network data-driven framework to automatically extract the dominant predictive features from simulated temperature history. Very good predictions of material properties, especially ultimate tensile strength, are obtained using simulated thermal history data. To further interpret the convolutional neural network predictions, we visualize the extracted features produced on each convolutional layer and compare the convolutional neural network detected features of thermal histories for high and low ultimate tensile strength cases. A key result is the determination that thermal histories in both high and moderate temperature regimes affect material properties. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Additives; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Cooling; Infrared imaging; Machine learning; Multilayer neural networks; Temperature; Tensile strength; Convolutional neural network; Cooling rates; Data-driven analysis; Directed energy; Energy depositions; Inconel-718; Process structures; Structures and properties; Thermal history; Ultimate tensile strength; Forecasting","","","","","W.

The delivered particles interact with the melt flow in different regions of melt pool, and the interactions between the liquid melt pool and the spherical particles are different from those between the melt pool and irregular particles. The objective of this investigation is to reveal the mechanisms and dynamics of pore formation unique to spherical-powder delivery in the laser DED AM process. In situ high-speed and high-resolution X-ray imaging showed that delivered spherical particles could induce pore formation mechanisms through the interactions between the melt pool and the particle front surface, the particle side surface, or the particle back surface. These results indicate that spherical particles induce different pore formation mechanisms from irregular particles. This fundamental understanding will benefit further investigations into reducing porosity and improving DED-fabricated part quality. © 2022 The Authors","Directed energy deposition; Porosity; Spherical powder; X-ray imaging","","","","","","","","Gu D., Shi X., Poprawe R., Bourell D.L., Setchi R., Zhu J., Material-structure-performance integrated laser-metal additive manufacturing, Science, 372, 6545, (2021); Thompson M.K., Moroni G., Vaneker T., Fadel G., Campbell R.I., Gibson I., Martina F., Design for additive manufacturing: trends, opportunities, considerations, and constraints, CIRP Ann., 65, 2, pp. 737-760, (2016); Bhardwaj T., Shukla M., Paul C.P., Bindra K.S., Direct energy deposition-laser additive manufacturing of titanium-molybdenum alloy: parametric studies, microstructure and mechanical properties, J.

The integration of carbon fibres, with good electrical and thermal conductivity, within an insulating polylactic acid (PLA) matrix produces a conductive functional material. These properties allow to manufacture mesoscopic electrothermal actuators and more complex monolithic structures including them. A compact and monolithic 3D printable positioning system with built-in V-shaped actuators is proposed in this paper. The prototype presented has an 86.2mm 3 workspace for a particularly compact footprint, i.e. 206mm × 109mm × 21mm. In this system, the linear motions along the X and Y axes are decoupled from the linear motion along Z, which is also decoupled from the rotation θ around Z, thus simplifying future kinematic control strategies. Multi-physics coupling analyses are performed in ANSYS to validate the estimated performance of each component of the positioning system. Then, experimental characterisations based on 3D printed prototypes were carried out and showed good agreement between models and experiments. These first results also include the implementation of a first closed loop control strategy using a Smith predictor. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Additive manufacturing; Compliant mechanism; Electrothermal actuators; Mechanism analysis; Mechanism design","Additives; Compliant mechanisms; Electric heating; Functional materials; Machine design; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Composites material; Conductive Polymer; Electro-thermal actuators; Linear motion; Mechanism analysis; Mechanism design; Positioning system; Technological advances; 3D printing","","","","","Labex CAMI; , (ANR-11-LABX-0004)","This work was supported by the Investissements d\u2019Avenir (Labex CAMI ANR-11-LABX-0004).","Teo T.J., Yang G., Chen I.-M., Compliant Manipulators, pp. 1-64, (2014); Zhang H., Wu Z., Xu Q., Design of a New XY Flexure Micropositioning Stage With a Large Hollow Platform, Actuators, 9, 3, (2020); Hussein H., Tahhan A., Moal P.L., Bourbon G., Haddab Y., Lutz P., Dynamic electro-thermo-mechanical modelling of a U-shaped electrothermal actuator, J Micromech Microeng, 26, 2, (2016); Potekhina A., Wang C., Review of Electrothermal Actuators and Applications, (2019); Zhang Z., Yu Y., Liu X., Zhang X., Dynamic modelling and analysis of V- and Z-shaped electrothermal microactuators, Microsyst Technol, 23, 8, pp. 3775-3789, (2017); Moulton T., Ananthasuresh G.K., Micromechanical Devices With Embedded Electro-Thermal-Compliant Actuation, Sens.

Transdermal drug delivery (TDD) has attracted strong interest from researchers, as it allows minimally invasive and painless insulin administration, showing advantages over conventional delivery methods. Systems composed of microneedles (MNs) assembled in a transdermal patch provide a unique route of administration, which is innovative with promising results. This paper presents the design of a transdermal patch composed of 25 microneedles manufactured with 3D printing by stereolithography with a class 1 biocompatible resin and a printing angle of 0°. Finite element analysis with ANSYS software is used to obtain the mechanical behavior of the microneedle (MN). The values obtained through the analysis were: a Von Misses stress of 18.057 MPa, a maximum deformation of (Formula presented.), and a safety factor of 4. Following this, through a flow simulation, we find that a pressure of 1.084 Pa and a fluid velocity of 4.800 (Formula presented.) were necessary to ensure a volumetric flow magnitude of (Formula presented.). Furthermore, the parameters found in this work are of great importance for the future implementation of a transdermal drug delivery device. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing; finite element analysis; microneedles; transdermal drug delivery","3D printers; Biocompatibility; Controlled drug delivery; Insulin; Needles; Safety factor; Targeted drug delivery; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Diabetes mellitus; Endocrine disorders; Finite element analyse; Glucose metabolism; Microneedles; Minimally invasive; Transdermal drug delivery; Transdermal patches; Finite element method","","","","","","","Aldawood F.K., Andar A., Desai S., A Comprehensive Review of Microneedles: Types, Materials, Processes, Characterizations and Applications, Polymers, 13, (2021); Baishalina J.A., Ashish D.W., Microneedle–Future prospect for efficient drug delivery in diabetes management, Indian J.

The axially-loaded behaviors are critical for structural safety and durability in engineering fields. In order to extend the application of IWP structures into civil engineering, this paper investigated the axially-loaded behaviors, including compressive strength, force distribution, load-deflection pattern, energy absorption and cracking pattern, of the main and secondary Skeletal-IWP structures. Firstly, a novel method for simplifying triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMSs) has been put forward. Then the main and secondary Skeletal-IWP units are fabricated using stereolithography technology and tested. The discrete element method (DEM) is adopted, for the first time, to simulate the axially-loaded behaviors of IWP structures with different unit cell arrangements after the validation by robust experimental results. The results reveal that the secondary Skeletal-IWP structures outperform the main Skeletal-IWP structures in compressive strength. When the unit arrangement changes from single unit to 7 × 7 × 7, the compressive strength of the main and secondary Skeletal-IWP structures increases from 9 MPa to 13.4 MPa and 9.2 MPa to 14.4 MPa, respectively. The main type shows a “X”-shaped cracking pattern, and the secondary shows a “X”-shaped cracking pattern. © 2022","Compressive strength; Cracking; Discrete element method (DEM); Energy absorption; Triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS)","Compressive strength; Cracks; Energy absorption; Musculoskeletal system; Cellular structure; Cracking patterns; Damping ratio; Discrete element method; Discrete elements method; Mechanical damping; Package structure; Structural safety; Triply periodic minimal surface; Triply periodic minimal surfaces; Finite difference method","","","","","European Commission for H2020-MSCA-RISE; China Scholarship Council, CSC; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (691135); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020","The paper was partially funded by the China Scholarship Council.

The composite materials are characterized well and unveiled an exceptional specific capacitance of 1982 F g−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Furthermore, the fabricated symmetric supercapacitor displayed excellent specific capacitance of 662 F g−1, with a specific energy of 29.4 Wh kg−1 at 1 A g−1. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the developed system is attributed to its good surface-to-volume ratio achieved by the incorporation of the surfactant and the homogeneous morphology of the composite in favor of the strong pseudocapacitance of doped PANI. The synergy between the faradaic and nonfaradaic counterparts maintained a capacitance retention of 80.2 % for the fabricated SSC after 5000 CD cycles and a coulumbic efficiency of 98.9 %. The results demonstrate that the surfactant incorporated hybrid composite is an ideal candidate for supercapacitor applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Electrochemical supercapacitors; Hybrid composite; Surfactant; Symmetric supercapacitor","Aniline; Capacitance; Graphene; Hybrid composites; Morphology; Polyaniline; Surface active agents; Electrochemical supercapacitor; Energy storage applications; Hybrid composites; One pot; Oxidative polymerization of aniline; Performance; Specific capacitance; Symmetric supercapacitor; Symmetrics; Ternary hybrid; Supercapacitor","","","","","University of Kerala; Structural Timber Innovation Company, STIC","Funding text 1: For analytical support, the authors acknowledge the Centralized Common Instrumentation Facility (CCIF), Government College for Women, Thiruvananthapuram, CLIF, University of Kerala, STIC, Cochin.

The combined Cartesian/curvilinear printing head motion is accomplished by attaching a biomimetic, flexible, “tendon cable” soft robot arm to a conventional Cartesian three axis 3D printing carousel. This allows printing along a combination of Cartesian and curvilinear coordinates using five independent stepper motors controlled by an Arduino Uno with each motor requiring a microstep driver powered via a 12 V power supply. Three of the independent motors control the printing head motion along conventional Cartesian coordinates while two of the independent motors control the length of each pair of the four “tendon cables” which in turn controls the radius of curvature and the angle displacement of the soft printer head along two orthogonal planes. This combination imparts motion along six independent degrees-of-freedom in Cartesian and curvilinear coordinates. The design of the system is described together with experimental results, which demonstrate that this design can print continuously along curved and inclined surfaces while avoiding the “staircase” effect, which is typical of conventional three axis 3D printing along curvilinear surfaces.

However, it suffers from resource sub-utilization due to the traffic heterogeneity in time and bandwidth domains, and the crosstalk between the adjacent cores in a multi-core fiber link. In this paper, we propose time and bandwidth aware traffic balancing strategies with crosstalk consideration to efficiently utilize the spectral resources in MCF based EONs. To this end, we utilize network features and SLA conditions to balance the traffic, in both, the time and the bandwidth domains. In bandwidth domain, we utilize squeezing and splitting with multipath routing, and in time domain, we use sliding and shifting. To further enhance the performance, we use a MCF structure dependent prioritized core allocation based RMCSA strategy. Simulation results indicate superiority of the proposed strategies in terms of different parameters of interest as compared to the benchmark strategies. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Bandwidth squeezing; Crosstalk; Multi-core fiber based elastic optical networks (MCF based EONs); Multipath routing; Routing and spectrum allocation; Scheduled traffic; Service level agreement; Traffic balancing","Bandwidth; Fiber optic networks; Space division multiple access; Bandwidth squeezing; Core fibre; Elastic optical networks; Multi-core fiber based elastic optical network; Multi-cores; Multi-paths routing; Routing and spectrum allocation; Routings; Scheduled traffics; Servicelevel agreement (SLA); Spectrum allocation; Traffic balancing; Crosstalk","","","","","","","(2018); Winzer P.J., Spatial multiplexing: the next frontier in network capacity scaling, pp. 1-4, (2013); Saridis G.M., Alexandropoulos D., Zervas G., Simeonidou D., Survey and evaluation of space division multiplexing: from technologies to optical networks, IEEE Commun.

The iro3d is a powder deposition machine designed to build metal parts. This research work proposed the adaptation of the iro3d selective powder deposition process to allow the production of glass-ceramic parts using recycled glass powders. Various specimens were produced using different deposition strategies such as build orientation and sintering holding times. Specimens were evaluated in terms of geometric distortions (shrinking and warping) and in terms of mechanical performance (flexural behavior and hardness). Two geometrically complex test parts were also produced to infer the minimum feature size capabilities of the process. The results denoted parts that displayed significant geometrical deviations, which could be correlated with some of the tested parameters. Through the addition of sand to the tested specimens, we demonstrated that distortions could be mitigated with proper control of the powder’s coalescence. In the end, the specimens’ fracture surfaces were examined, and the presence of porosities was correlated with their mechanical properties. The results demonstrated that the iro3d SPD process could be used to produce additively manufactured glass parts. © 2022 by the authors.","build orientation; iro3d; sand; shrinkage; sintering","","","","","","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (PTDC/EME-EME/4593/2021, UIDB/50022/2020)","Funding text 1: The authors thank Blasqem, Lda, and Coniex S.A. for kindly providing the glass micro-spheres and Strobel Quarzsand GmbH for kindly providing their sand.

For rapid fabrication and evaluation of the kinesin-MT based devices, optical control techniques have been developed for control of kinesin activity and density; however, use of caged molecules lacks spatial controllability for long-term experiments, and direct irradiations of UV light onto kinesin-coated surfaces are inherently damaging to MTs due to their depth limit since the heights of the kinesin-MT systems are at the tens of a nanometer scale. Considering surface electric fields in electrolytic solutions are shielded at the nanometer scale due to Debye shielding, in this study, we show that fine spatial control of kinesin density and activity is enabled using surface-limited electrochemical reactions induced by indirect irradiations of an electron beam (EB). An EB is indirectly irradiated onto the kinesins through a 100-nm-thick silicon nitride membrane, and the electrons scattered in the membrane can cause localized electrochemical effects to the kinesins. We show that these localized electrochemical effects cause both ablation of kinesins and motility control of kinesin activity by changing the EB acceleration voltage. In particular, the latter is achieved without complete ablation of MTs, though the MTs are indirectly irradiated by the EB. As a demonstration of on-demand control of gliding MTs, we show the accumulation of the MTs on a target area by scanning the EB. The proposed accumulation technique will lead to rapid prototyping of microdevices based on MT-kinesin motility assay systems.  © 2022 Author(s).","","Ablation; Electric fields; Irradiation; Silicon nitride; Surface reactions; Electrochemical effects; Electron-beam; Kinesins; Lab-on-a-chip devices; Localised; Microtubules; Motility assays; Nano-meter-scale; Spatial control; Surface limited reactions; Electron beams","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (19H02100, 15J09841, 15H05511)","The authors would like to thank Mr. Kai Uemura for supporting the analysis of the experimental data.

In this study, we propose a new multilayer quantum dot (QD) superlattice (SL) structure with graphene as the core and silicon (Si) as the shell of QD. The Slater–Koster tight-binding method based on Bloch theory is exploited to investigate the band structure and energy states of the graphene/Si QD. Results reveal that the graphene/Si QD is a type-I QD and the ground state is 0.6 eV above the valance band. The results also suggest that the graphene/Si QD can be potentially used to create a sub-bandgap in all Si-based intermediate-band solar cells (IBSC). The energy level hybridization in a SL of graphene/Si QDs is investigated and it is observed that the mini-band formation is under the influence of inter-dot spacing among QDs. To evaluate the impact of the graphene/Si QD SL on the performance of Si-based solar cells, we design an IBSC based on the graphene/Si QD (QDIBSC) and calculate its short-circuit current density (Jsc) and carrier generation rate (G) using the 2D finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. In comparison with the standard Si-based solar cell which records Jsc = 16.9067 mA/cm2 and G = 1.48943 × 1028 m−3⋅s−1, the graphene/Si QD IBSC with 2 layers of QDs presents Jsc = 36.4193 mA/cm2 and G = 7.94192 × 1028 m−3⋅s−1, offering considerable improvement. Finally, the effects of the number of QD layers (L) and the height of QD (H) on the performance of the graphene/Si QD IBSC are discussed.

Such parameters determine geometric stability, favorable microstructures, and good mechanical properties. This study aimed to investigate the effects of pulsed laser parameters (duty cycle and pulse frequency) and scanning patterns (unidirectional and bidirectional patterns) on the properties of parts fabricated using LMD. Results show that the properties of the LMD-fabricated parts are obviously influenced by pulsed laser parameters and scanning patterns. Using the unidirectional scanning pattern in both pulsed laser parameters enhances the properties of the thin-walled parts prepared using LMD. An increase in duty cycle can improve geometric stability, increase grain size, and reduce microhardness. Furthermore, the geometric stability does not vary considerably with the use of different frequencies, but the microstructure of fabricated parts shows various grain sizes with different pulse frequencies. In addition, the microhardness increases as the frequency increases from 13.33 to 50 Hz. In general, the influence of the duty cycle on geometric properties is greater than that of frequency. Meanwhile, the impact of frequency on microhardness is greater than that of the duty cycle. © 2022, The Author(s).","Geometric properties; Grain size; Hardness; Laser metal deposition (LMD); Pulse laser; Scanning pattern","Fabrication; Geometry; Grain size and shape; Microhardness; Microstructure; Scanning; Thin walled structures; Duty-cycle; Geometric properties; Geometric stability; Grainsize; Laser metal deposition; Laser parameters; Property; Pulse laser; Scanning pattern; Pulsed lasers","","","","","Foundation of Equipment Pre-research Area, (80923010401); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52175455); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (DUT20JC19); Dalian Science and Technology Innovation Fund, (2020JJ26GX040)","This research work was supported partially by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52175455), Equipment Pre-research Foundation (No. 80923010401), Science and Technology Innovation Fund of Dalian (No.2020JJ26GX040), and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. DUT20JC19).

These techniques allow for the digitization of full three-dimensional (3D) surfaces and provide time-domain surface information data with high details not previously possible with more traditional measurement techniques. A variety of industries are using these technologies with a focus on high accuracy industrial applications including aerospace and automotive. This paper introduces optical measurements techniques used to provide quantifiable data and visual information of a woman's abdomen during various stages of pregnancy. Two non-invasive techniques are used for this study including structured light (SL) scanning and digital image correlation (DIC). An overview of these techniques, the process for data collection, results of the data, and opportunities for future studies are presented in this paper. The structured light scanning was used to capture a 3D surface of the woman's abdomen at four to six week intervals starting at week 15 of maternity and ending six days prior to birth. The results quantify growth during each stage of pregnancy along with full surface data in addition to postnatal results. The DIC data was collected during week 30 when the baby was very active in the womb and external deformations on the woman's abdomen were observed visually. The results from these studies were not intended to be a formal medical study but to provide feasibility of the SL and DIC process during the stages of pregnancy and encourage unique uses of otherwise industrial measurements. © 2022","Digital image correlation; Obstetrics; Optical measurement; Pregnancy; Structured light scanning","Data visualization; Image correlation; Optical correlation; Strain measurement; Time domain analysis; Camera sensor; Computer processing; Digital image correlations; Digitisation; Full three-dimensional; Optical measurement; Optical measurement techniques; Pregnancy; Structured light scanning; Three-dimensional (3D) surfaces; Obstetrics","","","","","Shape Fidelity; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA","Informed consent was obtained for experimentation with the woman to complete the scanning operations.

However, like other additive manufacturing processes, metal ME suffers from the problem of internal pores. In this study, warm isostatic pressure (WIP)—a post-process used to downsize or remove the pores in polymer ME—was employed in metal ME to improve the mechanical properties of the finished part. It was confirmed experimentally that the tensile strength and the strain at the ultimate tensile strength were increased by WIP. However, from hardness tests, two different results were obtained. On a microscopic scale, there was no change in hardness because the temperature of the WIP process was not high enough to change the microstructure, while on a macroscopic scale, the hardness changed owing to the collapse of the pores within the material under the indenter load. In specimens with relatively large pores, the hardness sensitivity increases with a larger indenter. Finally, factors affecting the WIP process parameters in metal ME were discussed. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; material extrusion; mechanical properties; metal filament; warm isostatic press","","","","","","Korea Institute of Industrial Technology, KITECH, (EO-20-0015); Korea Institute of Industrial Technology, KITECH","This study has been conducted with the support of the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology as “Development of root technology for multi-product flexible production (KITECH EO-20-0015)”.","Yadav D.K., Srivastava R., Dev S., Design & fabrication of ABS part by FDM for automobile application, Mater.

The feasibility of using ECM to machine an as-deposited Ti6Al4V alloy fabricated by the laser solid forming (LSF) method of AM was investigated in 15 wt% NaCl solution. As the machining current density increased, the material removal rate increased linearly, and the current efficiency dropped from 140% to 93%. The current efficiency over 100% at low current densities was attributed to the electrochemical reactions of atoms in lower valence states. The microdissolved grooves, resulting from selective preferential dissolution of the α phase, were shallowed when machined at a higher current density (>3 A cm−2) and are attributed to the weakening of the galvanic effect at higher machining voltages. Additionally, the dissolved surface topography exhibited the worst waviness at the delimited current density of 10 A cm−2, and the surface waviness decreased rapidly as the current density increased in the positive delimited range. Considering the machining efficiency and the surface quality of ECM, the as-deposited Ti6Al4V machined at a current density of 40 A cm−2 will be the preferred ECM current parameter. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Electrochemical dissolution; Machining efficiency; Surface quality; Titanium alloy","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Current density; Dissolution; Efficiency; Electric discharge machining; Electrochemical cutting; Sodium chloride; Surface properties; Ternary alloys; Topography; Advanced manufacturing technologies; Current efficiency; Electrochemical dissolution; Electrochemical machining; Machining efficiency; Manufacturing process; NaCl solution; New approaches; Ti-6Al-4V alloy; Titanium (alloys); Titanium alloys","","","","","Hong Kong Scholars Program, (XJ2021032); Natural Science Research Projects of General Universities in Jiangsu Province, (21KJB460019, 21KJB460025); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52105197, 52105387); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2021M692349)","The research was supported under the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 52105387 , 52105197 ), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2021M692349 ), Natural Science Research Projects of General Universities in Jiangsu Province (Nos. 21KJB460019 , 21KJB460025 ), and Hong Kong Scholars Program (No. XJ2021032 ).","Leyens C., Peters M., Titanium and Titanium Alloys: Fundamentals and Applications, (2003); Davydov A.D., Kabanova T.B., Volgin V.M., Electrochemical machining of titanium.

The effects of process parameters on deposition surface morphologies and geometrical characteristics were investigated. And a deposition width model was built by the multiple linear regressions. Based on the principle that the volume of the sample is equal to that of filler wire, a deposition height model was simultaneously derived. The results indicate that the disparity between two trends of droplet spreading in horizontal and molten pool tangential direction determines directly the final deposition geometrical characteristics. And two trends would be mainly affected by the heat input and arc force closely related to process parameters. The influences of three factors on the effective width percentage show a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. So, it provides an optimal process window for good deposition forming. The effective width percentage reaches 83% and the machining allowance is only 0.71 mm, which significantly improves material utilization and reduces manufacturing costs. Besides, the error rates of deposition width and height models are less than 4% and 6%, respectively. Two models can facilitate fabricating different size complex parts and make a profit for the actual production. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Aluminium alloy; Cold metal transfer pulse advance arc mode; Deposition geometrical characteristic; Dimension model; Wire arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Geometry; Wire; Arc mode; Cold metal transfer pulse advance arc mode; Cold metal transfers; Deposition geometrical characteristic; Dimension model; Effective width; Geometrical characteristics; Process parameters; Wire arc; Wire arc additive manufacturing; Deposition","","","","","National Key Laboratory for Remanufacturing, (6142005200401); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, NNSF, NSF, NSFC, (51775206); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, NNSF, NSF, NSFC","This research is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 51775206) and the foundation of the National Key Laboratory for Remanufacturing (No. 6142005200401).

The current work mainly investigates the heterogeneous and anisotropic behavior of the electron bean wire additive manufactured Ti-6Al-4 V. To investigate the effect of build orientation, cuboids were built to extract cylindrical samples with axis parallel to Z-axis, X-axis, Y-axis, and inclined at 45° to the base X-Y plane. Non-destructive inspection using radiography was conducted to ensure the attainment of defect-free samples. Further, the samples were subjected to advanced material characterization techniques. Microstructural features of as-built samples reveal the large columnar prior beta grains attributed to the rapid cooling in the vacuum chamber. Electron backscatter diffraction analysis shows β phase solidified as columnar grains. The martensite structure is observed in the Transmission electron microscopic analysis of the fabricated samples.

However, to fulfill the full potential of the process for structural applications, AFSD needs intense process optimization for a wide range of alloys with excellent mechanical properties. The present study explored AFSD of a novel metastable high entropy alloy (HEA), CS-HEA (Fe40Mn20Co20Cr15Si5 (at%)), enabled with transformation and twinning induced plasticity during deformation. Intense shear deformation at elevated temperature and strain rate during AFSD led to the operation of restoration mechanisms such as recovery, recrystallization, and grain growth which resulted in refined grains with excellent strength and work hardenability. The average grain size for as-deposited CS-HEA is 3.0 ± 0.5 µm, and the average tensile yield strength of as-deposited CS-HEA is 450 ± 20 MPa. The microstructural variation and mechanical response of the alloy as a function of process parameters were correlated to the AFSD process variables, phase transformation, and recrystallization kinetics. Further, the interaction between recrystallization kinetics and transformation kinetics on microstructural evolution of the material was explored. Additionally, the microstructure and stacking fault energy of the alloy were used to predict the mechanical response of the deposited material using a five parameter work hardening model. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive friction stir deposition; Dual phase recrystallization kinetics; High entropy alloys; Microstructural evolution; Transformation induced plasticity","3D printers; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Deposition; Entropy; Friction; Friction stir welding; Grain growth; High-entropy alloys; Iron alloys; Kinetics; Manganese alloys; Microstructural evolution; Optimization; Recrystallization (metallurgy); Silicon alloys; Strain hardening; Strain rate; Textures; Additive friction stir deposition; Dual phase; Dual phase recrystallization kinetic; Dual phasis; Friction stir; High entropy alloys; Mechanical response; Metastables; Recrystallization kinetics; Transformation induced plasticity; Additives","","","","","","","Gu D.D., Meiners W., Wissenbach K., Poprawe R., Laser additive manufacturing of metallic components: Materials, processes and mechanisms, Int.

First, the emissions and performance of a 4.5-liter 4-cylinder Cummins diesel engine are modeled using a DNN model with seven hidden layers and 24,148 learnable parameters created by stacking six Fully Connected layers with one long-short term memory (LSTM) layer. This model is then implemented as the plant model in an NMPC. For real-time implementation of the LSTM-NMPC, an open-source package acados with the quadratic programming solver HPIPM (High-Performance Interior-Point Method) is employed. This helps LSTM-NMPC run in real time with an average turnaround time of 62.3 milliseconds. For real-time controller prototyping, a dSPACE MicroAutoBox II rapid prototyping system is used. A Field-Programmable Gate Array is employed to calculate the in-cylinder pressure-based combustion metrics online in real time. The developed controller was tested for both step and smooth load reference changes, which showed accurate tracking performance while enforcing all input and output constraints. To assess the robustness of the controller to data outside the training region, the engine speed is varied from 1200 rpm to 1800 rpm. The experimental results illustrate accurate tracking and disturbance rejection for the out-of-training data region. At 5 bar indicated mean effective pressure and a speed of 1200 rpm, the comparison between the Cummins production controller and the proposed LSTM-NMPC showed a 7.9% fuel consumption reduction, while also decreasing both nitrogen oxides ((Formula presented.)) and Particle Matter (PM) by up to 18.9% and 40.8%. © 2022 by the authors.","deep learning; deep neural network; emission reduction; long-short-term memory; machine learning; model predictive control","Brain; Controllers; Deep neural networks; Diesel engines; Emission control; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Nitrogen oxides; Nonlinear systems; Open source software; Predictive control systems; Quadratic programming; Real time control; Accurate tracking; Deep learning; Emission reduction; Machine-learning; Model predictive controllers; Model-predictive control; Network-based; Non-linear modelling; Performance; Real- time; Model predictive control","","","","","; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; University of Alberta, UofA; Natural Sciences Research Council of Canada, (2016-04646)","The research was performed under the Natural Sciences Research Council of Canada Grant 2016-04646 and as part of the Research Group (Forschungsgruppe) FOR 2401 \u201COptimization based Multiscale Control for Low Temperature Combustion Engines,\u201D which is funded by the German Research Association (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG).

However, few studies focused on the radical inhibitors of photosensitive gels, which can remove free radicals produced in the non-printing condition and prevent the premature gelation of the photosensitive pre-hydrogel inks before printing. In this study, we designed natural polyphenols to be a kind of radical inhibitors. The polyphenol compounds including TA, PA, GA and HQ, showed good free radical scavenging ability. Especially, the TA as the radical inhibitor exhibits the excellent anti-polymerization effect due to the high density of catechol/pyrogallol groups and the dendritic structure. Additionally, by properly setting the concentration of polyphenols, the DLP-based 3D printing of photosensitive gels cannot be affected by the free radical scavenging performance of polyphenols. The polyphenols, as the radical inhibitor, can not only prevent the photosensitive gel ink from curing under natural illumination, but also ensure the success of 3D printing at specific wavelengths and intensity. Accordingly, the polyphenol compounds with radical scavenging properties will expand their potential applications as radical inhibitors in photocurable gel inks. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","DLP printing; Photosensitive gel; Polyphenol; Radical inhibitor","3D printers; Free radicals; Gelation; Light sensitive materials; Photosensitivity; Tissue engineering; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; DLP printing; Free radical scavenging; Photosensitive gel; Polyphenols; Printing materials; Radical inhibitor; Soft robotics; Tissues engineerings; Gels","","","","","Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Projects of Shanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, (YCX2019T06, YCX2020210, YGC2019TD10); Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province, (201901D111450); Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province; Agriculture Research System of China, (CARS-07-E-2); Agriculture Research System of China","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province (No. 201901D111450 ), the China Agriculture Research System (No. CARS-07-E-2 ); the Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Projects of Shanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences (Nos.

In this study, wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) was used to deposit a layer of new material on an existing surface, with the objective of finding the optimal configuration that maximized the layer quality and material efficiency. The parameters considered are the stepover among the deposited beads and the inclination of the torch with respect to the repaired surfaces. The inclination angle is crucial when repairing complex surfaces, like those of a mold, owing to accessibility issues, the torch cannot be maintained orthogonal to the surfaces along the entire toolpath. Different configurations were tested in order to assess the quality of the materials in terms of the presence of material voids, depth of penetration, and the heat affected zone (HAZ) and to understand the effects of these variables on the material efficiency and thickness of the repairing layer. It should be noted that by adopting deposition parameters set to have a low heat input, the use of a tilting angle has beneficial effects on the quality of the deposited layer and the process efficiency. Metallurgical and geometrical measurements were carried out to assess the effect of these two variables depositing a layer of plain carbon steel. © 2022, Shanghai University and Periodicals Agency of Shanghai University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Remanufacturing;

Austenitic stainless steels are commonly used among the numerous materials processed by WAAM and microstructural study of single walled components has been widely researched in the past. In this paper, manual cold metal transfer (CMT) welding is used to produce WAAM samples of SS308L austenitic stainless steel with SS304 as a substrate. Detailed microstructural studies with grain morphology of δ-ferrite based on heat input at various layers fabricated using WAAM-CMT are mainly explored. Results showed that the concentration of γ-austenite drops as heat input increases, but δ-ferrite and micro-inclusions increase. Within δ-ferrite, lathy ferrite morphology evolves into faceted morphology while vermicular evolves into a globular (spheroidized) ferrite morphology as heat input increases. The grain morphology pattern repeats itself for each layer as moving along the building direction, resulting in a repetitive heterogenous grain morphology with nearly identical chemical compositions. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Grain morphology; Microstructure; WAAM-CMT sample; γ-Austenite; δ-Ferrite","Austenite; Austenitic stainless steel; Fabrication; Morphology; Cold metal transfers; Ferrite grains; Ferrite morphologies; Grain morphologies; Heat input; Micro-structural; Wire arc; Wire-arc additive manufacturing-cold metal transfer sample; Γ-austenite; Δ-ferrite; Ferrite","","","","","","","Becker L., Rottger A., Boes J., Weber S., Theisen W., Processing of a newly developed nitrogen-alloyed ferritic-austenitic stainless steel by laser powder bed fusion – microstructure and properties, Additive Manuf., 46, (2021); Oliveira J.P., Santos T.G., Miranda R.M., Revisiting fundamental welding concepts to improve additive manufacturing: from theory to practice, Prog.

Although some thresholds on dimensions or orientation for 3D-printed simple bars or plates are available in the literature, a large number of variables that influence lattice 3D-printing require thorough investigation. In particular, numerous build orientation for inclined struts, heat dissipation in complex geometry, and structural joints are some unique features of lattices which should be considered while developing associated thresholds. Experimental observation indicated different sizes for similar struts at different locations on a lattice. This requires investigation on the influence of build orientation. In this study, a wide range of strut- and surface-based lattices were designed and fabricated from Ti-6Al-4V in order to study defects and dimensional accuracy. Manufacturability limitations and design considerations were evaluated to achieve a product that was representative of the original design in terms of both geometry and dimensional accuracy. It is demonstrated that below the identified thresholds, the orientation of the lattices on the build-plate influences the homogeneity and dimensional accuracy. Acceptable homogeneity in geometry was achieved for entire lattice structure after orienting 45° around two Cartesian axes. It is demonstrated that support structure should be enough large to facilitate heat dissipation and reduce thermal distortion. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Build orientation; Defect; Dimensional accuracy; Lattice; Manufacturability thresholds","3D printers; Geometry; Plates (structural components); Product design; Structural design; Struts; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Additive manufacturing process; Build orientation; Dimensional accuracy; Laser powders; Lattice; Lattice structures; Manufacturability; Manufacturability threshold; Powder bed; Solid modelling; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Army Research Lab Cooperative, (W911NF-18–2-0067)","Funding text 1: The authors appreciate the funding received from Army Research Lab Cooperative Agreement W911NF-18-2-0067 for enabling this work. ; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the funding received from Army Research Lab Cooperative Agreement W911NF-18–2-0067.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a non-invasive and popular tool to monitor cardiac health. ECG signal provides enormous information about the heart. ECG signals get contaminated with various kinds of noises. The presence of noises in the ECG signal may deceive cardiac health. A healthy heart may be diagnosed as unhealthy or suffering from arrhythmia. To get the appropriate information on cardiac health, noise removal from the ECG signal is essential. Method: This paper proposes a method based on the Fourier decomposition method (FDM) to suppress the commonly occurring noises such as power line interference, white Gaussian noise, baseline wander, muscle contraction, motion artifacts, and electromyographic noise in an ECG signal. The proposed method utilizes a discrete cosine transform (DCT) to process the ECG signal. The DCT coefficients corresponding to various noises are recognized and suppressed by FDM-based zero-phase filters. The proposed method is validated on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, noise stress test database, and real-time ECG data. Result: The performance of the method is evaluated in terms of the output signal-to-noise ratio, mean squared error, and percent root means square difference. The proposed method performs very well at a low input signal-to-noise ratio. With muscle contraction, motion artifact, and electromyographic noise, the proposed method provides an output signal-to-noise ratio of 27.42 dB, 29.39 dB, and 27.94 dB at a −10 dB input signal-to-noise ratio, respectively. Conclusion: Experimental results show that the proposed denoising method is superior to the existing techniques at a different level of the input signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, the fast Fourier transform to implement the proposed method offers low computational complexity and makes it suitable for real-time ECG signal processing. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Brazilian Society of Biomedical Engineering.","Baseline wander (BW);

Despite the many apparent advantages of AM, the instable heat transfer during the melting of metallic material and the stacking manufacturing processing increases the probability of generating internal defects that may cause the AM components to deform or fail. To ensure the quality and safety of additively manufactured metallic components, nondestructive testing technologies that are fast, accurate and low-cost are needed. In this paper we review the defect formation mechanism and the nondestructive testing methods for metallic AM components, and focus on the development of ultrasonic testing in AM. We analyze the influence of the manufacturing process, material microstructure and detection parameters on ultrasonic testing and summarize the application of ultrasonic testing for offline and online detection of defects in metallic AM components. On this basis, the application and advantages of phased array ultrasonic testing, laser-generated ultrasonic testing and hybrid nondestructive testing detection are discussed. The development trends of ultrasonic testing for metallic AM are discussed and some suggestions are made. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","laser-generated ultrasonic testing; metallic additive manufacturing; nondestructive testing; phased array ultrasonic testing; ultrasonic testing","Additives; Defects; Heat transfer; Industrial research; Nondestructive examination; Safety testing; Ultrasonic testing; Well testing; Laser-generated ultrasonic testing; Manufacturing components; Manufacturing IS; Manufacturing technologies; Metallic additive manufacturing; Metallic additives; Phased array ultrasonic testing; Phased-arrays; Testing technology; Ultrasonic non-destructive testing; 3D printing","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52075049); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2020JJ2028); Jiangsu Provincial Key Research and Development Program, (2022GK2058)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 52075049), the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (grant no. 2020JJ2028), and Hunan Provincial Key Research and Development Program (grant no. 2022GK2058).

Extrusion-based bioprinting of heterogeneous cell-laden hydrogels has shown promise in advancing rapid artificial tissue development. A major bottleneck limiting the rapid production of physiologically relevant tissue models is the current limitation in effectively printing large populations of cells. However, by significantly increasing hydrogel cell-seeding densities, the time required to produce tissues could be effectively reduced. Here, we explore the effects of increasing cell seeding densities on the viscoelastic properties, printability, and cell viability of two different alginate-gelatin hydrogel compositions. Rheological analysis of hydrogels of varying cell seeding densities reveals an inverse relationship between cell concentration and zero-shear viscosity. We also observe that as cell seeding densities increases, the storage moduli decrease, thus lowering the required printing pressures for gel extrusion. We also observe that increasing cell concentration can negatively impact the structural properties of the extruded material by increasing post-print line spreading. We find that hydrogels composed of higher molecular weight alginates and the highest cell-seeding densities (107 cells/mL) yield higher cell viability (>80%) and structural uniformity after printing. The optimized printing parameters determined for the alginate-gelatin bioinks explored may aid in the future rapid fabrication of functional tissue models for therapeutic screening. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3D Biofabrication; 3D Bioprinting; and Tissue microenvironment; Biomaterials; Hydrogel rheology","Alginates; Bioprinting; Gelatin; Hydrogels; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Rheology; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; Cells; Cytology; Diagnosis; Extrusion; Hydrogels; Physiological models; Tissue; Viscoelasticity; alginic acid; gelatin; hydrogel; alginic acid; hydrogel; 3d biofabrication; 3d bioprinting; And tissue microenvironment; Biofabrication; Bioprinting; Cell seeding density; Gelatin hydrogels; Hydrogel rheology; Microenvironments; Tissue models; Article; cell viability; controlled study; cross linking; flow kinetics; fluorescence; HEK293 cell line; human; human cell; molecular weight; oscillation; oscillometry; shear rate; shear stress; temperature; temperature sensitivity; three dimensional printing; tumor microenvironment; viscoelasticity; viscosity; Young modulus; bioprinting; chemistry; flow kinetics; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; Alginate","","alginic acid, 28961-37-7, 29894-36-8, 9005-32-7, 9005-38-3; gelatin, 9000-70-8; Alginates, ; Gelatin, ; Hydrogels, ","","","Grainger Foundation Frontiers of Engineering; NCI1U54CA233396, (1U54CA23344, 1U54CA23346); NSF FAMU CREST, (HDR-1735968); State of Florida; National Science Foundation, NSF, (CMMI-2000330, HDR-2000202); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Cancer Institute, NCI; National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS, (DMR-1644779, R16GM145595); National Academy of Sciences, NAS, (2000013181)","This work was funded by the National Science Foundation (No. HDR-2000202 and CMMI-2000330 ) and supported by the NSF FAMU CREST Center award (No. HDR-1735968 ).

However experimental trial and error to optimize deposit quality indexes, that rely on powder characteristics, can be costly and tedious. In this research, multiple finite element modelling approaches were compared regarding their capability and shortcomings to analyze the role of major powder features on deposit properties. Lagrangian and CEL methods were selected as the most robust approaches for analyzing the single/multi-particle impact condition, respectively. An intricate algorithm was introduced to accurately evaluate the effect of parameters including particle size, shape, oxidation extent, and impact angle on the deposition indicators such as critical velocity, particle flattening, and deposit porosity. The results exhibited a good agreement with the reported experimental data, confirming the capacity of the proposed numerical framework to tune the deposit properties as a function of a wide range of feedstock characteristics. It was concluded that for successful deposition, the effect of various powder properties and their respective effect and contribution towards plastic deformation should be taken into account. The results indicated that for a given particle velocity, smaller particle, more irregular morphology, thicker oxide layer, and smaller impact angle will result in limited particle deformation and a lower possibility of successful adhesion. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Coating; Finite element method; Powder; Supersonic deposition","3D printers; Additives; Coatings; Deposits; Feedstocks; Numerical methods; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Velocity control; Cold spray; Cold spray technology; Deposit quality; Experimental errors; Experimental trials; Impact angles; Property; Spray deposits; Supersonic deposition; Trial and error; Finite element method","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Horizon 2020, (101004172); Horizon 2020","Funding text 1: The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 101004172 (ATLAS, Advanced Design of High Entropy Alloys Based Materials for Space Propulsion).; Funding text 2: The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 101004172 (ATLAS, Advanced Design of High Entropy Alloys Based Materials for Space Propulsion).","Papyrin A., Kosarev V., Klinkov S., Alkhimov A., Fomin V.M., (2007); Assadi H., Gartner F., Stoltenhoff T., Kreye H., Bonding mechanism in cold gas spraying, Acta Mater., 51, pp. 4379-4394, (2003); Bagherifard S., Guagliano M., Fatigue performance of cold spray deposits: Coating, repair and additive manufacturing cases, Int.

Strong anisotropy can be induced during the extrusion process owing to the preferentially orientated fiber reinforced plastics with high aspect ratio. To make better use of AM-induced material anisotropy, an integrated material-structure-performance design strategy for AM-produced carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) structures was proposed, in which the microscopic material and mesoscopic structural anisotropies were integrated to achieve enhanced macroscopic mechanical performance of CFRP core structures and sandwich sheets. The effects of AM process parameters including the layer thickness and build orientation on microscopic material anisotropy of the AM produced CFRP were firstly investigated and the strong relationship between material anisotropy and AM process parameters was confirmed by extensive mechanical tests and microscopic observations. A new core structure possessing the arbitrary bending anisotropy was proposed and the relationship between structural anisotropy ratio and bending stiffness was clarified. In addition, the mechanical properties of core structures were tested and superior mechanical performance can be achieved by tailoring the combination of material and structural anisotropies. The effects of structural anisotropies on mechanical properties and face buckling behaviors of sandwich sheets were investigated and found that face buckling is the dominant failure behavior. The new finding that the integration of microscopic material anisotropy and mesoscopic structural anisotropy induced by AM could enhance the mechanical property and formability of CFRP core sandwich sheets is of great significance in the design of lightweight structures. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Anisotropy; Chopped fiber reinforced plastics; Forming; Structural design","Additives; Anisotropy; Aspect ratio; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Elastomers; Extrusion; Fibers; Structural design; Structural properties; Additive manufacturing process; Carbon-fibre reinforced plastics; Chopped fiber reinforced plastic; Core structure; Lightweight structures; Material anisotropy; Mechanical performance; Mesoscopics; Sandwich sheets; Structural anisotropy; 3D printers","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (20H00300, JP 21J11337)","This work was financially supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) (Contract No. 20H00300 ) and JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP 21J11337 .","Allum J., Moetazedian A., Gleadall A., Silberschmidt V.V., Interlayer bonding has bulk-material strength in extrusion additive manufacturing: New understanding of anisotropy, Addit.

However, the current technology still exhibits a limitation in realizing the selective deposition and sorting of various materials contained in the same reservoir, which can contribute significantly to additive printing or manufacturing by enabling simultaneous sorting and deposition of different substances through a single nozzle. Here, we propose a dielectrophoresis (DEP)-based material-selective deposition and sorting technique using a pipette-based quartz tuning fork (QTF)-atomic force microscope (AFM) platform DEPQA and demonstrate multi-material sorting through a single nozzle in ambient conditions. We used Au and silica nanoparticles for sorting and obtained 95% accuracy for spatial separation, which confirmed the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). To validate the scheme, we also performed a simulation for the system and found qualitative agreement with the experimental results. The method that combines DEP, pipette-based AFM, and SERS may widely expand the unique capabilities of 3D printing and nano-micro patterning for multi-material patterning, materials sorting, and diverse advanced applications.

Additive manufacturing techniques such as laser directed energy deposition (laser DED) can fabricate multi-material structures (MMS) in a near single step. Many components fabricated via laser DED require post-processing operations such as heat treatment and this is challenging for MMS. In this study, laser DED fabrication and heat treatment of stainless steel 420 (SS420) and Inconel 718 (IN718) MMS are investigated. Different compositions of SS420 and IN718 alloys for the multi-material regions were investigated and performance were found to be weaker than the parent materials. The present study improved this multi-material regions’ performance by devising a specialized heat treatment for the SS420 and IN718 multi-material structures. Five different coupons (by weight): 100% SS420, 75% SS420 + 25% IN718, 50% SS420 + 50% IN718, 25% SS420 + 75% IN718, and 100% IN718 were fabricated using laser-DED process. The mechanical performance was correlated to the microstructural features, before and after heat treatment, using destructive and non-destructive techniques. The result was a novel SS420 + IN718 mixture chemistry that had properties comparable to the parent alloys, thus eliminating a weak link in the MMS. © 2022, ASM International.","additive manufacturing; heat treatment; laser processing; multi-material structures; superalloys","3D printers; Additives; Consumer products; Fabrication; Nondestructive examination; Stainless steel; Superalloys; Directed energy; Effect of heat treatments; Energy depositions; Inconel 718 alloy; Inconel-718; Laser process; Multi-functional; Multi-material regions; Multi-material structure; Performance; Heat treatment","","","","","Government of the Republic of Turkey; Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy, ARPA-E, (DE-AR0001123); Michigan State University, MSU","This work was partially supported by the Department of Energy Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) under cooperative agreement DE-AR0001123 with Michigan State University.

Given the recent developments of endoscopic capsules and their added value for the diagnosis and the treatment of gastrointestinal pathologies, the paper is focused on the design of a microbiota sampling capsule. The device has to offer an efficient collection of intestinal liquid and at the same time to protect it from any contamination as the device navigates out of the human body. To ensure this and safety at the same time, a passive capsule is developed based on a bistable mechanical structure actuated by an expanding foam that itself collects the intestinal fluid. The device is developed using additive manufacturing. It is shown that the process is compatible with the production of the complete capsule with biocompatible material, while ensuring the presence of bistability for capsule closing. In-vitro trials validate the operating mode of the capsule. This work represents a significant step toward the creation of simple and yet efficient tools to better understand microbiota impact and future pathology detection.

In line with this concept, this paper introduces a new innovative infill pattern inspired by a variety of strut-base lattice structures that is stronger and more material-efficient than conventional 3D printing infill. This research provides the design, analysis, and experimental results of the developed 3D printed infills, then compared with a benchmark infill. Three (3) strut-based lattice test samples, namely Body-Centered Cubic (BCC), Face-Centered Cubic (FCC), and Octet-Truss, were designed and 3D printed with an equal amount of material used, then undergo compressive test on Universal Testing Machine. Results showed that BCC, FCC, and Octet-truss infill pattern print has a compressive strength of 11.25 MPa, 8.47 MPa, 7.44 MPa consecutively, while benchmark infill has 9.73 MPa. This data proves that with the same amount of material consumed, the BCC lattice structure infill withstands a compressive load higher than the benchmark infill, which is offered in a 3D printing slicer. © 2022 Penerbit UTM Press.

Also, with the significantly growing automotive sector, innovation in electric machine technology is evolving rapidly. With the unmatched freedom in geometry, AM offers a great deal of flexibility in the design of electrical machine parts. Not only the passive parts can be printed such as the frame and the shaft of the electrical machine, but also active parts, such as windings, can be printed in lightweight materials such as Al-Si-Mg-based alloy. The main focus of this article is to further utilize AM in the design of electrical machine windings, with low weight and low losses especially at high-frequency (HF) operation. Aiming at HF loss reduction, different AM coils are prototyped using different materials, and their performance is compared with traditionally manufactured coils. Moreover, a new design concept of shaped-profile conductors is presented with reduced proximity effect and less impact by the cross-slot leakage flux. This design combines high electromagnetic performance and ultralightweight merits, allowing for higher power density electrical machines.  © 2015 IEEE.","3-D printed windings; additive manufacturing (AM); electrical machines; proximity effects; shape profiled coils","Aluminum alloys; Automotive industry; Electric drives; Machine windings; Magnesium alloys; Silicon alloys; Winding; 3d printed winding; Coil; Conductor; Electrical machine; Proximity effects; Shape; Shape profiled coil; Three-dimensional-printing; Ultra-light; 3D printers","","","","","","","Peter M., Fleischer J., Blanc F.S.-L., Jastrzembski J.-P., New conceptual lightweight design approaches for integrated manufacturing processes: Influence of alternative materials on the process chain of electric motor manufacturing, Proc. 3rd Int.

In this study, a novel high-energy-absorption spherical hollow structure (SHS) was first engineered with a layer-wise failure mode and crystal-inspired grain boundaries through the variation of its hierarchical microstructures. To engineer the strength distribution of SHS, the mechanical properties of its spherical unit cells with bending-dominated and stretch-dominated honeycomb microstructures was experimentally studied with respect to different microstructural densities. Simulations were also performed to further reveal their failure mechanisms. Based on the relationship between the microstructural densities and the mechanical responses of these unit cells, a failure mode engineering method was proposed to artificially control the failure sequence of the lattice structure through a microstructural-controlled strength distribution. Here, we demonstrated a laminated failure mode composite hierarchical SHS lattice with crystal-inspired bending and stretch-dominated grains was developed using AM. Compared to different energy-absorption material designs with similar density, the quasi-static compressive results indicated that a hierarchical SHS lattice possesses a 72% improvement in the specific energy absorption, a 50% higher density-normalized plateau stress owing to the constraining effect of its mesoscale grain boundaries, and an increased number of intensively engineered laminated failure levels. This manuscript proposes a new design paradigm of AM high energy-absorption lattice structure for different protective applications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Bio-inspired; Composite structures; Energy absorption; Failure mode engineering; Metamaterials","Additives; Aerospace industry; Biomechanics; Biomimetics; Energy absorption; Failure (mechanical); Failure modes; Grain boundaries; Laminated composites; Metamaterials; Microstructure; Bio-inspired; Composites structures; Failure mode engineering; Grain-boundaries; Hierarchical microstructures; High-energy absorption; Hollow structure; Micro-structural; Strength distribution; Unit cells; 3D printers","","","","","Shanghai Sailing Program, (20YF1419200); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai, (20ZR1427500); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (896742); H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/P006566/1, EP/V061798/1, EP/W003333/1, EP/W037483/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52004160, 52075327); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Science and Technology Major Project of Guangxi, (Z2020001); Science and Technology Major Project of Guangxi","This work was sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 52075327 and 52004160 ); Shanghai Sailing Program ( 20YF1419200 ); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai ( 20ZR1427500 ); and Major Science and Technology Project of Huaibei ( Z2020001 ).

Clinical treatment involves bony bar resection and implantation of an interpositional material, but success is limited and the bony bar often reforms. No treatment attempts to regenerate the growth plate cartilage. Herein we develop a 3D printed growth plate mimetic composite as a potential regenerative medicine approach with the goal of preventing limb length discrepancies and inducing cartilage regeneration. A poly(ethylene glycol)-based resin was used with digital light processing to 3D print a mechanical support structure infilled with a soft cartilage-mimetic hydrogel containing chondrogenic cues. Our biomimetic composite has similar mechanical properties to native rabbit growth plate and induced chondrogenic differentiation of rabbit mesenchymal stromal cells in vitro. We evaluated its efficacy as a regenerative interpositional material applied after bony bar resection in a rabbit model of growth plate injury. Radiographic imaging was used to monitor limb length and tibial plateau angle, microcomputed tomography assessed bone morphology, and histology characterized the repair tissue that formed. Our 3D printed growth plate mimetic composite resulted in improved tibial lengthening compared to an untreated control, cartilage-mimetic hydrogel only condition, and a fat graft. However, in vivo the 3D printed growth plate mimetic composite did not show cartilage regeneration within the construct histologically. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates the feasibility of a 3D printed biomimetic composite to improve limb lengthening, a key functional outcome, supporting its further investigation as a treatment for growth plate injuries. © 2022, The Author(s).","","3D printers; Biomechanics; Biomimetics; Bone; Computerized tomography; Hydrogels; Plates (structural components); Polyethylene glycols; Population statistics; Repair; Stem cells; aggrecan; biomimetic material; collagen type 10; collagen type 2; hydrogel; macrogol; monomer; resin; Biomimetic composites; Cartilage regeneration; Clinical treatments; Growth plate; Mimetics; Pediatric population; Poly(ethylene glycol); Rabbit models; Regenerative medicine; Repair tissues; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; atomic force microscopy; bone injury; cell differentiation; cell structure; cell viability; chondrogenesis; comparative study; controlled study; degradation; epiphysis; epiphysis plate; female; growth plate injury; histopathology; immunofluorescence assay; in vitro study; leg lengthening; male; mechanics; mesenchymal stroma cell; metaphysis; micro-computed tomography; nonhuman; protein expression; quantitative analysis; rabbit model; scanning electron microscopy; three dimensional printing; tibial plateau; tissue repair; tissue section; Cartilage","","macrogol, 25322-68-3","","","Gates Grubstake Fund, (T32 GM065103); National Science Foundation, NSF; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R33HD090696); National Institutes of Health, NIH; U.S. Department of Education, ED; National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","Funding text 1: Research reported in this publication was supported by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under Award Number R33HD090696 and the Gates Grubstake Fund.

Therefore, a surface finishing is necessary in most cases. Due to a high material removal rate, centrifugal disc finishing is a promising mass finishing operation for an effective surface finishing of additive manufactured parts. However, due to machining the workpieces in a freely movable manner, the process is hardly controllable, and the process design is often based on time-consuming and cost-intensive trial-and-error approaches. Especially when it comes to the machining of complex-shaped workpieces, finishing results are barely predictable. Therefore, the aim of this study is to set up a numerical simulation of the centrifugal disc finishing based on the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to predict finishing results. A procedure to determine the required DEM input parameters is presented and the simulation was validated using a freely movable force sensor. The results of the finishing experiments with additive manufactured workpieces made of Ti-6Al-4V were correlated with the simulated results. The derived correlation was used to predict local differences in the roughness reduction, which occurred when finishing workpieces with a limited accessibility to the surface. As a result, it is concluded that the complex relationship between the type of media, the accessibility to the surface, and the achievable finishing results can be modeled using the DEM. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufactured workpieces; centrifugal disc finishing; discrete element method; mass finishing; modeling; roughness reduction","","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (460895790)","This research was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) (Bonn, Germany) within the scope of the project “Nachbearbeitung additiv gefertigter Werkstücke mittels Fliehkraftgleitschleifen”, project number 460895790.","Gillespie L.K., Mass Finishing Handbook, (2006); Uhlmann E., Eulitz A., Seiffert K., Kersting R., Schenk S., Finishing of additive manufactured titanium parts—Potentials of centrifugal disc finishing, Werkstattstech.

This work takes the next step in this evolution by demonstrating the fabrication and subsequent evaluation of Fabry–Pérot interferometers (FPIs). Large optical area (centimetre scale) Fabry–Pérot transmission filters have been 3D printed with polylactic acid (PLA) using a commonly used low-cost 3D printer. The advantages of the proposed approach include low cost, rapid prototyping and repeatability. Terahertz transmission measurements for two demonstrated filter designs realised to target optimisation of either signal transmission or spectral filter performance have been performed using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) and demonstrate good agreement with the simulated response in the operating spectral band of 0.30–0.75 THz (wavelengths from 1000 down to 400 μm). The critical spectral characteristics assessed were the filter peak transmission magnitude, central wavelength and full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the transmission peak, as well as the free spectral range (FSR). The signal transmission levels were observed to reach beyond 90% for the first series of filters that targeted optimisation of this aspect; however, this was accompanied by diminished out-of-band rejection and broader transmission peaks in comparison to the second series of filters which targeted the overall performance. For the latter filter series, the resolution in terms of FWHM values of the transmission peaks was reduced to 40–50 GHz, with the out-of-band rejection approaching a ratio of 10:1. This level of spectral performance, along with the achieved signal peak transmission characteristics of 65–75%, provides adequate performance for many applications harnessing the terahertz spectral range. © 2022, Crown.","3D printing; Fabry–Pérot Interferometers; Polylactic acid; Terahertz","3D printers; Costs; Laser pulses; Notch filters; Polyesters; Reflectometers; Transmissions; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Full widths at half maximums; Low-costs; Polylactic acid; Signal transmission; Tera Hertz; Terahertz spectral range; Transmission filters; Transmission peaks; Terahertz spectroscopy","","","","","Australian National Fabrication Facility, ANFF; Australian Research Council, ARC; Department of Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation, Government of Western Australia, JTSI","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by the Australian Research Council, the Australian National Fabrication Facility and the Western Australian Government’s Department of Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation. ; Funding text 2: This work was performed in the Western Australian node of the Australian National Fabrication Facility (ANFF), a company established under the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy to provide nano and micro-fabrication facilities for Australian researchers.

For this present analysis, a vertically configured shrouded plate finned channel is considered. From the literature, it is observed that in the solution of mixed convection problems related to the various engineering applications, proper estimation of induced velocity and fan/pump velocity plays a vital role. For this cause, segregation of the velocity components of free and forced convection present in the mixed convection becomes important. There exist two methods available in the literature, namely, first, the natural convection computational fluid dynamics method (NCM) used in the mixed convection computational fluid dynamics analysis under the same thermal and geometrical conditions, and second, forced convection decoupled method (FDM) applying the same pressure drop in forced and mixed convection across the channel. Results of this study reveal that if the free or induced velocity component present in the mixed convection is assessed based on the forced convection decoupled method, the pumping power results may be more precise than the natural convection computational fluid dynamic method as in the later method calculation of the forced convection velocity component is underpredicted. The natural convection velocity component evaluated through NCM varies 33% to 65.7% from the FDM based on the shroud clearance for the constant fin heights of 0.04 m. This variation is as high as 98% and 96% in the case of the larger nondimensional fin spacing of 0.3 and 0.5, respectively. A correlation of overall Nusselt number is suggested for a vertically configured shrouded dual-height plate finned channel evaluating appropriate Reynolds through the forced convection decoupled method.

Three different mass percentages (0.5, 1, and 2 wt%) of MWCNT are added to the CP powder and a slurry is prepared using a CMC binder for printing the scaffolds. The scaffolds were printed in 2 infill ratios, 50 and 100%, and were sintered under an inert atmosphere in a microwave furnace which was then taken for various characterization studies. Physical characterisation studies revealed that the shrinkage rate of scaffolds is very low compared to other additive manufacturing techniques. The incorporation of 0.5 wt% of MWCNT produced the best results in mechanical characterization studies with a compressive strength of 10.38 MPa and 11.89 MPa for 50% and 100% infill ratios respectively. In Vitro Biocompatibility studies also proved that 0.5 wt% MWCNT samples are the most suitable for cell growth while the hemocompatibility tests showed that the samples are blood compatible. The 100% infill samples fared better than the 50% samples in physical and mechanical properties. The results suggest that the MWCNT incorporated CP scaffolds can be used to treat critical size bone defects. © 2022","Bone tissue engineering; Calcium phosphate; Carbon nanotube; Critical size bone defects; Microwave sintering; Robocasting; Scaffold","Calcium Phosphates; Microwaves; Nanotubes, Carbon; Porosity; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; Biocompatibility; Biomechanics; Bone; Calcium phosphate; Compressive strength; Defects; Infill drilling; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Scaffolds (biology); Shrinkage; Sintering; argon; calcium phosphate; molecular scaffold; multi walled nanotube; calcium phosphate; carbon nanotube; Bone defect; Bone tissue engineering; Characterization studies; Critical size; Critical size bone defect; Mechanical characterizations; Microwave sintering; Multi-walled-carbon-nanotubes; Physical characterization; Robocasting; airflow; Article; biocompatibility; biomineralization; blood compatibility; bone regeneration; bone tissue; cell growth; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell viability; ceramics; compressive strength; controlled study; differential thermal analysis; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; field emission scanning electron microscopy; flow kinetics; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; furnace; in vitro study; mechanics; microwave radiation; physical chemistry; Raman spectrometry; robocasting; shear rate; thermogravimetry; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; viscosity; X ray diffraction; microwave radiation; porosity; procedures; Cell proliferation","","argon, 7440-37-1; calcium phosphate, 10103-46-5, 13767-12-9, 14358-97-5, 7758-87-4; calcium phosphate, ; Calcium Phosphates, ; Nanotubes, Carbon, ","","","Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai, VIT; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी, (SRG/2019/002038); Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी","Funding text 1: The authors are grateful to DST-SERB, the Government of India, who provided fund for the research work through the Start-up Research Grant (SRG/2019/002038).

However, due to the uncertainty of the reverse material flow, the planning of a remanufacturing reverse logistics system is complex. Furthermore, the increasing adoption of disruptive technologies in Industry 4.0/5.0, e.g., the Internet of things (IoT), smart robots, cloud-based digital twins, and additive manufacturing, has shown great potential for a smart paradigm transition of remanufacturing reverse logistics operations. In this paper, a new mixed-integer program is modeled for supporting several tactical decisions in remanufacturing reverse logistics, i.e., remanufacturing setups, production planning and inventory levels, core acquisition and transportation, and remanufacturing line balancing and utilization. The model is further extended by incorporating utilization-dependent nonlinear idle time cost constraints and stochastic takt time to accommodate different real-world scenarios. Through a set of numerical experiments, the influences of different demand patterns and idle time constraints are revealed. The potential impacts of disruptive technology adoption in remanufacturing reverse logistics are also discussed from managerial perspectives, which may help remanufacturing companies with a smart and smooth transition in the Industry 4.0/5.0 era. © 2022, The Author(s).","Decision-support system;

Embedding cells in 3D microenvironments or controlling their 3D assembly by bioprinting can enhance their physiological properties, which is beneficial for modeling diseases in vitro. A potential cellular source for modeling renal tubular physiology and kidney diseases in vitro are directly reprogrammed induced renal tubular epithelial cells (iRECs). iRECs were cultured in various biomaterials and as bioprinted tubular structures. They showed high compatibility with the embedding substrates and dispensing methods. The morphology of multicellular aggregates was substantially influenced by the 3D microenvironment. Transcriptomic analyses revealed signatures of differentially expressed genes specific to each of the selected biomaterials. Using a new cellular model for autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease, Pkd1−/− iRECs showed disrupted morphology in bioprinted tubules and a marked upregulation of the Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a1 (Aldh1a1). In conclusion, 3D microenvironments strongly influence the morphology and expression profiles of iRECs, help to unmask disease phenotypes, and can be adapted to experimental demands. Combining a direct reprogramming approach with appropriate biomaterials will facilitate construction of biomimetic kidney tubules and disease models at the microscale. © 2022 The Authors","Bioprinting; Direct reprogramming; Disease modeling; ECM-Like biomaterials; Kidney tubules; Polycystic kidney disease","Biocompatible Materials; Biomimetics; Epithelial Cells; Humans; Kidney; Polycystic Kidney Diseases; Biomimetics; Cell culture; Cells; Embeddings; Physiology; alginic acid; biomimetic material; hydrogel; transcriptome; biomaterial; Bioprinting; Direct reprogramming; Disease models; ECM-like biomaterial; Epithelial cells; Kidney tubules; Microenvironments; Physiological properties; Polycystic kidney disease; Tubulars; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; biocompatibility; bioprinting; cell cloning; cell growth; cell reprogramming technique; cell viability; cell viability assay; chromosome segregation; controlled study; DNA replication; gene ontology; image analysis; immunofluorescence; immunofluorescence assay; kidney polycystic disease; kidney tubule cell; microenvironment; mouse; nonhuman; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA sequence; three dimensional cell culture; transcriptomics; Western blotting; biomimetics; epithelium cell; human; kidney; Morphology","","alginic acid, 28961-37-7, 29894-36-8, 9005-32-7, 9005-38-3; Biocompatible Materials, ","Axio Observer Z1, Carl Zeiss, Germany","Carl Zeiss, Germany","Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg; Berlin Institute of Health at Charité; Baden-Württemberg Stiftung, BWS; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; Universität Zürich, UZH; Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin; European Research Council, ERC; Berlin Institute of Health, BIH; Life Imaging Center, University of Freiburg; Angelina Bogus, (SFB 1140- KIDGEM, DFG 1504/9-1, LI1817/2-1, KA5060/1-1, KU 1504/8-1); Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (310030_189102); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (804474); European Renal Association, (ERA-EDTA ALTF 84–2011)","Funding text 1: We thank Angelina Bogus, Amos Spielmann and Daniel Invernot P\u00E9rez for excellent technical support.

By using the LC technique, the laser cladding sheet (LC sheet) can be realised by overlapping track-by-track in a layer and layer-by-layer through the depth of the sheet. However, the lack of knowledge on the structural performance of this LC sheet impedes the application of the LC technique in building and civil infrastructure. Accordingly, this paper presents the first results of a wide experimental campaign aimed at evaluating the material behaviour of LC sheets. In this investigation, the mechanical properties, degree of anisotropy and microstructure of the LC sheets produced by using commercial 316 L stainless steel powder were studied. Through tensile tests, the influences of the scanning pattern, specimen orientation and thickness on the mechanical properties of the LC sheets were investigated. The test results revealed the elastic isotropy for the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio, and the plastic anisotropy for the proof stresses, ultimate stress and elongation, but the degree of anisotropy for most of the plastic mechanical properties was less than 20%. The microindentation hardness of the LC sheets was measured, and the linear correlation between the ultimate strength and hardness of the LC sheets was established. Microstructure analyses using metallographic and SEM tests demonstrated that the observations on the mechanical properties could be explained and rationalised by the specific microstructural features. © 2022","Additive manufacture; Laser cladding; Mechanical properties; Microstructure","3D printers; Additives; Anisotropy; Austenitic stainless steel; Hardness; Microstructure; Tensile testing; 316 L stainless steel; Additive manufacture; Degrees of anisotropy; In-buildings; Laser cladding technique; Layer by layer; Manufacturing techniques; Properties and microstructures; Stainless steel sheets; Structural performance; Laser cladding","","","","","Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Modern Civil Engineering Technology, (2021B1212040003); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52178286); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2020A1515011070); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Building Science, (2022KB14); State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Building Science","This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 52178286 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province ( 2020A1515011070 ), the State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Building Science ( 2022KB14 ) and the Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Modern Civil Engineering Technology ( 2021B1212040003 ).

Across the seven existing AM processes, we observe a variety of defects in printed parts, due to the different physical properties of each manufacturing process. This variety of defects complicates the design step without a clear overview of the deep interaction geometry-process-defect. The classification of these defects, which may be process- or machine-based, often raises methodological and terminological issues. In this paper, a review of AM general part defects using a process-based approach, is proposed. The aim of this paper is to provide the designer with a classification that would allow to make choices in the part design, by taking stock of the different defects affecting the resulting part considering the chosen process. For each process category defined in ISO/ASTM 52900, the main properties and defects of parts are reviewed and classified into four families: geometry and dimensions, surface quality, microstructure and mechanical properties. This review focuses in particular, on the process parameters which affect declined defects and properties allowing a relevant choice of the designer with respect to the process or the expected requirements of the part. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Additive manufacturing processes; Geometry and dimension; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Surface quality","3D printers; Additives; Microstructure; Surface properties; Additive manufacturing process; Design freedom; Design steps; Geometry and dimension; Geometry process; Interaction geometries; Manufacturing IS; Manufacturing process; Manufacturing technologies; Property; Geometry","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (779790)","","Gibson I., Rosen D.W., Stucker B., Additive Manufacturing Technologies: Rapid Prototyping to Direct Digital Manufacturing, (2010); Beyer C., Figueroa D., Design and analysis of lattice structures for additive manufacturing, J.

Observations reveal characteristic elements partitioning in the liquid during additive manufacturing. Due to this microsegregation, complex multiphase precipitation occurs and the various precipitates are identified and characterized in a cobalt-based superalloy fabricated by DED. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are used to investigate the spatial distribution and nature of the various phases detected in the as-fabricated microstructure. Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), wavelength dispersive X-ray spectrometry (WDS), and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) are coupled with a fine analysis of the diffraction patterns to identify the different phases decorating the interdendritic regions. These characterizations allow the identification of different submicronic precipitates: Al2O3, (Ta,Ti)(N,C), HfO2, Cr3B2 and (Ti,Zr,Hf)2SC. The solidification sequence is discussed at light of the experimental results.

The high drapability of textiles offers design opportunities for new concrete structures. However, commonly utilized textiles are impregnated with comparatively stiff polymeric materials to ensure load transmission into the textile, limiting drapability. In this paper, a new approach is analyzed: the use of pre-impregnated textiles cured within the concrete matrix. This enables the production of filigree, highly curved components with high mechanical performance, as needed for novel additive manufacturing methods. In the presented trials, rovings were successfully impregnated with potential impregnation materials, cured within the concrete, and compared to rovings cured outside of the concrete. The analysis of the curing process using a rolling ball test determines that all materials have to be placed in concrete 4 to 24 h after impregnation. The results of uniaxial tensile tests on reinforced concrete show that maximum load is increased by up to 87% for rovings cured within concrete (compared to non-impregnated rovings). This load increase was higher for rovings cured outside of concrete (up to 185%), indicating that the concrete environment interferes with the curing process, requiring further analysis and adaptation. © 2022 by the authors.","carbon; carbon-reinforced concrete (CRC); coating; prepreg; reinforcement textile; textile-reinforced concrete (TRC)","","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (417002380); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG","This research was funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)–SFB/TRR 280.

Hence, I4.0-driven CE-oriented supply chains (SCs) have improved sustainable performance, flexibility and interoperability. In order to smoothly embrace circular practices in digitally enabled SCs, quantitative techniques have been identified as crucial. Therefore, the intersection of I4.0, CE, supply chain management (SCM) and quantitative techniques is an emerging research arena worthy of investigation. This article presents a bibliometric analysis to identify the established and evolving research clusters in the topological analysis by identifying collaboration patterns, interrelations and the studies that significantly dominate the intersection of the analysed fields. Further, this study investigates the current research trends and presents potential directions for future research. The bibliometric analysis highlights that additive manufacturing (AM), big data analytics (BDA) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are the most researched technologies within the intersection of CE and sustainable SCM. Evaluation of intellectual, conceptual and social structures revealed that I4.0-driven sustainable operations and manufacturing are emerging research fields. This study provides research directions to guide scholars in the further investigation of these four identified fields while exploring the potential quantitative methods and techniques that can be applied in I4.0-enabled SCs in the CE context. © 2022, The Author(s).","Circular economy; Industry 4.0; Quantitative methods; Supply chain management","","","","","","Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks, (H2020-MSCA-ITN-2018); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (814247)","This research has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks (H2020-MSCA-ITN-2018) scheme, grant agreement number 814247 (ReTraCE project).

Consequently, there is continuing demand for the development of innovative and sustainable humidity sensor solutions. Here, the development and characterization of fully additively manufactured, highly sensitive, resistive Chitosan-based humidity sensors on flexible thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) foil, as well as on a glass carrier substrate are presented. The sensors unite aspects of sustainability and high performance in a broad humidity range (20-90%rH). The humidity response follows an exponential curve progression with relative changes in the resistance per %rH of 6.9% and 5.7% for the glass carrier sensor and the TPU sensor, respectively. In absolute values, this means that the Chitosan-based sensors are particularly sensitive in the low humidity range with a vast dynamic range (ten times larger compared to commonly used capacitive humidity sensors). The flexible sensor on the TPU substrate shows great stability even after repeated bending. In addition, the combination of flexible and biocompatible materials (TPU and Chitosan) with additive manufacturing technologies makes the sensor particularly sustainable while having great potential for a plethora of biomedical applications. © 2017 IEEE.","additive manufacturing; Chitosan; flexible electronics; humidity sensor; Sensor phenomena; sensors; sustainable sensors","Biocompatibility; Capacitive sensors; Chitosan; Flexible electronics; Glass; Glass substrates; Humidity control; Humidity sensors; Medical applications; Biocompatible polymer; Carrier substrate; Exponential curves; Glass carrier; Humidity response; Performance; Physical parameters; Polymer substrate; Sustainable sensor; Thermoplastic polyurethanes; 3D printers","","","","","","","Forti V., Balde C., Kuehr R., Bel G., The global E-waste monitor 2020: Quantities, flows and the circular economy potential, (2020); Industrial sensors market; Wu W., Inorganic nanomaterials for printed electronics: A review, Nanoscale, 9, pp. 7342-7372, (2017); Wiklund J., Et al., A review on printed electronics: Fabrication methods, inks, substrates, applications and environmental impacts, J.

The CS process is difficult to be accurately simulated, and the underlying coating mechanisms, especially for multi-powders CS, have not been well understood. As a Lagrangian and particle method, the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method has natural advantages in treating large deformations and capturing moving interfaces. In this work, we present an improved SPH approach to implement three-dimensional particle modeling and study of the multi-layer multi-track CS problem. The kernel gradient correction (KGC), adaptive smoothing length and the constitutive model are integrated in the improved SPH. The contour profile and width thickness ratio of the deformed powder obtained by the present simulation are very close to the experimental results. The bonding behaviors in a single powder CS with different materials are first explained where the critical velocities for different materials are obtained. Furthermore, coating behaviors in CS with different layers and tracks of powders are comprehensively analyzed. Some typical deformation parameters of the powders track with regard to an increasing impacting velocity are attained. With the present numerical model, a larger scale multi-layer multi-track CS is promising to be reproduced with some parameter windows predicted, which is greatly helpful to CS operations. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Additive manufacturing;

Challenging SML methodologies are the new computational paradigms named Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). PINN has revolutionized the classical adoption of ML in scientific computing, representing a novel class of promising algorithms where the learning process is constrained to satisfy known physical laws described by differential equations. In this paper, we propose a PINN-based computational study to deal with a non-linear partial differential equations system. In particular, using this approach, we solve the Gray-Scott model, a reaction–diffusion system that involves an irreversible chemical reaction between two reactants. In the unstable region of the model, we consider some a priori information related to dynamical behaviors, i. e. a supervised approach that relies on a finite difference method (FDM). Finally, simulation results show that PINNs can successfully provide an approximated Grey-Scott system solution, reproducing the characteristic Turing patterns for different parameter configurations. © 2022, The Author(s).","Gray-Scott systems; Physics-Informed Neural Networks; Scientific Machine Learning","","","","","","UMI-AI; UMI-TAA; Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, UNINA; Department of Matemathics and Applications, (80126)","Funding text 1: SC is a member of GNCS-INdAM, UMI-TAA and UMI-AI Italian research groups.; Funding text 2: The paper was financially supported by the DAMM project (ex-numeracy), University of Naples Federico II, Department of Matemathics and Applications \u201CR.

Direct energy deposition (DED), one of the AM processes, is widely used nowadays for its high deposition rate. When using DED process in manufacturing or repairing, it is important to know the melt pool dimensions as a function of processing parameters to obtain high deposition rate and avoid defects such as lack of fusion. In this study, we used the random forest (RF) algorithm to predict melt pool dimensions and compared the results against existing physics based lumped model by Doumanidis et al. [1]. The results show that RF model works well to predict the DED melt pool dimensions, where energy density and material volume deposited govern the dimensions. Further, we tested the ubiquitous semi-ellipsoidal shape assumption for DED cross section against the circular shape and found semi-ellipsoidal shape to be fair when deposition process is stable and free of defects. Overall, this study highlights the applicability of machine learning algorithms for small AM datasets. © 2022, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.","Directed energy deposition; Melt pool shape; Regression analysis; Ti-6Al-4V","Aluminum alloys; Decision trees; Defects; Forecasting; Lakes; Machine learning; Random forests; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Deposition process; Directed energy; Directed energy deposition; Energy depositions; High deposition rates; Manufacturing IS; Melt pool; Melt pool shape; Pool shape; Ti-6al-4v; Regression analysis","","","","","Office of Naval Research, ONR; Colorado School of Mines, CSM","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Quality Made program led by Lockheed Martin under prime contract N00014-18-C-1026 from the Office of Naval Research.

Using a 6-DOF robotic arm with a hybrid Additive Manufacturing (AM)/Pick and Place (PnP) end effector, the workcell can rapidly print enclosures, insert and wire functional electronics, and embed them into the printed structure. The workcell's scalable control system, digital workflow for creating assembly instructions, hybrid AM/PnP toolhead design, and autonomous part tending mechanism are detailed. In addition, a modular electronics infrastructure is presented to enable facile, error-free robotic wiring of large-gauge copper wire. The workcell's ability to manufacture is verified in a case study wherein it is used to autonomously fabricate a variety of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs). In the study, the workcell produces a functional quadrotor drone, releases the drone from the workcell, and allows the drone to record the workcell constructing a second, different drone - all without human involvement. The resulting workcell, which combines digitally-integrated manufacturing, robotics and automation, and hybrid process manufacturing, enables autonomous manufacture of complete, functional mechatronic systems that are tailored to custom design needs in a just-in-time manner. © 2022","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Hybrid manufacturing; Modular electronics; Robotic workcell; Unmanned aerial systems","","","","","","","","McDonald E., Wicker R., (2016); Cham J.G., Pruitt B.L., Cutkosky M.R., Binnard M., Weiss L.E., Neplotnik G., Layered Manufacturing With Embedded Components: process Planning Considerations, 4th Design for Manufacturing Conference, 4, (1999); Kataria A., Rosen D.W., Building around inserts: methods for fabricating complex devices in stereolithography, Rapid Prototyp.

This study used algorithms based on scaling factors to design Voronoi scaffolds (pore sizes 600–1200 μm). Scaffolds were prepared from β-tricalcium phosphate slurry and 3D printed using stereolithography. Characterization analysis revealed that the microporous structures were correctly processed. Computational fluid dynamics indicated that scaffold permeability increased and the specific surface area decreased with increasing pore size, and the wall shear stress was highest in P800 scaffolds (pore size-800 μm). In addition, MC3T3 cells were dynamically seeded and were more evenly distributed and showed higher proliferation and differentiation on the P800 scaffold than the other three scaffolds in vitro. For in vivo experiment, scaffolds were implanted into rabbit femur to analyze the degradation and osteogenesis. Histological and imaging examinations revealed that new bone formation was more abundant on the surface and inside of the P800 scaffold than the other three scaffolds, which was explained by the hydrodynamic response. This study optimized a controllable method for designing Voronoi scaffolds and indicated that the pore size distribution of the P800 scaffold (458.8–989.1 μm) is an optimal choice for trabecular scaffolds. © 2022 The Authors","Biodegradable Voronoi scaffold; Computational fluid dynamics; Osteogenesis; Pore size; Stereolithography; β-tricalcium phosphate","Biomimetics; Bone; Computational fluid dynamics; Scaffolds (biology); Shear stress; Stereolithography; Biodegradable voronoi scaffold; Fluid dynamic analysis; Fluid-dynamic analysis; Microporous structures; Osteogenesis; Scaling factors; Tri-calcium phosphates; Voronoi; Wall-shear stress; Β-tricalcium phosphate; Pore size","","","","","Key Research Project of Shaanxi Province, (2017ZDCXL-SF-01-05); National Key Research and Development Project of the People's Republic of China; National Key Research and Development Project of the People’s Republic of China, (2018YFE0114200); State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Key Research Project of Shaanxi Province (2017ZDCXL-SF-01-05), and the National Key Research and Development Project of the People’s Republic of China (No. 2018YFE0114200) ; Funding text 2: The authors would like to thank Professor Bingheng Lu (The State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, PR China) for technical assistance in stereolithography 3D printing.

Accurate prediction of WAAM part dimension is fundamentally dependent on the modeling accuracy of single-bead profile and its subsequent overlapping ones. This paper proposes a new recursive model, based on coordinate transformation, to predict single-layer multi-bead overlapping profile. Firstly, commonly used single-bead profile functions are reviewed, followed by detailed description of conventional and proposed recursive profile model. The properties of developed recursive model are then investigated for understanding the effects of overlapping ratio and single-bead aspect ratio. The influence of function type is also analysed from the surface quality divergence of single-layer multi-bead overlapping profile. Finally, multi-bead overlapping experimental tests are carried out to validate the feasibility of presented recursive profile model. The results show that the modified recursive model is more accurate than the conventional one for its better accountability of valley area. It is also indicated that parabola and arc function are more suitable for the robotic WAAM process. The research outcome is beneficial to improving the forming accuracy of WAAM parts, and also provides a new method for predicting geometry of other additive manufactured products. © 2022","Multi-bead overlapping model; Recursive bead profile; Surface topography; Wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM)","Additives; Aspect ratio; Forecasting; Robotics; Topography; Wire; Large-scales; Manufacturing IS; Multi beads; Multi-bead overlapping model; Profile transformation; Recursive bead profile; Recursive modeling; Single layer; Transformation based; Wire and arc additive manufacturing; 3D printers","","","","","Public Service Platform for Technical Innovation of Machine Tool Industry in Fujian Province; Science & Technology Major Project of Fujian Province, China, (2020HZ03018); Start-up Foundation of Fujian University of Technology, (E0600276); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, (2020J01873)","Funding text 1: This work was financially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province , China (Grant No. 2020J01873 ), Science & Technology Major Project of Fujian Province, China (Grant No. 2020HZ03018 ) and Start-up Foundation of Fujian University of Technology (Grant No. E0600276 ). ; Funding text 2: The authors are thankful for the support from Public Service Platform for Technical Innovation of Machine Tool Industry in Fujian Province.","Jiang J., Hu G., Li X., Et al., Analysis and prediction of printable bridge length in fused deposition modelling based on back propagation neural network, Virtual Phys Prototyp, 14, 3, pp. 253-266, (2019); Yang D., He C., Zhang G., Et al., Forming characteristics of thin-wall steel parts by double electrode GMAW based additive manufacturing, J Mater Process Technol, 227, pp. 153-160, (2016); Zhang Y., Bernard A., Harik R., Et al., Build orientation optimization for multi-part production in additive manufacturing, J Intell Manuf, 28, 6, pp. 1393-1407, (2015); Mok S.H., Bi G., Folkes J., Et al., Deposition of Ti–6Al–4V using a high power diode laser and wire, part I: investigation on the process characteristics, Surf Coat Technol, 202, 16, pp. 3933-3939, (2008); Brandl E., Michailov V., Viehweger B., Et al., Deposition of Ti–6Al–4V using laser and wire, part I: microstructural properties of single beads, Surf Coat Technol, 206, 6, pp. 1120-1129, (2011); Sproesser G., Chang Y., Pittner A., Et al., Energy efficiency and environmental impacts of high power gas metal arc welding, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 91, pp. 3503-3513, (2017); Stenbacka N., Et al., On arc efficiency in gas tungsten arc welding, Soldag Insp, 18, 4, pp. 380-390, (2013); Cunningham C., Flynn J., Shokrani A., Et al., Invited review article: strategies and processes for high quality wire arc additive manufacturing, Addit Manuf, 22, pp. 672-686, (2018); Las-casas M.S., Diniz de Avila T.L., Bracarense A.Q., Et al., Weld parameter prediction using artificial neural network: FN and geometric parameter prediction of austenitic stainless steel welds, J Braz Soc Mech Sci Eng, 40, (2018); Wu B., Pan Z., Ding D., Et al., A review of the wire arc additive manufacturing of metals: properties, defects and quality improvement, J Manuf Process, 35, pp. 127-139, (2018); Yang T., Xiong J., Chen H., Et al., Modeling of weld bead geometry for rapid manufacturing by robotic GMAW, Int J Mod Phys B, 29, pp. 10-11, (2015); Xiong J., Zhang G., Hu J., Et al., Bead geometry prediction for robotic GMAW-based rapid manufacturing through a neural network and a second-order regression analysis, J Intell Manuf, 25, 1, pp. 157-163, (2012); Rojas J.G.M., Ghasri-khouzani M., Wolfe T., Et al., Preliminary geometrical and microstructural characterization of WC-reinforced NiCrBSi matrix composites fabricated by plasma transferred arc additive manufacturing through taguchi-based experimentation, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 113, 5-6, pp. 1451-1468, (2021); Jahanzaib M., Hussain S., Wasim A., Et al., Modeling of weld bead geometry on HSLA steel using response surface methodology, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 89, 5-8, pp. 2087-2098, (2016); Suryakumar S., Karunakaran K.P., Bernard A., Et al., Weld bead modeling and process optimization in hybrid layered manufacturing, Comput Aided Des, 43, 4, pp. 331-344, (2011); Cao Y., Zhu S., Liang X., Et al., Overlapping model of beads and curve fitting of bead section for rapid manufacturing by robotic MAG welding process, Robot Comput Integr Manuf, 27, 3, pp. 641-645, (2011); Xiong J., Zhang G., Gao H., Et al., Modeling of bead section profile and overlapping beads with experimental validation for robotic GMAW-based rapid manufacturing, Robot Comput Integr Manuf, 29, 2, pp. 417-423, (2013); Artaza T., Suarez A., Veiga F., Et al., Wire arc additive manufacturing Ti6Al4V aeronautical parts using plasma arc welding : analysis of heat-treatment processes in different atmospheres, J.

During the process, the wire electrode is melted continuously or in a pulsating mode and deposited layer-by-layer onto a substrate. Due to the recurring energy input into the part during WAAM, adequate thermal management is crucial. The temperature distribution, especially the interlayer temperature in the part, is determined by the parameter settings as well as by the dwell times and can be monitored. This paper presents the cause-effect relationships between the interlayer temperature and the dwell times to enable a suitable temperature management. Thermal imaging was implemented during the manufacturing process, allowing the analysis of different interlayer dwell times and their effect on the interlayer temperatures. In addition, the influence of the temperature management on the geometric quality characteristics of the part was investigated. It was observed that a constant interlayer dwell time led to geometric irregularities in the part height and width. Monitoring the interlayer temperature is crucial in WAAM in order to maintain a constant temperature level along multiple layers for meeting the requirements for the geometry of the part and enabling near-net-shape manufacturing. © 2022, The Author(s).","Additive Manufacturing; Process monitoring; Thermal management; Ti-6Al-4V; WAAM","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Geometry; Infrared imaging; Process control; Process monitoring; Titanium alloys; Wire; Dwell time; Manufacturing IS; Metal parts; Near net shape; Process monitoring and control; Temperature management; Thermal process; Ti-6al-4v; Wire and arc additive manufacturing; Wire electrode; Temperature control","","","","","German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action, (20W1709D)","We hereby express our gratitude to the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action for its funding of the research activities.

Separate Al and C additions and the resulting precipitation of hard phases are commonly used to strengthen CoCrFeMnNi-type alloys. However, the combined alloying effect and especially the high hardening potential of C in solid solution of MPEAs are rarely investigated, but the few existing investigations reveal a high potential. Therefore, the properties of the Al0−22.1C0−2.3(CoFeMnNi)100−75.6 (at.%) system were comprehensively investigated, where Cr was intentionally removed to keep C in solid solution. For theoretical and experimental screening of the system, a custom CALPHAD database was extended, samples were manufactured by additive manufacturing (AM) and annealed between temperatures of 1150 and 550 °C. Detailed microstructural and mechanical analysis on 40 different revealed the properties of the equiatomic CoFeMnNi alloy and the effect of the separate and combined additions of Al and C, including comprehensive precipitate characterization. The system was especially potent in its room temperature tensile properties in the Al- and C-added FCC-based region, where it caused the activation of twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) and combined high strength and ductility increases. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; Atomic ordering; CALPHAD; Deformation twinning; High-entropy alloy; Microstructure formation mechanism","3D printers; Additives; Alloying elements; Aluminum; Aluminum alloys; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Entropy; High-entropy alloys; Iron alloys; Manganese alloys; Microstructure; Phase space methods; Plasticity; Precipitation (chemical); Solid solutions; Ternary systems; Atomic orders; Calphad; Deformation twinning; Formation mechanism; High entropy alloys; Microstructure evolutions; Microstructure formation; Microstructure formation mechanism; Properties of Al; Property; Cobalt alloys","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (388166069, 439900808, DE-82, ZUK2-SF-OPSF406)","Funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) – 388166069 and 439900808, and by the RWTH Aachen Seed-Fund project OPSF406 – G:(DE-82)ZUK2-SF-OPSF406.

The COVID-19 management guidance recommends against the use of nebulized inhalation therapy directly in the emergency room or in an ambulance to prevent possible viral transmission. The three-dimensional printing method was used to develop an aerosol inhalation treatment mask that can potentially prevent aerosol dispersion. We conducted this utility validation study to understand the practicability of this new nebulizer mask system. Results: The fit test confirmed that the filter can efficiently remove small particles. The different locations of the mask had an excellent fit with a high pressure making a proper face seal usability. The full-face mask appeared to optimize filtration with pressure and is an example of materials that perform well for improvised respiratory protection using this design. The filtering effect test confirmed that the contamination of designated locations could be protected when using the mask with filters. As in the clinical safety test, a total of 18 participants (10 [55.6%] females; aged 33.1 ± 0.6 years) were included in the final analysis. There were no significant changes in SPO2, EtCO2, HR, SBP, DBP, and RR at the beginning, 20th, 40th, or 60th minutes of the test (all p >.05). The discomfort of wearing a mask increased slightly after time but remained within the tolerable range. The vision clarity score did not significantly change during the test. The mask also passed the breathability test. Conclusion: The results of our study showed that this mask performed adequately in the fit test, the filtering test, and the clinical safety test. The application of a full-face mask with antiviral properties, together with the newly designed shape of a respirator that respects the natural curves of a human face, will facilitate the production of personal protective equipment with a highly efficient filtration system. Methods: We conducted three independent tests in this validation study: (1) a fit test to calculate the particle number concentration and its association with potential leakage; (2) a filtering effect test to verify the mask’s ability to contain aerosol spread; and (3) a clinical safety test to examine the clinical safety, comfortableness, and visual clarity of the mask. © 2022, The Author(s).","Airway; COVID-19; Infection protection; Mask","3D printers; Aerosols; Protective clothing; Safety testing; Transmissions; Background aerosol; Face masks; Filtering effects; Full faces; Infection protection; Infectious disease; Inhalation therapy; Three-dimensional-printing; Transmission route; Validation study; adult; Article; breathing rate; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; end tidal carbon dioxide tension; female; filtration; heart rate; human; hyperbaric pressure; male; oxyhemoglobin saturation by pulse oximetry; particle size; polymerase chain reaction; pulse oximetry; respiratory tract infection; safety; scoring system; systolic blood pressure; vision clarity score; COVID-19","","","","","Ministry of Education, MOE; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (109-2327-B-006-008, MOST 109-2327-B-006-005, MOST 111-2321-B-006-009); Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST; National Cheng Kung University Hospital, NCKU, (NCKUH-11003016, NCKUH-11103042); National Cheng Kung University Hospital, NCKU; National Cheng Kung University, NCKU","Funding text 1: The authors appreciate the support of the Medical Device Innovation Center (MDIC) and National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) from the Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MoE) in Taiwan. ; Funding text 2: This study was supported by the Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST 109-2327-B-006-008, MOST 109-2327-B-006-005 and MOST 111-2321-B-006-009) and National Cheng Kung University Hospital (NCKUH-11003016 and NCKUH-11103042).

The temperature regime moved from several seconds, so called soak annealing, over spike annealing down to millisecond-annealing (Li in 13th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Thermal Processing of Semiconductors-RTP 2005). The reason for thermal budget reduction is not only in limiting diffusion while on the other hand achieving high activation. In this paper we will focus on the spike anneal thermal budget reduction by means of decreasing the time at 50 K below peak temperature. This time tT-50K is referred to as peak-width at T-50 K [Li in 13th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Thermal Processing of Semiconductors-RTP 2005, Zhao in ECS Trans 34(1):769–774 (2011)]. There are several possibilities to reduce peak-width of spike anneals. Wafer cooling through conduction and convection can be increased via addition of 1.5 slm Helium to N2 reducing the peak-width from > 2 s to 1.4 s for a 1090 °C spike anneal [Li in 13th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Thermal Processing of Semiconductors-RTP 2005, Zhao in ECS Trans 34(1):769–774 (2011)]. The method for reducing peak-width in this paper is the use of a high absorptive lamp field which leads to increased absorption of emitted wafer and lamp radiation. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]Thermal budget reduction in rapid thermal processing (RTP) has been a requirement since the beginning. In this paper we will focus on the spike anneal thermal budget reduction by means of decreasing the time at 50 K below peak temperature. This time tT-50 K is referred to as peak-width at T-50 K [Li in 13th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Thermal Processing of Semiconductors-RTP 2005, Zhao in ECS Trans 34(1):769–774 (2011)]. Wafer cooling through conduction and convection can be increased via addition of 1.5 slm Helium to N2 reducing the peak-width from > 2 s to 1.4 s for a 1090 °C spike anneal [Li in 13th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Thermal Processing of Semiconductors-RTP 2005, Zhao in ECS Trans 34(1):769–774 (2011)]. In this work we investigated the activation and diffusion behavior of a 3 keV, 2E15 cm−2 Boron implant which was annealed on both, a standard Helios®V RTP system and a Helios®V spike system with enhanced spike anneal sharpness. Peak temperatures investigated were 1050 °C and 1150 °C. Those two processes were compared with respect to activation and diffusion. In contrast to the standard Helios®V configuration, the tool with enhanced spike performance uses special temperature controller settings and a ‘high absorptive lamp field’. Sharper spike anneal temperature profiles originate from: (i) improved controller settings mainly influencing the ‘ramp-up slope’ and (ii) enhanced radiative wafer cooling after peak temperature due to increased absorption of the thermal radiation emitted from wafer and lamps. Since thermal radiation follows the Stefan-Boltzmann-Law and is proportional to ~ T4, the benefit from the ‘high absorptive lamp field’ is most pronounced at elevated temperatures. In (a) temperature profiles for 1050 & 1150 °C spike anneals are compared. For 1150 °C peak temperature, peak-width @ T-50 K can be reduced by 32%, from ~ 1.3 to ~ 0.9 s, while at 1050 °C peak temperature, peak-width is reduced by 25%, from 1.5 to 1.1 s (b). Due to smaller peak-width, sheet resistance is increased by 38% (b), whereas junction depth determined at a concentration of 1E19 cm−3 decreases by 10% at a peak temperature of 1050 °C (c). Despite the lower sensitivity of the implant at the higher process temperature of 1150 °C (b), sheet resistance is higher by 15% (b) and junction depth is smaller by 15% (c). Combining improved temperature controller parameters and a high absorptivity lamp field, the new Helios®V Spike system enhances spike anneal sharpness yielding 30% peak-width reduction and 15% junction depth reduction for the investigated B implant condition (3 keV, 2E15 cm−2). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Materials Research Society.","","Budget control; Helium; Rapid thermal annealing; Rapid thermal processing; Budget reductions; Conduction and convections; Junction depth; Peak temperatures; Peak widths; Rapid-thermal processing; Spike anneal; Thermal; Thermal budget; Wafer cooling; Silicon wafers","","","","","","","Li C., Et al., 13Th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Thermal Processing of Semiconductors-Rtp, (2005); Paul S., Lerch W., Mater.

College Madappally, Calicut University, Kerala, 673102, India","This paper discusses the novel features of DNA-templated one dimensional photonic crystals (1D PC) for additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing applications. AM applications utilize a variety of materials with tailored thermal, physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. However, the integration of optical properties into AM materials is less explored. AM parts produced from the materials having specific optical properties opens up many opportunities to develop novel integrated optoelectronic and photonic systems and provide sustainable structural color to the produced parts. This work proposes micro level periodic structures which can be used to replace existing color dyes for durable, non-toxic, cost-effective 3D printing applications. Based on ink jet printing technology, we designed DNA templated one dimensional (1D) photonic crystal (PC) of three-layer unit cell. The light transfer properties of the proposed 1D PC were examined theoretically in the range of 400 nm–800 nm of visible region of light using transfer matrix method (TMM). The photonic bandgap for DNA templated 1D PC is obtained around 450 nm and 650 nm of visible spectra region. The theoretical simulation shows that the presence of DNA template decreases the band gap width in the visible region and the three-layered periodic system helped to control the formation of multiple color bands in the visible region. The dispersion relation also confirmed that the electromagnetic fields in the stratified structure have been undergone multiple scattering and that results the formation of bandgap within the visible region. We also presented the standard deviation of the transmission coefficients in the range of 450 nm–650nm of visible spectra. Based on these observation and analysis, DNA templated PCs can be effective for tuning desired color spectra. Besides, this system can be used to replace the existing health hazardous synthetic dyes by incorporating with inkjet printing processes to create durable and colored 3D objects for aesthetic as well as technical purposes. © 2022 The Authors","3D printing; Additive manufacturing (AM); Dispersion; DNA; Photonic bandgap effect (PBG); Photonic crystal (PC); Transfer matrix method (TMM)","Additives; Bioinformatics; Color; Cost effectiveness; DNA; Electromagnetic fields; Energy gap; Microcomputers; Photonic band gap; Spontaneous emission; Transfer matrix method; Transmissions; 1-D photonic crystal; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Additive manufacturing; Photonic bandgap effect; Photonic crystal; Templated; Transfer matrix method; Transfer-matrix method; 3D printers","","","","","Erasmus + KA107 ICM, (IRLDUBLIN04); University Grants Commission, UGC; Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, (16/1571 RC/3872, 19/US-C2C/3579); Science Foundation Ireland, SFI; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","This work is financially supported by the UGC , New Delhi, India in the form of Junior Research Fellowship ( JRF ) and Senior Research Fellowship ( SRF ) and also this work is supported by Erasmus + KA107 ICM ( IRLDUBLIN04 ), and in part by a research grant from Science Foundation Ireland ( SFI ) under Grant Numbers 16/1571 RC/3872 , 19/US-C2C/3579 ; and European Regional Development Fund and by I-Form industry partners.","Mpofu T.P., Mawere C., Mukosera M., The Impact and Application of 3D Printing Technology, (2014); Ngo T.D., Kashani A., Imbalzano G., Nguyen K.T., Hui D., Additive manufacturing (3D printing): a review of materials, methods, applications and challenges, Compos.

After the heat treatment close to the β transus temperature (950 °C as used in this study), the tensile strength of the sample was ∼30% higher than that of as-cast TA15, accompanied by the obvious enhancement of ∼67% in elongation. The high strength originated mainly from the secondary α-phase and discontinuous grain boundary α-phase (GB-α), whereas the large ductility correlates to the complete decomposition of brittle α’ martensite. Discontinuous GB-α could inhibit crack initiation at the grain boundary and the fine secondary α-phase impeded the dislocation motion, which could enhance the tensile strength. Meanwhile, the α lath directions after heat treatments were far away from the 45° of the load direction, which also avoided the localized deformation within α laths and thus improved the fracture resistance of LPBF TA15. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Electron backscattered diffraction; Heat treatments; High-temperature tensile properties; Laser powder bed fusion; Ti–6.5Al–2Zr–1Mo–1V","Ductility; Grain boundaries; Heat treatment; High strength alloys; Electron back-scattered diffraction; Grain-boundaries; High temperature strength; High temperature tensile properties; High-temperature ductility; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; Strength and ductilities; Ti–6.5al–2zr–1mo–1v; Tensile strength","","","","","Sailing Program, (20YF1431600); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2021JJ40773); University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, USST","This research work was sponsored by Sailing Program ( 20YF1431600 ), internal funding from Univeristy of Shanghai for Science and Technology , and National Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province ( 2021JJ40773 ).

In the present work, two parametric frames, a newly hybrid three period minimal surface (TPMS) cellular structure and a Voronoi structure, are designed with high porosity ranging from 83% to 95% and fabricated by means of SLM using Mg alloy powders. The printing quality and the printing accuracy of all specimens are evaluated by SEM and GOM inspect suite 2020 respectively, and the mechanical properties are measured from the corresponding stress-strain responses under quasi-static compression test. Complementary, static 3D models are developed to simulate and analyze the mechanical properties of both structures using the finite element method. Experimental results show that all 3D printed specimens are identified with continuous connections and interconnected porous architectures, and the average deviations between designed models and printed specimens are within 5%. Meanwhile, the properties of both parametric structures are porosity dependent, and elastic moduli of 3D printed specimens are within the range of cancellous bones and can be adjusted easily through the design parameters. With such high porosity, both structures show low density in the range of 0.09 g/cm3 to 0.31 g/cm3 as well as high hardness around 100 HV. Meanwhile, hybrid TPMS structures display superior mechanical properties compared to Voronoi structures, which is mainly ascribed to the unique structure revealed from the simulation results. In summary, this study provides a new reference for the parametric design of additive manufactured Mg alloys with porous structures for potential biomedical applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Magnesium alloy; Mechanical property; Selective laser melting; Triply periodic minimal surface; Voronoi design","Additives; Biocompatibility; Compression testing; Medical applications; Porosity; Quality control; Scaffolds; Selective laser melting; Strain; Structural design; Structural properties; Biomedical applications; High porosity; Mg alloy; Minimal surfaces; Parametric design; Selective laser melting; Triply periodic minimal surfaces; Voronoi; Voronoi design; Voronoi structure; Magnesium alloys","","","","","Shanghai Engineering Research Center of High-Performance Medical Device Materials, (20DZ2255500); Shanghai Sailing Program, (19YF1434300); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (5220108 3)","The authors are grateful for the funding of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 5220108 3), Shanghai Sailing Program (No. 19YF1434300 ) and Shanghai Engineering Research Center of High-Performance Medical Device Materials (No. 20DZ2255500 ) and the assistance of Prof. Koichi kitazono and Prof. Hur boyoung during the course of this work.","Xu T., Yang Y., Peng X., Song J., Pan F., Overview of advancement and development trend on magnesium alloy, J.

AM can resolve the chronic discomfort of body-supporting devices felt by people, especially those that suffer from imprecise fits, inconvenience with adjustments required in these devices to fit the body, or limitation of body movements to normal operating ranges. To enhance the user experience of those who wear medical devices, elastomeric meshes with programmed “waves” can be additively produced to enable an adjustment of the tensile stiffness in small-strain and large-strain sections. In this study, we demonstrate a method by which to adjust the stiffness transition point from low small-strain stiffness to high large-strain stiffness of additively manufactured sinusoidal and semicircular elastic fibers and determine the key design factors for transition points. Mechanics model predicts the 1D tensile behavior and experiments with controlled mechanical testing verify the model. We reveal the major design factors that can induce the difference in the stiffness akin to on-off before and after transition. In addition, we produce meshes by the superposition of different wavy fibers, leading to multi-transition tensile behavior and thus expanding the area where mechanical properties can be controlled. An inverse design strategy is developed to improve the utility of an elastomeric mesh which enables the facile customization of the mesh with desired properties. Finally, we demonstrate that users can implement desired functions - not only the size but also the degree of body restriction - through proper settings by producing locally tailored wearable mesh-aid devices. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Body-supporting Device; Elastomeric Mesh; Inverse Design; Material-Extrusion Additive Manufacturing; Nonlinear Tensile Behavior","Additives; Extrusion; Fits and tolerances; Inverse problems; Mesh generation; Stiffness; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Body-supporting device; Design factors; Elastomeric mesh; Inverse designs; Large strains; Material-extrusion additive manufacturing; Medical Devices; Nonlinear tensile behavior; Tensile behaviors; Transition point; 3D printers","","","","","URP; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2018R1C1B5086570); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, KAIST","This work is supported by the 2019 Undergraduate Research Program ( URP ), by the 2021 Student Challenge Program for Advanced and Intellectualization in Manufacturing at KAIST , and by the National Research Foundation of Korea ( NRF ) grant funded by the Korea government ( MSIT ) [ 2018R1C1B5086570 ].","Javaid M., Haleem A., 3D printed tissue and organ using additive manufacturing: an overview, Clin.

Different from conventional single-target detection using a single sensor or multiple-target detection using multiple sensors, this study designs a novel multi-channel monocular vision sensor to monitor different geometrical sizes, i.e., current layer to nozzle distance, previous layer to nozzle distance, and layer width. A Marr-Hildreth algorithm is employed to extract boundaries of the molten pool and the previous layer. A homography matrix is solved for height calibration, and detected heights are introduced to assist layer width calibration. The sensor's accuracy is verified via variable-size templates, and the maximum errors of detected height and width are 3.39% and 3.98%, respectively. Finally, the sensor is applied to monitor the layer size of a 5th-layered wall. This study lays a solid foundation for high-precision control of multiple geometrical sizes in WAAM. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Calibration; Geometrical dimensions; Marr-Hildreth algorithm; Multi-channel monocular vision sensor; Wire and arc additive manufacturing","Additives; Calibration; Geometry; Nozzles; Vision; Geometrical dimensions; Geometrical sizes; Layer width; Marr-hildreth algorithm; Monocular vision; Multi channel; Multi-channel monocular vision sensor; Vision sensors; Visual sensor; Wire and arc additive manufacturing; 3D printers","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51975491, 62173280); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2682021ZTPY086); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China, no. 62173280 and no. 51975491, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, no. 2682021ZTPY086.","Min Y., Shen S., Li H., Liu S., Mi J., Zhou J., Chen J., Online monitoring of an additive manufacturing environment using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer, Measurement., 189, (2021); Sames W.J., List F.A., Pannala S., Dehoff R.R., Babu S.S., The metallurgy and processing science of metal additive manufacturing, Int.

A series of optimization techniques for adapting service loadings is developing as a design tool for components on the basis of lattices. These approaches must be tested in a controlled manner for acquiring trust. The development and advancement of Additive Manufacturing System (AMS) technology has enabled the manufacturing of unimaginable complex forms. Support structures, on the other hand, are necessary to create such complex geometries. Apart from wasting unnecessary material, post processing times and valuable production are consumed by these structures. The focus of this paper is to analyze the effect of a “new hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm” for optimizing the lattice structure for AMS. The proposed optimization algorithm optimizes the lattice structure by eliminating the maximum number of vertices and filling the required “inner and outer areas”, so as to ensure that the entire “areas to support are still sustained”. The hybridization of two algorithms like “Chicken Swarm Optimization (CSO), and Beetle Swarm Optimization (BSO) referred as Hybrid Beetle-Chicken Swarm Optimization (HBCSO)” is adopted for pruning the structure. The proposed hybrid algorithm attempts to identify the type of “sublattice of the initial lattice structure that has the smallest cumulated vertices” and satisfies the sustainment constraint. The validation of the suggested optimization is performed on various test cases and compares it over the traditional models to prove the efficiency of the introduced model in consuming less material for manufacturing lattice structure. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Additive manufacturing system; Beetle swarm optimization; Chicken swarm optimization; Hybrid Beetle-Chicken swarm optimization; Lattice structure optimization","Additives; Animals; Heuristic algorithms; Shape optimization; Structural optimization; Additive manufacturing system; Beetle swarm optimization; Chicken swarm optimization; Hybrid beetle-chicken swarm optimization; Lattice structure optimization; Lattice structures; Structure optimization; Swarm optimization; 3D printers","","","","","","","Tofail S.A.M., Koumoulos E.P., Bandyopadhyay A., Bose S., O'Donoghue L., Charitidis C., Additive manufacturing: scientific and technological challenges, market uptake and opportunities, Mater.

Detonation nanodiamond (ND) has shown its potential to improve the mechanical and biological properties of such hydrogels. Enhancing the performance properties of natural biopolymer gelatin-based hydrogels can widen their biomedical application possibilities to various areas including drug delivery, tissue engineering and 3D bioprinting. Method: In this study, natural cross-linker tannic acid (TA) is used along with ferrous sulphate (FS) to optimize the swelling and disintegration of extrudable and 3D printable gelatin hydrogels. The amounts of TA and FS are restricted to improve the extrusion ability of the gels in 3D printing. Further, ND particles (detonation type) are dispersed using twin screw extrusion technology to study their effect on mechanical and biological properties of the 3D printing hydrogel. Results: The improved dispersion of ND particles helps to improve compressive strength almost ten times and dynamic modulus three times using 40 mg ND (2% w/w of gelatin). The surface-functional groups of detonation ND also contributed for such improvement in mechanical properties due to higher interaction with the hydrogel matrix. The stability of the hydrogels in water was also improved to 7 days. Four times improvement of the cell growth and proliferation was observed in ND based hydrogel. Conclusion: The cell-supportive nature of these moderately stable and extrudable ND dispersed gelatin hydrogels makes them a good candidate for short term regenerative applications of cell-encapsulated injectable hydrogels with better mechanical properties. © 2022, The Author(s).","Ferrous sulphate; Gelatin; Hydrogel; Nanodiamond; Tannic acid","ferrous sulfate; gelatin; hydrogel; nanodiamond; tannin; adult; Article; cell growth; cell viability; compressive strength; controlled study; drug delivery system; drug stability; human; in vitro study; MC3T3 cell line; particle size; scanning electron microscopy; surface property; three dimensional bioprinting; tissue engineering; zeta potential","","ferrous sulfate, 10028-21-4, 10124-49-9, 13463-43-9, 7720-78-7, 7782-63-0, 17375-41-6, 20908-72-9; gelatin, 9000-70-8; tannin, 1401-55-4","","","Ministry of Environment, MOE; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (2021H1D3A2A02044451, NRF-2022R1A2C2006341); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","Authors are grateful for the support provided by National Research Foundation of Korea (Brain Pool Fellowship 2021H1D3A2A02044451 and NRF-2022R1A2C2006341), the Human Resource Development Programs for Green Convergence Technology funded by the Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE), and PSG Institutions to conduct the research.

To fight against COVID-19, we propose a novel autonomous decision-making process which combines two modules in order to support the decision-maker: (1) Bayesian Networks method–based data-analysis module, which is used to specify the severity of coronavirus symptoms and classify cases as mild, moderate, and severe, and (2) autonomous decision-making module–based association rules mining method. This method allows the autonomous generation of the adequate decision based on the FP-growth algorithm and the distance between objects. To build the Bayesian Network model, we propose a novel data–based method that enables to effectively learn the network’s structure, namely, MIGT-SL algorithm. The experimentations are performed over pre-processed discrete dataset. The proposed algorithm allows to correctly generate 74%, 87.5%, and 100% of the original structure of ALARM, ASIA, and CANCER networks. The proposed Bayesian model performs well in terms of accuracy with 96.15% and 94.77%, respectively, for binary and multi-class classification. The developed decision-making model is evaluated according to its utility in solving the decisional problem, and its accuracy of proposing the adequate decision is about 97.80%.

In this work, the deposited Ni3Al-based alloy was oxidized at 1100 °C for different times to investigate the high-temperature oxidation difference caused by RB. The differences in the microstructure, grain orientation, oxidation behavior, and oxidation mechanism between RB and non-RB were systematically studied. The results showed that these RB, epitaxially grown on the non-RB during each deposition layer, displayed similar Goss textures but a higher proportion of γ + γ′ dual-phase microstructure compared to non-RB. The oxidation of the deposited Ni3Al-based alloy obeyed parabolic growth kinetics at 1100 °C for 10 h and the oxidation scales were consisted of external NiO layer, intermediate NiAl2O4 layer with dispersed Al2O3 and TiO2 particles and internal Al2O3 layer. The outward diffusion of Al and Ti elements during the oxidation process led to the decomposition of γ′ precipitations and the formation of γ′-reduced layer beneath the Al2O3 layer. The cross-section microstructure of oxidation scales indicated that the RB displayed thicker scales and poorer oxidation resistance than non-RB. The oxidation rate of the deposited Ni3Al-based alloy was controlled by the outward transport rate of the total cations (Ni2+, Al3+, and Ti4+) through the Al2O3 layer. Initial oxidation and diffusion interface analysis demonstrated that the γ + γ′ dual-phase had a higher outward transport rate of the cations, which was responsible for the thicker oxide scales on the RB. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Ni<sub>3</sub>Al-based alloy; Oxidation; Remelting","3D printers; Additives; Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Nickel oxide; Oxidation resistance; Positive ions; Reaction intermediates; Textures; Thermooxidation; Titanium dioxide; Epitaxially grown; Grain orientation; High temperature oxidation Behavior; Microstructural characteristics; Ni3al-based alloy; Non-uniform; Oxidation behaviours; Oxidation mechanisms; Oxidation scale; Transport rate; Alloys","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52174369); Tianjin Science and Technology Program, (19ZXJRGX00100)","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52174369 ), and the Science and Technology Program of Tianjin (Grant No. 19ZXJRGX00100 ).","Jozwik P., Polkowski W., Bojar Z., Applications of Ni3Al based intermetallic alloys-current stage and potential perceptivities, Materials, 8, pp. 2537-2568, (2015); Liu H., Xu M.M., Li S., Bao Z.B., Zhu S.L., Wang F.H., Improving cyclic oxidation resistance of Ni3Al-based single crystal superalloy with low-diffusion platinum-modified aluminide coating, J Mater Sci Technol, 54, pp. 132-143, (2020); Wu J., Li C., Wu Y., Huang Y., Xia X., Liu Y., Creep behaviors of multiphase Ni3Al-based intermetallic alloy after 1000 °C-1000 h long-term aging at intermediate temperatures, Mater.

GWs can be viable in every aspect of sustainability; they provide residents of buildings with a wide range of economic, social and environmental benefits. Despite this, the adoption rate of GW is still in its infancy stage, and the existing literature concerning the hindrances inhibiting GW adoption is very limited. To address these gaps, the aim of this paper is to identify and prioritize the hindrances to GW adoption in Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach: After identifying 17 hindrances through an in-depth review of literature, the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) is employed to refine the hindrances based on the local context with the help of 21 qualified experts in the field. Subsequently, Fuzzy Parsimonious Analytic Hierarchy Process (FPAHP) is exploited as a recently developed technique to prioritize the identified hindrances. Findings: Results reveal that the most significant hindrances to the adoption of GW are maintenance cost, high installation cost, difficulties in maintenance, sophisticated implementation and inducement to fire. Findings call for scholars to address ways to improve GW installation practices and methods in order to eradicate the hindrances and provide lessons for policymakers, assisting them in facilitating the larger-scale adoption of GW. Originality/value: Considering the dearth of studies on hindrances to the adoption of GWs, this paper provides a comprehensive outlook of the issue, providing knowledge that can be used as a building block for future scholars within the field. It also provides valuable insights for stakeholders within the construction industry about the hindrances to the adoption of GWs which could direct their efforts toward better implementation of it. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Design; Fuzzy sets; Green building; MCDM methods; Sustainability","Architectural design; Construction industry; Costs; Product design; Walls (structural partitions); Design/methodology/approach; Economic benefits; Environmental benefits; Environmentally friendly products; Fuzzy Delphi Method; Green buildings; Hong-kong; MCDM method; Social and environmental; Social benefits; Sustainable development","","","","","ANZAScA; Architectural Science Association; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, UTM","The first author is a researcher of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under the Post-Doctoral Fellowship Scheme.

It has a relative good resultant mechanical properties among ceramics, and it also can be provided with the beautiful colors blending the additives to reach the best artistic effect. This work mixed the colorful ZrO2 ceramic pastes with Co3O4, Cr2O3 and Er2O3, respectively, formed the colorful ZrO2 ceramic parts by SLA-3D printing technology, and then sintered the colorful ZrO2 ceramic parts at high temperature. The coloring mechanism of colorful ZrO2 ceramic parts was investigated and the optimum printing process was obtained. The results indicated that when the cobalt oxide contents is not exceed 5 wt%, the color of zirconia ceramic parts can be changed enough. The coloring quality of blue zirconia ceramics was mainly dominated by the forming of oxides of Al, Co and O elements. The final coloring quality of zirconia ceramics with chromium oxide was mainly determined by the forming of a solid solution containing Al, Cr and O elements. Finally, the pink, green and blue colorful school emblems of Shandong University with complex shapes were prepared successfully, which verifies the feasibility of our proposed scheme of esthetic decoration material preparation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Colorful Zirconia ceramic; Coloring mechanism; Esthetic decoration; Stereolithography","3D printers; Blending; Chromium compounds; Cobalt compounds; Erbium compounds; Zirconia; 3-D printing; Artistic effects; Ceramic parts; Ceramic pastes; Color-blending; Colorful zirconium ceramic; Coloring mechanism; Esthetic decoration; O elements; Zirconia ceramic; Additives","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52175336); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, (ZR2020ZD05); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province","This project was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 52175336 ] and Shandong Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number ZR2020ZD05 ].","Kelly J.R., Denry I., Stabilized zirconia as a structural ceramic: an overview, Dent.

This is because conventional polymer 3D printers, which are low cost and readily available, can easily be adapted for use with metal powder-filled polymer filaments. However, fabricating the latter is time-consuming and their formulations differ from regular metal injection molding (MIM) feedstocks by lower powder solids loadings and higher elastomer contents, thus requiring significant efforts to optimize their debinding and sintering conditions. Favorably, other types of MEAM-HP printers, such as screw- and piston-based ones, can process available MIM feedstocks and apply the debinding and sintering procedures that have already been optimized. In this study, a novel ram extruder-based printer with a 100 mm-diameter ― 250 mm-high build volume was developed to print a low-viscosity MIM feedstock composed of 65% of 17–4PH powder, 23 % of paraffin wax, 10% of ethylene vinyl acetate and 2 % of stearic acid (all in vol%). The printer calibration and the process optimization procedures are detailed herein. The kinematic accuracy of the build platform revealed a maximum deviation of 29 and 92 µm in the vertical (Z) and horizontal (XY) directions, respectively. Prior to printing, a relative feedstock density of 99.8 % was obtained using a one-minute degassing procedure. During printing, a 52.5 °C build platform temperature was used and an 85 °C extrusion temperature conferred to the feedstock a viscosity of 142 Pa·s at a shear strain rate of 180 s-1 (Ø0.4 mm E3D V6 nozzle, 1 mm3/s flow rate). Indirect measurements of the extrusion pressure using a load cell positioned under the piston allowed to maximize the accuracy of start/stop extrusion sequences by adjusting the retraction volumes. An overlap printing path technique was introduced to eliminate typical MEAM voids between printed lines. Finally, six parts exhibiting complex geometries were printed to validate the capacity of the printer to produce functional components using conventional low-viscosity MIM feedstocks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D-printing; Additive manufacturing; Binder; Feedstock; Material extrusion additive manufacturing with highly-filled polymers (MEAM-HP); Metallic powder","Additives; Ethylene; Extrusion; Feedstocks; Injection molding; Metal molding; Metals; MIM devices; Optimization; Powder metals; Printing presses; Shear deformation; Shear flow; Sintering; Strain rate; Viscosity; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Debinding; Highly filled polymers; Low viscosity; Material extrusion additive manufacturing with highly-filled polymer; Metal injection molding; Metallic powder; Metallics; Performance; 3D printers","","","","","Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologies, FRQNT; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (RGPIN-2018–04407)","Funding text 1: This work was carried out with the financial support of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Grant RGPIN-2018\u201304407) and the financial support of the FRQNT Master's research scholarship.; Funding text 2: This work was carried out with the financial support of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Grant RGPIN-2018\u201304407 ) and the financial support of the FRQNT Master\u2019s research scholarship .","(2015); I.A. 52900:2021, Additive manufacturing — General principles — Fundamentals and vocabulary, (2021); Jiang J., Zhong R., Newman S., A review of multiple degrees of freedom for additive manufacturing machines, Int.

For this, the LPBF-fabricated alloy was deformed by rotary swaging up to a true strain of 2.5 following a laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process. Compared to the LPBF condition, swaging results in a refinement of the microstructure by one order of magnitude and an increased hardness and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) which is mainly attributed to the finer microstructure of the swaged alloy. By annealing, a higher peak-aging hardness of (209 ± 2) HV0.1 and UTS of (717 ± 2) MPa of the swaged alloy at a lower peak-aging temperature of 300 °C (1 h) was obtained. Significant improvement of uniform elongation by enhanced work hardening capability of the swaged and annealed alloy is obtained for annealing temperatures above 300 °C while strength is only moderately affected. The significant improvement of aging kinetics is discussed alongside a profound microstructural characterization of the heterogeneous grain structure and precipitate distribution. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Cold working; High-strength Al alloy; Laser powder bed fusion; Mechanical properties; Precipitation strengthening","Additives; Age hardening; Aluminum alloys; Annealing; Ductility; Hardness; High strength alloys; Magnesium alloys; Manganese alloys; Microstructure; Precipitation (chemical); Scandium alloys; Strain hardening; Tensile strength; Al-alloy; Hardening capability; High-strength; High-strength al alloy; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Peak aging; Powder bed; Precipitation strengthening; Ultimate tensile strength; Cold working","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (IH130100008); Australian Research Council, ARC; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Australian Research Council grant number IH130100008 “Industrial Transformation Research Hub for Transforming Australia's Manufacturing Industry through High Value Additive Manufacturing”.

However, the manipulation and control of the in-situ metallurgy quality is one of the most critical challenges it faced now, as insufficient metallurgy not only causes inherent defects but also leads to fatal damages to the deposited component. Till now, there is almost no effective way to manipulate it. In this study, we proposed to use the alternating dual-electron beam to flexibly control the molten pool, thereby, achieving the purpose of manipulating the in-situ metallurgical process. Ti-22Al-25 Nb (at%) alloy was taken as the target alloy and fabricated in-situ with the raw materials of pre-alloyed TiNb wire and pure-Al wire. Results show that this technology not only exhibits powerful control ability to the molten pool characteristics but also brings additional in-situ co-frequency forced vibration behavior to the molten pool. The regulated elongated molten pool, as well as its vibration behavior further promotes composition homogenization, porosity reduction(densification as high as 99.999%), and grain refinement(about 32%). As a result, the tensile strength of the in-situ deposited components is as high as 993.6 ± 32.4 MPa on average. In addition, employing an alternating heat source model, numerical simulation was also carried out for revealing the unique temperature evolution and molten pool flow mechanism of the alternating dual-beam AM technology. This work not only provides valuable guidance for the regulation of the in-situ metallurgy quality in the wired-based in-situ AM field but also supplies an unprecedented processing method for the Ti-22Al-25 Nb alloy. © 2022","Dual-electron beam freeform fabrication; Grain refinement; In-situ additive manufacturing; Molten pool controlling; Ti-22Al-25 Nb alloy","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Electron beams; Fabrication; Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; Metals; Niobium alloys; Quality control; Tensile strength; Titanium alloys; Wire; Dual-electron beam freeform fabrication; Electron beam freeform fabrication; Electron-beam; Grains refinement; In-situ additive manufacturing; In-situ metallurgies; Molten pool; Molten pool controling; Nb alloys; Ti-22al-25 nb alloy; 3D printers","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51875309); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation, (3222008); Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation","The work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51875309 ) and the Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation (CN) ( 3222008 ).

The algorithm uses a finite-element model of the AM process to determine a sequence of laser powers (i.e., laser power as a function of time) that will result in the least variation in molten pool temperature. The algorithm was applied to a single-layer DED process made up of 36 unidirectional passes. The build material was Inconel® 625. A 15.1 °K (23.5%) reduction in standard deviation of molten pool temperature was achieved, and the upward trend of molten pool temperatures toward the later stages of the process was considerably reduced. Cooling rate was reduced by up to 67 °K/s (10.8%) at certain locations, although these improvements appeared largely at the later stages of the process. Another model was developed to facilitate comparison between the optimization algorithm and in situ feedback control. In this model, laser power was allowed to change in 5% increments whenever molten pool temperature dropped below 105% or rose above 120% of Inconel® 625’s melting temperature. This simulated control model yielded a 26.05 °K (44.1%) reduction in standard deviation of molten pool temperature and was able to reduce cooling rates across the entire print geometry by up to 86 °K/s (11.4%). These results indicate that the optimization algorithm can be used to achieve improved results in DED processes without the need for in situ interference. The algorithm may yield greater benefits during longer build times. In situ feedback control, if available, is still expected to perform best. © 2022, Crown.","Additive manufacturing; Cooling rate; Directed energy deposition; Molten pool; Optimization","","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","The authors acknowledge financial support from the National Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC).

The number of patients with permanent vision loss due to glaucoma is expected to increase at an alarming rate in the near future. A considerable amount of research is being conducted on computer-aided diagnosis for glaucoma. Segmentation of the optic cup (OC) and optic disc (OD) is usually performed to distinguish glaucomatous and non-glaucomatous cases in retinal fundus images. However, the OC boundaries are quite non-distinctive; consequently, the accurate segmentation of the OC is substantially challenging, and the OD segmentation performance also needs to be improved. To overcome this problem, we propose two networks, separable linked segmentation network (SLS-Net) and separable linked segmentation residual network (SLSR-Net), for accurate pixel-wise segmentation of the OC and OD. In SLS-Net and SLSR-Net, a large final feature map can be maintained in our networks, which enhances the OC and OD segmentation performance by minimizing the spatial information loss. SLSR-Net employs external residual connections for feature empowerment. Both proposed networks comprise a separable convolutional link to enhance computational efficiency and reduce the cost of network. Even with a few trainable parameters, the proposed architecture is capable of providing high segmentation accuracy. The segmentation performances of the proposed networks were evaluated on four publicly available retinal fundus image datasets: Drishti-GS, REFUGE, Rim-One-r3, and Drions-DB which confirmed that our networks outperformed the state-of-the-art segmentation architectures. © 2022 The Author(s)","Artificial intelligence;

However, previous works failed to realize a full quantitative analytical modeling of the DF in HVMPD-DIW as they ignored the changes in cross-sectional shape and lacked prediction of height. Herein, an improved analytical model is proposed for DF in HVMPD-DIW considering both the changes in cross-sectional shape and height prediction. This study could predict flow rate, deposition statuses, and width and height of DF. To fulfill this objective, first, an analytical model of flow rate is described to predict the flow rate of DF in time domain. Secondly, three deposition statuses are summarized and analytical dividing lines are derived to determine deposition statuses based on the dimensionless nozzle velocity and the dimensionless height. Thirdly, width and height of DF are predicted based on the determined deposition statuses. Finally, Nivea Crème is selected as the high viscosity material reference and flow rate, and filaments deposition experiments are conducted to validate the proposed model experimentally. The effectiveness and prediction accuracy of the proposed model are validated as the relative errors between analytical and experimental results are less than 4.31% and 3.90% for flow rate and cross-sectional dimensions (width and height), respectively. The current work demonstrates an effective and accurate approach for analytical prediction of flow rate, deposition statuses, and width and height of DF in HVMPD-DIW. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Analytical modeling; Deposited filaments; Direct ink writing; High viscosity material; Piston-driven","Analytical models; Deposition; Flow rate; Forecasting; Time domain analysis; Viscosity; Analytical modeling; Cross-sectional shape; Deposited filament; Direct ink writing; High viscosities; High viscosity material; Manufacturing techniques; Material-based; Piston-driven; Time domain; Pistons","","","","","China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201906020135)","This work has been supported by the China Scholarship Council (No. 201906020135).

However, uncured thermoset composites become unstable as print height increases. Here, chemical initiation of vinyl ester immediately before deposition was used to suppress collapse and enable large-scale thermoset printing. Structural stability was assessed by printing thin walls at various layer times and monitoring thermal gradients with an infrared camera. Stable printing was observed at a layer time of 4.50 min, approximately half the gel time of the material (8 min). Self-weight collapse occurred at short layer time (0.68 min), whereas warpage occurred at long layer time (6.50 min). A new behavior was discovered at intermediate layer time (2.25 min) where the heat generated by the reaction causes new, un-gelled layers to flow. Forced convection eliminates this behavior, stabilizing the 2.25-min layer time print. These findings motivated development of a less exothermic material system, which was used to print a large-scale mold and demonstrate the value of this understanding. By presenting these challenges of large-scale reactive thermoset AM for the first time, this work motivates focused studies of the complex interplay between rheological, thermal, and chemical behaviors to improve the feasibility of large-scale thermoset AM. Tensile properties of the printed material were also measured. Longitudinal and transverse elastic moduli are 3.79 and 2.95 GPa, respectively, and corresponding tensile strengths are 36.11 and 18.83 MPa. The glass transition temperature is 93.13 °C. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Additive manufacturing; Chemical initiation; Heat generation; Large scale; Self-weight stability; Thermoset","3D printers; Additives; Chemical stability; Glass transition; Reaction intermediates; Shrinkage; Tensile strength; Chemical initiation; Cure shrinkage; Large-scales; Self-weight; Self-weight stability; Structural stabilities; Temperature evolution; Thermoset composites; Thin walls; Vinyl esters; Thermosets","","","","","Magnum Venus Products Inc.; ORNL’s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility; Polynt-Reichold Inc.; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; University of Tennessee, UT","Funding text 1: The authors are pleased to acknowledge the collaboration with Magnum Venus Products Inc. in production of the thermoset printer.

The use of AM in composites production has also become quite popular to leverage these benefits and produce products with customized properties. In this context, thermoplastic materials are widely used in the development of plastic-based composites due to their affordability and availability. In this work, composite plastic manufacturing (CPM) has been used to manufacture plastic-based composites with bespoke properties in a cost- and time-effective manner. Various plastic-based composites have been manufactured using CPM by interlacing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) with thermally activated materials. Three different thermally activated materials (graphene–carbon hybrid paste, heat cure epoxy, and graphene epoxy paste) have been used in this work to produce plastic-based composites. Thermally activated materials that are commercially available include graphene–carbon hybrid paste and heat cure epoxy. The graphene epoxy paste was a concoction made by incorporating three different weight percentages of graphene nanoplatelets (0.2 wt.%, 0.4 wt.%, and 0.6 wt.%) with heat cure epoxy. The composites were manufactured with multiple layers of thermally activated materials at different intervals to investigate their effect. The parts were manufactured and tested according to British and international standards. Experimental tests of mass, dimensions, ultrasonics, tensile strength, hardness, and flexural strength were conducted to evaluate the properties of composites manufactured by CPM. The parts manufactured by CPM showed superior mechanical properties compared to commercially available ABS. The increase was shown to be in the range of 8.1% to 33% for tensile strength, 17.8% to 30.2% for hardness, and 6.2% to 24.4% for flexural strength, based on the composite configurations. The results demonstrate that the CPM process can produce high-quality plastic composites and can be used to create products with customized properties in a time-effective manner. © 2022 by the authors.","ABS plastic; additive manufacturing; composite plastic manufacturing; flexural test; hardness; plastic-based composites; tensile test; thermally activated materials; thermoplastics; ultrasonic test","","","","","","Transporter Engineering Limited; Anglia Ruskin University; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","This research was funded by European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), as part of the KEEP+ Programme (KEEP+ ref: 635) between Anglia Ruskin University and Transporter Engineering Limited.","Salifu S., Desai D., Ogunbiyi O., Mwale K., Recent development in the additive manufacturing of polymer-based composites for automotive structures—A review, Int.

Shape memory alloy (SMA) is most commonly used material for 4D printing. However, metal-based SMAs exhibit lower recovered strain during 4D printing compared to shape memory polymers, thereby requiring enhanced recovery in metal-based SMAs. In this study, a novel two-functional Cu-Al-Ni SMA consisting of two separate structures fabricated by powder bed fusion process was investigated to enhance the recovery in SMAs. The binding morphology of the two structures and subsequent consequences on the 4D printing behavior were analyzed. The first structure recovered at a lower temperature, whereas the second structure recovered at a higher temperature. In the case of the two-functional material, the difference in the hardness values and recovery temperature favored the recovery ratio due to the damping behavior of the harder structure and the generation of a temperature gradient across the deformation section. Additionally, the higher residual stresses obtained in the harder structure by simulation proved the mismatch between the two structures, leading to resistance against plastic deformation. Meanwhile, the formation of secondary martensite plates was observed in the second structure of the two-functional material. These secondary martensite plates enhanced the overall recovery by (i) the attenuation of thermal conductivity across the deformation section and generation of the temperature gradient, and (ii) the increase in residual stresses and mismatch between the two joined structures. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","4D printing; Cu-Al-Ni alloy; Powder bed fusion; Shape memory alloy; Two-functional material","3D printers; Aluminum alloys; Copper alloys; Functional materials; Martensite; Melting; Plates (structural components); Powder metals; Residual stresses; Shape-memory alloy; Ternary alloys; Thermal conductivity; Thermal gradients; Titanium alloys; 4d printing; Cu-Al-Ni shape memory; Fusion process; Hard structure; Martensite plates; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion; Printing behavior; Shape memory polymers; Two-functional material; Nickel alloys","","","","","National Research Facilities and Equipment Center; Ministry of Education, MOE, (2021R1A6C101A449); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2019R1A5A6099595); Korea Basic Science Institute, KBSI; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work was supported by the Korea Basic Science Institute (National Research Facilities and Equipment Center) grant funded by the Ministry of Education (grant no. 2021R1A6C101A449 ), and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (No. 2019R1A5A6099595 ).","Reddy S., Smart materials for 4D printing: a review on developments, challenges and applications, Recent Advances in Manufacturing, Automation, Design and Energy Technologies.

However, limited by the electrolyte bath size, EPP method is not suitable for polishing workpieces with large size. This paper introduces a spray electrolyte plasma polishing (SEPP) method that can process large-scale and complex surface. The theoretical mechanism of SEPP is presented. GH3536 superalloy plates manufactured by SLM were used as the experimental specimens. The influence of cathode feed velocity on surface roughness is studied. Key parameters, like distance between anode and cathode, voltage, temperature, and flow rate of the electrolyte were investigated experimentally. Properties such as surface roughness, micro morphology, chemical composition, and surface hardness of the GH3536 specimens were detected and analyzed. The results show that SEPP technology can decrease the specimen surface roughness from Ra = 13.93 μm to 0.107 μm and obtain a smooth and glossy surface without obvious machining traces. The oxides and other impurities on the specimen surface were removed, and the contents of Ni, Cr, and Fe elements were increased. Additionally, the surface hardness values of the polished specimen were increased and showed good consistency. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Key parameters;

Although propane has high flammability, it is still considered a promising alternative because of its low global warming potential (GWP), high performance, and less charge mass. The impacts of VPI technology, ambient temperature, waste heat recovery power, compressor speed, indoor inlet air flow rate, and charge mass on the heat pump system performance have been experimentally studied. In addition, the heating performance and driving range improvement of different heat pump systems were compared. The results show that at −20 °C ambient temperature, the propane SL + VPI system was second only to CO2 direct heat pump system; its heating performance was 33.3–37.4 % greater than the propane direct heat pump. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicle; Heat pump; Propane; Secondary loop; Vapor injection","Electric vehicles; Global warming; Heat pump systems; Pumps; Refrigerants; Temperature; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Colder climate; Driving range; Environmentally-friendly refrigerants; Heat pumps; Heat-pump systems; Heating performance; Injection technology; Secondary loops; Vapor injection; Vehicle applications; Propane","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51877138); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFB0104400); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2018YFB0104400 ), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51877138 ).","Yoon S., Seung A., Sung K., Performance characteristics of PTC elements for an electric vehicle heating system, Energies, 9, (2016); Lee H., Lee D., Kim Y., Heating performance of a coolant-source heat pump using waste heat from stack and electric devices in fuel cell electric vehicles under cold conditions, Energy Convers.

The use of S-EMG is interesting because it allows accessing the muscular structure and function through the use of a noninvasive technique. This is a subject of interest to many areas of science such as clinical and orthopedic medicine, biomechanics, physiotherapy and rehabilitation, telemedicine, control of interfaces, intelligent prosthetics, and exoskeletons control and for expert systems to support medical diagnosis to neuromuscular diseases. Changes in the spectral signature of the S-EMG signal such as spectral shift for low frequencies and the increase in the dynamic range of the signal indicate the installation of the biological phenomenon of fatigue. For instance, classical techniques such as zero-crossing, median frequency (MDF), and mean power frequency (MPF) are able to perceive the spectral shift in S-EMG signals. On the other hand, techniques such as root mean square (RMS) values can only perceive the variation in the dynamic range of the S-EMG signal. Methods: In this work, new mathematical models for the objective assessment of muscle fatigue are presented. We sought to design models for objective fatigue estimators that simultaneously perceive the spectral shift for low frequencies and the increase in the dynamic range in the S-EMG signal during the instauration of the fatigue process. The new approach is integrated to the weighted-cumulated methodology framework previously proposed. Three new objective muscle fatigue estimators were conceived: the scalable weighted-cumulated Fourier estimator, the weighted-cumulated wavelet estimator (SWCW), and the weighted-cumulated p-side lobe attenuation algorithm (p-SL). Results: To evaluate the proposed tools based on the scalable weighted-cumulated methodology, we investigated two dynamic protocols with muscle fatigue production. The S-EMG signals recorded from the biceps brachii and from the vastus lateralis were used. The results obtained with the application of the new proposed objective fatigue estimators are shown.

We developed a new design for patient specific coronary phantoms, which allow adjustable physiological variables such as coronary distal resistance and coronary compliance in patients with coronary artery disease. The new design was tested in precise benchtop experiments and compared with a theoretical Windkessel electrical circuit equivalent, that models coronary flow and pressure using arterial resistance and compliance. Methods: Five phantoms from patients who underwent clinically indicated elective invasive coronary angiography were built from CCTA scans using multi-material 3D printing. Each phantom was used in a controlled flow system where patient specific flow conditions were simulated by a programmable cardiac pump. To simulate the arteriole and capillary beds flow resistance and the compliance for various physical activities, we designed a three-chamber outlet system which controls the outflow dynamics of each coronary tree. Benchtop pressure measurements were recorded using sensors embedded in each of the main coronary arteries. Using the Windkessel model, patient specific flow equivalent electrical circuit models were designed for each coronary tree branch, and flow in each artery was determined for known inflow conditions. Local flow resistances were calculated through Poiseuille’s Law derived from the radii and lengths of the coronary arteries using CT angiography based multi-planar reconstructions. The coronary stenosis flow rates from the benchtop and the electrical models were compared to the localized flow rates calculated from invasive pressure measurements recorded in the angio-suites. Results: The average Pearson correlations of the localized flow rates at the location of the stenosis between each of the models (Benchtop/Electrical, Benchtop/Angio, Electrical/Angio) are 0.970, 0.981, and 0.958 respectively. Conclusions: 3D printed coronary phantoms can be used to replicate the human arterial anatomy as well as blood flow conditions. It displays high levels of correlation when compared to hemodynamics calculated in electrically-equivalent coronary Windkessel models as well as invasive angio-suite pressure measurements. © 2022, The Author(s).","3D Printing; Coronary Artery Disease; Coronary CTA; Windkessel model","3D printers; Cell proliferation; Computerized tomography; Diseases; Equivalent circuits; Flow rate; Heart; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Coronary artery disease; Coronary CTA; Coronary flow; Patient specific; Phantoms; Physical activity; Windkessel; Windkessel models; arteriole; Article; blood vessel calcification; capillary; comparative study; computed tomographic angiography; coronary angiography; coronary artery blood flow; coronary artery disease; coronary artery obstruction; human; image reconstruction; measurement; physical activity; pressure measurement; stereolithography; theoretical model; three dimensional printing; turbulent flow; vascularization; Phantoms","","","Aquilion ONE, Canon, United States","Canon, United States","","","Schubert C., Van Langeveld M.C., Donoso L.A., Innovations in 3D printing: a 3D overview from optics to organs, Br J Ophthalmol, 98, 2, pp. 159-161, (2014); Barnatt C., 3D printing third edition.

One factor hindering the clinical utility of anatomically accurate 3D printed molds is that cured bone cement can be difficult to remove due to the strong adhesion between the mold and the bone cement. One way to reduce the adhesion between the 3D printed mold and the cured bone cement is with the use of a surface coating, such as a lubricant. This study sought to determine the optimal surface coating to prevent bone cement adhesion to 3D printed molds that could be utilized within a sterile operating room environment. Methods: Hemispheric molds were 3D printed using a stereolithography printer. The molds were coated with four sterile surface coatings available in most operating theatres (light mineral oil, bacitracin ointment, lubricating jelly, and ultrasound transmission gel). Polymethyl methacrylate with tobramycin antibiotic was mixed and poured into the molds. The amount of force needed to “push out” the cured bone cement from the molds was measured to determine the efficacy of each surface coating. Tukey’s multiple comparison test was performed to compare the results of the pushout test. Results: The average pushout force for the surface coatings, in increasing order, were as follows (mean ± standard deviation) --- bacitracin ointment: 9.10 ± 6.68 N, mineral oil: 104.93 ± 69.92 N, lubricating jelly: 147.76 ± 63.77 N, control group: 339.31 ± 305.20 N, ultrasound transmission gel 474.11 ± 94.77 N. Only the bacitracin ointment required significantly less pushout force than the control (p = 0.0123). Conclusions: The bacitracin ointment was the most effective surface coating, allowing the bone cement to be pushed out of the mold using the least amount of force. In addition, the low standard deviation speaks to the reliability of the bacitracin ointment to reduce mold adhesion compared to the other surface coatings. Given its efficacy as well as its ubiquitous presence in the hospital operating room setting, bacitracin ointment is an excellent choice to prevent adhesion between bone cement and 3D printed molds intraoperatively. © 2022, The Author(s).","3D printing; Bone cement; Orthopaedic surgery; Personalized medicine","3D printers; Additives; Antibiotics; Bone; Bone cement; Coatings; Curing; Molds; Textures; Ultrasonics; antibiotic agent; bacitracin; bone cement; mineral oil; poly(methyl methacrylate); tobramycin; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Diseased bone; Intra-operative; Orthopaedic surgery; Personalized medicines; Point of care; Pushouts; Surface coatings; Ultrasound transmissions; Article; blood viscosity; coating (procedure); comparative study; drug efficacy; intraoperative period; nonhuman; orthopedic surgery; personalized medicine; room temperature; sample size; stereolithography; surface property; three dimensional printing; Adhesion","","bacitracin, 1405-87-4; poly(methyl methacrylate), 39320-98-4, 9008-29-1; tobramycin, 32986-56-4","","","","","Bagaria V., Chaudhary K., A paradigm shift in surgical planning and simulation using 3Dgraphy: experience of first 50 surgeries done using 3D-printed biomodels, Injury., 48, 11, pp. 2501-2508, (2017); Chi-Kay L., King-Him C., Kin-Bong L., Wilson L., Computer-assisted planning and three-dimensional-printed patient-specific instrumental guide for corrective osteotomy in post-traumatic femur deformity: A case report and literature review, J Orthop Trauma Rehabil, (2018); Lin C.Y., Wirtz T., LaMarca F., Hollister S.J., Structural and mechanical evaluations of a topology optimized titanium interbody fusion cage fabricated by selective laser melting process, J Biomed Mater Res A, 83, 2, pp. 272-279, (2007); Koeck F.X., Beckmann J., Luring C., Rath B., Grifka J., Basad E., Evaluation of implant position and knee alignment after patient-specific unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, Knee., 18, 5, pp. 294-299, (2011); Arce K., Morris J.M., Alexander A.E., Ettinger K.S., Developing a point-of-care manufacturing program for craniomaxillofacial surgery, Atlas Oral Maxillofac Surg Clin North Am, 28, 2, pp. 165-179, (2020); Physicians as Manufacturers, (2021); Beitler B.G., Abraham P.F., Glennon A.R., Tommasini S.M., Lattanza L.L., Morris J.M., Wiznia D.H., Interpretation of regulatory factors for 3D printing at hospitals and medical centers, or at the point of care, 3D Print Med, 8, 1, (2022); Ravi P., Chepelev L., Lawera N., Haque K.M.A., Chen V.C.P., Ali A., Rybicki F.J., A systematic evaluation of medical 3D printing accuracy of multi-pathological anatomical models for surgical planning manufactured in elastic and rigid material using desktop inverted vat photopolymerization, Med Phys, 48, 6, pp. 3223-3233, (2021); Mitsouras D., Liacouras P., Imanzadeh A., Giannopoulos A.A., Cai T., Kumamaru K.K., George E., Wake N., Caterson E.J., Pomahac B., Ho V.B., Grant G.T., Rybicki F.J., Medical 3D printing for the radiologist, RadioGraphics, 35, 7, pp. 1965-1988, (2015); Ravi P., Chepelev L.L., Stichweh G.V., Jones B.S., Rybicki F.J., Medical 3D printing dimensional accuracy for multi-pathological anatomical models 3D printed using material extrusion, J Digit Imaging, 35, 3, pp. 613-622, (2022); Wixted C.M., Peterson J.R., Kadakia R.J., Adams S.B., Three-dimensional printing in Orthopaedic surgery: Current applications and future developments, JAAOS: Glob Res Rev., 5, 4, (2021); Trauner K.B., The emerging role of 3D printing in arthroplasty and orthopedics, J Arthroplasty, 33, 8, pp. 2352-2354, (2018); Tetsworth K.D., Mettyas T., Overview of emerging technology in orthopedic surgery: what is the value in 3D modeling and printing?, Tech Orthop, 31, 3, pp. 143-152, (2016); Webb J.C.J., Spencer R.F., The role of polymethylmethacrylate bone cement in modern orthopaedic surgery, J Bone Joint Surg Br Vol, 89-B, 7, pp. 851-857, (2007); Thonse R., Conway J.D., MD2 antibiotic cement-coated nails for the treatment of infected nonunions and segmental bone defects, J Bone Joint Surg, 90, Issue Supplement_4, pp. 163-174, (2008); Kim J.W., Cuellar D.O., Hao J., Seligson D., Mauffrey C., Custom-made antibiotic cement nails: a comparative study of different fabrication techniques, Injury, 45, 8, pp. 1179-1184, (2014); Mauffrey C., Butler N., Hake M.E., Fabrication of an interlocked antibiotic/cement-coated carbon Fiber nail for the treatment of long bone osteomyelitis, J Orthop Trauma, 30, pp. S23-S24, (2016); Lindner J.R., Seligson D., Chisena E., Et al., Does an antibiotic nail made in a lubricated tube release antibiotic?, Eur J Orthop Surg Traumatol, 30, pp. 153-156, (2020); Instruction for Printing Biomed Amber Resin; Simplex Time Charts and Mixing Guide; Lee A.J., Ling R.S., Gheduzzi S., Simon J.P., Renfro R.J., Factors affecting the mechanical and viscoelastic properties of acrylic bone cement, J Mater Sci Mater Med, 13, 8, pp. 723-733, (2002)","B.

In particular, gyroid structures are suitable for bone tissue engineering applications, allowing to emulate the porosity of the inner part of the bone. In this frame, the mechanical properties of 17–4 PH steel gyroids made by additive manufacturing have been investigated. Three design methods have been implemented, i.e., thickness graded, size graded, and uniform, to address the lack of knowledge in the area of stainless-steel scaffolds aiming at providing a map of the mechanical properties. Compressive mechanical properties absorbed energy and absorption efficiency have been found for the aforementioned design methods. Furthermore, defects and collapse behavior have been analyzed: imperfections have been detected in the thin-walled areas of the graded samples. Nevertheless, under given conditions, the graded samples have mechanical properties comparable to those of uniform ones, exhibiting a controlled layer-by-layer collapse mechanism and consequent weight reduction. The Gibson-Ashby models have been implemented, and the calibration coefficients have been compared with other research works. A FEM-based numerical model has been proposed to reproduce the mechanical properties of the mentioned structures finding critical issues in the representation of defects. In this frame, the resulting Gibson Ashby calibration coefficients are in good agreement with the literature and reveal the graded samples have a bending-dominating behavior sustaining larger strains than the uniform case, giving the ground for high energy absorption applications. Furthermore, the FEM analyses are in good agreement with the literature providing a reliable tool to further investigate the metal functionally graded gyroid field. © 2022, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; Functionally graded materials; Lattice structures; Simulation","Additives; Bone; Calibration; Defects; Functionally graded materials; Structural design; Thin walled structures; Biomedical research; Bone tissue engineering; Calibration coefficients; Design method; Functionally graded; Gyroid structure; Gyroids; Lattice structures; Mechanical simulations; Simulation; 3D printers","","","","","Università degli Studi di Salerno, UNISA, (ORSA190501)","Open access funding provided by Università degli Studi di Salerno within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.

Considering the advantages of additive manufacturing technology, this study introduced the feasibility of developing a 3D printed resin-based composition modified with graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) to improve properties. Methods: Acrylate-based resin was impregnated with different concentrations of GNPs (0.0–0.25 wt%), and then different aspects such as mechanical, physical, biological and antimicrobial were analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness. TEM and SEM were used to characterize GNPs and their existence within the resin. Surface topography and roughness were evaluated using AFM. The degree of conversion and composition were confirmed by FTIR. Mechanical properties were detected using bending strength, microhardness and nanoindentation. Biocompatibility and antimicrobial activities were assessed with oral fibroblast and Candida albicans (C. albicans), respectively. In addition, most of the measurements were performed repeatedly after 3 months of storage in artificial saliva to evaluate performance. Results: GNPs improved strength significantly at low concentrations ≤ 0.05 wt%, while the addition up to 0.25 wt% enhanced printed nanocomposite hardness and elasticity. The modification did not induce a toxic response, as its biocompatibility was within the recommended range of biomedical devices. Antimicrobial activity was of prominence, as GNPs showed an outstanding route of reducing C. albicans activity associated with filler proportion. Significance: The embedment of GNPs in 3D printed resin can become a key material for customized applications that require high antimicrobial, stiffness and strength properties. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","3D printed resin; Additive manufacturing; Antimicrobial activity; Cytotoxicity; Graphene nanoplatelets; Mechanical strength","Anti-Infective Agents; Candida albicans; Graphite; Materials Testing; Nanocomposites; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Resins, Synthetic; Surface Properties; 3D printers; Additives; Bending strength; Biocompatibility; Candida; Cell culture; Cytotoxicity; Graphene; Microorganisms; Nanocomposites; Topography; Yeast; antiinfective agent; graphite; nanocomposite; resin; 3d printed resin; Anti-microbial activity; Candida albicans; Dental resins; Fabrication process; Graphene nanoplatelets; Mechanical; Mechanical strength; Natural appearance; Prosthetic rehabilitations; Candida albicans; materials testing; surface property; three dimensional printing; Resins","","graphite, 7782-42-5; Anti-Infective Agents, ; Graphite, ; Resins, Synthetic, ","","","Colgate Palmolive®, (00800/68001004, 00800/70237003, PG 008/10402012); University of Western Australia, UWA; King Saud University, KSU; Australian Dental Research Foundation, ADRF, (00800/51001600, PG 00800/51002200)","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the facilities, and the scientific and technical assistance of Microscopy Australia at the Centre for Microscopy, Characterisation & Analysis, The University of Western Australia, a facility funded by the University, State and Commonwealth Governments.

Apart from the many advantages, the lack of position feedback of soft grippers presents a problem for position control. This study aims to examine this problem with the SPG, which is fabricated using additive manufacturing technology. The soft gripper is fabricated in two parts using the molding technique. The structure of the gripper consists of molded silicone (room-temperature-vulcanizing [room-temperature-vulcanizing]-3015) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film consisting of chambers. These sections are an active chamber consisting of 10 airtight sections that can be operated with compressed air and a passive chamber covered with PET film. During the bending of the SPG, the PET film inside the passive chamber begins to be compressed by the compressed air, resulting in a higher load-holding capacity of the gripper. In addition, the position of the feedback module made of flex sensor is integrated during fabrication. Various experiments were carried out to evaluate the performance of the SPG. Finite element analysis of the gripper was performed with COMSOL to compare the accuracy of real-time experiments. With the experimental studies' results, the SPG's motion characteristics, the relationship between the bending angle and the pressure, and the position-tracking performance were analyzed. Experimental results of the SPG were found to be in good agreement with the simulation results. The experimental results determined that the SPG showed successful trajectory tracking performance with the proportional-integral-derivative control algorithm. The root mean square value for the controller is calculated as 0.1245°. © 2022 by ASTM International.","additive manufacturing; integrated sensor; position feedback; proportional-integral-derivative control; soft pneumatic gripper","Additives; Compressed air; Fabrication; Feedback; Grippers; Machine design; Plastic bottles; Pneumatics; Position control; Pressure vessels; Proportional control systems; Silicones; Two term control systems; Closed-loop; Integrated sensors; Pneumatic grippers; Polyethylene-terephthalate films; Position feedback; Proportional integral derivative control; Room temperature vulcanizing; Soft pneumatic gripper; Soft robotics; Tracking performance; 3D printers","","","","","Muş Alparslan Üniversitesi, (BAP-22-TBMYO-4902-04)","This research was supported by the Mus Alparslan University Technology Research and Project Coordination Unit as a project numbered BAP-22-TBMYO-4902-04.

La Masa 1, Milano, 20156, Italy","Only few high strength Al alloys are processable by Laser Powder Bed Fusion due to the occurrence of hot cracks during solidification. In recent years, the addition of Zr and Sc in Al-Mg alloys revealed an effective solutions to suppress solidification cracking and improve strength. Nevertheless, since Sc is classified as a critical raw material by European Commission due to its high cost and supply risk, its content should be desiderably reduced. It is therefore necessary to focus on novel Al alloys featuring both enhanced processability and low amount of Sc. In this study, we investigated the microstructure and mechanical behavior of an Al-5.2Mg-0.8Zr-0.3Sc alloy, commercially available as m4p™ StrengthAl, produced by Laser Powder Bed Fusion. Simulations of equilibrium phase diagrams and Scheil solidification curves showed the precipitation of primary Al3Zr and Al3(Sc,Zr) in the liquid phase on cooling. These particles revealed able to act as nuclei for heterogeneous nucleation of grains, giving rise to a fine equiaxed structure which is able to suppress hot cracking and increase the processability of the Al-Mg-Zr-Sc alloy. Despite the reduced Sc content, the formation of secondary Al3(Sc,Zr) nano-phases during the annealing treatment led to a sharp increase of micro-hardness values, whereas a stress relief effect was monitored by residual stress measurements during aging.

To improve cardiac tissue homogeneity and cardiomyocyte (CM) maturation, in this study, we investigated altering initial encapsulation geometry in a three-dimensional (3D) direct cardiac differentiation platform. Traditional engineered cardiac tissue production utilizes predifferentiated CMs to produce 3D cardiac tissue and often involves various cell selection and exogenous stimulation methods to promote CM maturation. Starting tissue formation directly with human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), rather than predifferentiated CMs, simplifies the engineered cardiac tissue formation process, making it more applicable for widespread implementation and scale-up. In this study, hiPSCs were encapsulated in poly (ethylene glycol)-fibrinogen in three tissue geometries (disc-shaped microislands, squares, and rectangles) and subjected to established cardiac differentiation protocols. Resulting 3D engineered cardiac tissues (3D-ECTs) from each geometry displayed similar CM populations (∼65%) and gene expression over time. Notably, rectangular tissues displayed less tissue heterogeneity and suggested more advanced features of maturing CMs, including myofibrillar alignment and Z-line formation. In addition, rectangular tissue showed significantly higher anisotropic contractile properties compared to square and microisland tissues (MI 0.28 ± 0.03, SQ 0.35 ± 0.05, RT 0.79 ± 0.04). This study demonstrates a straightforward method for simplifying and improving 3D-ECT production without the use of exogenous mechanical or electrical pacing and has the potential to be utilized in bioprinting and drug testing applications. Current methods for improving cardiac maturation postdifferentiation remain tedious and complex. In this study, we examined the impact of initial encapsulation geometry on improvement of three-dimensional engineered cardiac tissue (3D-ECT) production and postdifferentiation maturation for three tissue geometries, including disc-shaped microislands, squares, and rectangles. Notably, rectangular 3D-ECTs displayed less tissue heterogeneity and more advanced features of maturing cardiomyocytes, including myofibrillar alignment, Z-line formation, and anisotropic contractile properties, compared to microisland and square tissues. This study demonstrates an initial human induced pluripotent stem cell-encapsulated rectangular tissue geometry can improve cardiac maturation, rather than implementing cell selection or tedious postdifferentiation manipulation, including exogenous mechanical and/or electrical pacing.  © 2022 Mary Ann Liebert Inc.","cardiac differentiation; engineered heart tissue; human induced pluripotent stem cells; tissue geometry","Cell Differentiation; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; Tissue Engineering; Anisotropy; Cytology; Gene expression; Geometry; Heart; Histology; Polyethylene glycols; Stem cells; Tissue engineering; fibrinogen; macrogol; Cardiac differentiation; Cardiac tissues; Cardiomyocytes; Cell selection; Engineered heart tissues; Human-induced pluripotent stem cells; Myofibrillar; Tissue formation; Tissue geometry; Tissue heterogeneity; Article; bioprinting; blood flow velocity; cardiac muscle cell; cell encapsulation; cell selection; cell suspension; cell viability; drug screening; electroconvulsive therapy; engineered heart tissue; gene expression; geometry; heart tissue; human; induced pluripotent stem cell; scale up; tissue characterization; transmission electron microscopy; cardiac muscle; cardiac muscle cell; cell differentiation; procedures; tissue engineering; Tissue","","fibrinogen, 9001-32-5; macrogol, 25322-68-3","","","NSFCBET, (1743445); National Science Foundation, NSF, (NSF-CBET-1743445); National Institutes of Health, NIH, (UL1TR003096); National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI, (K01HL133424, R03-HL154286); State of New Jersey Department of Education, NJ DOE, (P200A150075, P200A180087); Auburn University, AU","Funding text 1: National Institutes of Health (No. UL1TR003096), the Department of Education GAANN (No. P200A150075 and P200A180087), National Science Foundation (No. NSFCBET- 1743445), and Auburn University Undergraduate Research Fellowship, National Institutes of Health/NHLBI K01-HL133424 and R03-HL154286.; Funding text 2: National Institutes of Health (No. UL1TR003096), the Department of Education GAANN (No. P200A150075 and P200A180087), National Science Foundation (No. NSF-CBET-1743445), and Auburn University Undergraduate Research Fellowship, National Institutes of Health/NHLBI K01-HL133424 and R03-HL154286.

In additive manufacturing and casting, the near-net-shape manufacturing results in a non-homogenous solidification and cooling of the parts, leading to significant local gradient in microstructural and defect features as well as deformation behavior. In this paper, a uniform damage tolerance assessment was developed based on fracture mechanical approaches of Murakami (√area) and Shiozawa for a reliable defect-based mechanical design of fatigue-loaded structures. The linear-elastic fracture mechanical (LEFM) approaches of Murakami and Shiozawa were used to calculate defect-based lifetime curves, where the cyclic stress intensity factor (ΔK) at the failure-initiating defect (√area) was used to describe the local stress concentration conditions, called K-N curves, instead of nominal stress-based S-N curves. The LEFM-based K-N curves did not allow to describe the fatigue behavior in terms of a unified fatigue design of AM and casting material. Therefore, the cyclic stress-strain (CSS) behavior was used for a plasticity-modification of the LEFM approach by calculating the effective cyclic J integral (ΔJeff) to plot J-based K-N curves, called Kj-N curves. This elastic-plastic fracture mechanical (EPFM) approach allowed a uniform fatigue damage tolerance (FDT) assessment of AM and cast Al-Si alloys for the HCF regime by FDT law and fatigue limit by FDT limit. Exemplarily, the FDT limit could be used to predict synthetic Haigh diagrams for specific AM and cast batches and derive process- and service-relevant knowledge on the effect of tensile or compressive mean stress. © 2022","Al-Si alloy; Fatigue damage tolerance assessment; Fracture mechanical approach; High cycle fatigue (HCF); Murakami approach","","","","","","","","Wang X., Xu S., Zhou S., Xu W., Leary M., Choong P., Qian M., Brandt M., Xie Y.M., Topological design and additive manufacturing of porous metals for bone scaffolds and orthopaedic implants: a review, Biomaterials, 83, pp. 127-141, (2016); Menge M., Rath D., Zeuner T., New chassis components as aluminum castings, ATZ Worldw, 107, pp. 9-10, (2005); Merkt S., Hinke C., Bultmann J., Brandt M., Xie Y.M., Mechanical response of TiAl6V4 lattice structures manufactured by selective laser melting in quasistatic and dynamic compression tests, Journal of Laser Application, 27, pp. 1-7, (2015); Hernandez F.C., Ramirez J.M., Mackay R., Al-Si Alloys: Automotive, aeronautical, and Aerospace Applications, (2017); Warmuzek M., Aluminum-silicon Casting Alloys - atlas of Microfractographs, (2004); Davis J.R., Alloying: understanding the basics, ASM International, pp. 351-416, (2001); Robles-Hernandez F.C., Sokolowski J.H., Effect and online prediction of electromagnetic stirring on microstructure refinement of the 319 Al-Si hypoeutectic alloy, Journal of Alloys and Compounds, 480, 2, pp. 416-421, (2009); Vissers R., van Huis M.A., Jansen J., Zandbergen H.W., Marioara C.D., Andersen S.J., The crystal structure of the β″-phase in Al-Mg-Si alloys, Acta Materialia, 55, pp. 3815-3823, (2007); Rometsch P., Arnberg L., Zhang D., Modeling dissolution of Mg2Si and homogenization in Al-Si-Mg casting alloys, International Journal of Cast Metals Research, 12, pp. 1-8, (1999); Pedersen L., Arnberg L., The effect of solution heat treatment and quenching rates on mechanical properties and microstructure in AlSiMg foundry alloys, Metallurgical and Materials Transactions A, 32, 3, pp. 525-532, (2001); Rometsch P., Schaffer G., Taylor J., Mass balance characterization of Al-7Si-Mg alloy microstructures as a function of solution treatment time, International Journal of Cast Metals Research, 14, pp. 59-69, (2001); Wang Q., Apelian D., Lados D., Fatigue behavior of A356-T6 aluminium cast alloys.

A PC-SOA and an optical filter have been used in this design. Nonlinear effects, such as carrier depletion (CD), carrier heating (CH), and spectral hole burning (SHB), have been included in the PC-SOA. The rate and propagation equations have been solved using the finite difference method (FDM). The optimal wavelength conversion based on XGM has been obtained in the PC-SOA through the application of 3.2fJ and 1.0pJ energies for the input and the continuous wave (CW) signals, respectively, and a 15mA injection current for the biasing. The effects of the injection current and input signal energies on wavelength conversion have also been investigated for further examination of the impact of the XGM mechanism on wavelength conversion. It has finally been demonstrated that the PC-SOA exhibits better conditions and performance than the conventional bulk SOA in wavelength conversion based on XGM. Furthermore, the PC-SOA provides a far more appropriate alternative than the bulk SOA for all-optical integrated circuits due to the smaller length of the device and the lower value of injected current. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","And finite difference method; Cross gain modulation; Photonic crystal semiconductor optical amplifier; Wavelength conversion","Finite difference method; Modulation; Optical frequency conversion; Optical signal processing; Optical switches; Semiconductor optical amplifiers; And finite difference method; Carrier depletion; Carrier heating; Computational studies; Cross gain modulation; Crystal semiconductors; Finite-difference methods; Injection currents; Nonlinear effect; Photonic crystal semiconductor optical amplifier; Photonic crystals","","","","","","","Malik D., Kaushik G., Wason A., Performance Evaluation of Optical Amplifiers for High-Speed Optical Networks, J.

Herein, a series of new red phosphors Sr1-xLa2+xAl2-xO7: xMn4+ (SLA: xMn4+) were synthesized by the high temperature solid-state reaction. The inconsistent charge number of Mn4+ dopant and substituted Al3+ ion can be compensated by manual adjusting of the proportion of Sr2+ and La3+ in the same crystallography site. The phosphor shows emission band at around 713 nm, which fits well with the absorption of Pfr (far-red light-absorbing phytochrome), meaning that the SLA: 0.006Mn4+ can promote plant growth. Furthermore, co-doped phosphor SLA: 0.006Mn4+, 0.006Dy3+ was prepared with interesting temperature-dependent luminescence. With temperature increasing, the emitting intensity of Mn4+ has a more pronounced decline in comparison with Dy3+. Due to this feature, SLA: 0.006Mn4+, 0.006Dy3+ can be used as a non-contact optical thermometer with Sa of 0.018 K−1 at 450 K and Sr of 1.458% K−1 at 425 K. © 2022","Optical temperature sensing; Phosphor; Photoluminescence; Plant growth","High temperature applications; Photoluminescence; Solid state reactions; Temperature sensors; Charge number; Emission bands; Far-red lights; High temperature solid-state reaction; La 3+; Optical temperature sensing; Plant growth; Red phosphors; Replacement strategy; Synthesised; Phosphors","","","","","Excellent Youth Fund of Henan Province, (212300410044); Key research project of Henan Province Office of Education , China, (21A150019); Key research project of Henan Province Office of Education, China; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (22075070); Science and Technology Innovation Talents in Universities of Henan Province, (22HASTIT003)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 22075070 ); Program for Science & Technology Innovation Talents in Universities of Henan Province , China ( 22HASTIT003 ); Excellent Youth Fund of Henan Province ( 212300410044 ), China; Key research project of Henan Province Office of Education , China (No. 21A150019 ). ; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 22075070); Program for Science & Technology Innovation Talents in Universities of Henan Province, China (22HASTIT003); Excellent Youth Fund of Henan Province (212300410044), China; Key research project of Henan Province Office of Education, China (No. 21A150019).","Yeh N., Chung J.-P., High-brightness LEDs-Energy efficient lighting sources and their potential in indoor plant cultivation, Renew.

The memristor-accurate modulation often requires multiple SET and RESET operations. Nonetheless, the most mature one-MOSFET-one-memristor (1T1R) array cannot support SET and RESET operation at different devices parallelly, which limits the array writing speed. In this work, we build a diagonal-gates-connection (DGC) memristor array model based on the practical TiN/HfOx/TaOx/TiN 1T1R device. Within the DGC array, devices sharing the common slope word line (SWL) can be SET or RESET independently at the same time for each device having an independent bitline (BL) and source line (SL). Furthermore, a sliding-window acquisition (SWA) strategy is proposed to optimize the writing performance of the DGC 1T1R array. In the simulation of digital image storage, the writing efficiency of DGC array has been significantly improved by utilizing the new SWA strategy, which achieves two data level improvements compared to traditional 1T1R arrays. This work demonstrates that large-scale memristor arrays operating in parallel hold great promise for applications that rely on high writing speed.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Memristor; multivalued memory; one-MOSFET-one-memristor (1T1R) arrays; parallel operation; writing strategy","Digital storage; Image enhancement; Integrated circuit interconnects; Modulation; MOSFET devices; Timing circuits; Array; Integrated circuit interconnections; Memristor; MOSFETs; Multi-valued memory; One-MOSFET-one-memristor (1t1r) array; Parallel operations; Performances evaluation; Writing; Writing strategy; Memristors","","","","","","","Kuhn K.J., Considerations for ultimate CMOS scaling, IEEE Trans.

The application of accelerated shelf-life testing (ASLT) procedures could allow to speed up the process. In this study, three fresh made extra virgin olive oils having increased total polyphenol content (156, 273 and 507 mg/kg) were stored at increasing temperatures (25, 40, 50 and 60 °C) in the dark in glass containers under reduced oxygen content to simulate market storage. The changes of K270 and % of pyropheophytin a (PPP) were found to be the best indicators to monitor product behaviour during storage. The rate constants of the changes of K270 and %PPP over time showed a temperature dependence that can be described with the Arrhenius model with activation energies (Ea) in the range of 49–65 kJ/mol and 115–122 kJ/mol for K270 and %PPP, respectively. These values confirmed the significant higher susceptibility of the parameter %PPP to temperature changes during storage, as also demonstrated by the estimated shelf-life values and relevant confidence intervals. Interestingly, the initial quality characteristics of the oils and especially the polyphenols content did not affect the temperature dependence of the rate constants of these indexes. It was concluded that %PPP could be used as a “rapid alert” indicator of product performances on the market and K270 as indicator to compute the compulsory value of “best before” date. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Accelerated test; Extra virgin olive oil; Modelling; Polyphenols; Pyropheophytin; Shelf-life","","","","","","","","Aparicio-Ruiz R., Aparacio R., Garcia-Gonzales G., Does “best before” date embody extra-virgin olive oil freshness?, Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 62, 3, pp. 554-556, (2014); Aparicio-Ruiz R., Minguez-Mosquera M.I., Gandul-Rojas B., Thermal degradation kinetics of chlorophyll pigments in virgin olive oils. 1.

First, parameters of a recent 10 parameter fractional derivative model are identified from dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) data for three different elastomeric pads that are used in railway system. The FDM gives accurate results in wide frequency ranges, however, the time domain representation of this model includes fractional derivatives that substantially increase the computation time. To overcome this drawback, five-armed Generalized Maxwell Model (GMM) parameters are fitted in 0.01–1000 Hz to be used in the time domain analyses. The mathematical models of two distinct types of railway superstructure are obtained and solved by the Galerkin's method. The results of proposed framework are tested against measurements and the results of finite element model (FEM) analyses and very good agreement is observed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","DMA; Fractional derivative; Hereditary integral; Rail pad; Railway track; Viscoelastic model","Railroad tracks; Railroads; Rails; Time domain analysis; Viscoelasticity; Elastomeric pads; Experimental validations; Fractional derivative model; Fractional derivatives; Hereditary integral; Rail pads; Railway system; Railway track; Viscoelastic models; Wide frequency range; Galerkin methods","","","","","Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu, TÜBİTAK, (115M586)","The financial support of the Program for Scientific and Technological Research Projects (1001) by the Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) (Project No: 115M586) is gratefully acknowledged.","Grassie S.L., Railpads R., Their dynamic behaviour in the laboratory and on track, Proc.

It was found that the solids show only the diffraction peaks of TiO2 anatase phase with high surface area and porosity. The type of transition metal affects the physicochemical properties and photocatalytic activity of M−TiO2 catalysts which were found more active and more selective to CO2 using UV illumination. Only the Nb-TiO2 solid was less active than TiO2. However, 0.5 % Zr-TiO2 sample was the most efficient catalyst for the photodegradation of 2-propanol with 58 % as 2-propanol maximum conversion to CO2 (54.4 %) and acetone (45.6 %) under UV.

The Bacterial Leaf Blight (BLB) disease influences rice standards. Prevailing research practices have less accuracy and could not surmount the noise of the images. This paper proposed Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse Weight-related Deep Convolutional Neural Network (MPW-DCNN) overcomes such complications for the BLB disease identification system. The proposed method encompasses six phases. First, the Image Acquisition (IA) procedure is accomplished, next the pre-processing is carried out, in which the noise of the input rice leaf image is mitigated using the Hybrid Gaussian-Weiner (HGW) filter, and the image pixel is normalized by utilizing min-max normalization. Then, the segmentation of the input image is done by Improved Fuzzy C-Means (IFCM). Next, the features, such as entropy, energy, correlation, contrast, homogeneity, colour histogram, and Scale-Invariant Feature Transforms (SIFT) are extracted from the segmented image. Then, the efficient features are chosen by applying the Exhaustiveness and Brownian Motion-related Elephant Herding Optimization (EBM-EHO) algorithm. Then, these selected features are fed to the MPW-DCNN classifier, which categorizes the image as 'BLB malady' or ‘normal’ or else 'chances being influenced by other maladies'. Lastly, the proposed MPW-DCNN performance is equated with the prevailing classification algorithm, and better accuracy is proffered by the proposed work than the prevalent algorithms. The accuracy of the implemented approach is 2.36, 3.08, 4.62, 5.13, and 6.15% improved than the existing methods, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) + Deep features, AlexNet, Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), respectively. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Brownian motion-based Elephant Herding Optimization;

The profile of the convex wall adopts the blade pattern of classic centrifugal pumps, namely, spiral line (SL) and involute line (IL). A new coordinate (so'R) with streamwise and curvature radial directions is introduced to adapt to the requirements of variable curvature. Based on coordinate transformation, the profiles of mean streamwise velocity (us) and centrifugal velocity (uR), positions of velocity extreme, vorticity, total shear stress and root mean square (rms) velocities (us’and uR’) under the new coordinate system (so'R) are analyzed to investigate the effects of variable curvature and Reynolds number. The results provide a useful reference to perform curvature correction of turbulence models and guide the design of fluid machinery with variable curvature flow channel. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Blade pattern; Convex wall; Involute line; Particle image velocimetry (PIV); Spiral line; Variable curvature","Channel flow; Ducts; Flow visualization; Machine design; Reynolds number; Shear flow; Shear stress; Turbulence models; Velocimeters; Velocity; Velocity measurement; Wall flow; Blade pattern; Convex wall; Curved ducts; Image velocimetry; Involute line; Particle image velocimetry; Particle images; Reynold number; Spiral lines; Variable curvature; Turbulent flow","","","","","Maritime Research Centre; Nanyang Technological University, NTU; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51809120); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2018M640462); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (BK20180871); Natural Science Research of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China, (18KJB470005)","This work is financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51809120 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (No. BK20180871 ), the Project Funded by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2018M640462 ) and the Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China (No. 18KJB470005 ).

The compressive elastic and plastic behaviors have been well established for many TPMS latticed structures, but not under multiaxial loading. Furthermore, TPMS lattices are computationally expensive to model explicitly when used in latticing various structures for enhanced multi-functionality, and hence the need to develop accurate yield surfaces in order to capture their plastic behavior in a homogenized approach. The majority of previous yield surfaces developed for cellular materials originate from cellular foams, and limited attempts has been made to develop yield surfaces for TPMS lattices. In this study, a numerical modeling framework is proposed for developing the initial yield surface for cellular materials and is used to develop the initial yield surface for Schoen's IWP sheet-based TPMS cellular lattices. The effect of different loading conditions on the effective yield strength of the IWP sheet-based (IWP-s) TPMS lattice is numerically investigated, based on a single unit cell of IWP-s under fully periodic boundary conditions, assuming an elastic-perfectly plastic behavior of the base material, for relative densities (ρ‾) ranging from 7% to 28%. In order to account for different loading conditions, the stress state is characterized in a generalized fashion through the Lode parameter (L). The effect of L is studied over a range of mean stress values (σm) to understand the effect of both L and σm on the effective yield strength. An initial yield surface is developed incorporating the effect of L, σm and ρ‾, and is validated numerically showing rather good agreement. In the 3D principal stress space, the shape of the yield surface for the IWP-s lattice resembles the shape of a cocoa pod. © 2022 The Authors","Architected materials; Lode; Micromechanics; Stress triaxiality; TPMS; Yield surface","Additives; Cellular manufacturing; Stress analysis; Architected material; Cellular material; Elastic and plastic behaviors; Lode; Lode parameter; Plastic behavior; Stress triaxiality; Surface lattice; Triply periodic minimal surfaces; Yield surface; Yield stress","","","","","Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research, KU, (RCII-2019-003)","The authors acknowledge the financial support provided by Khalifa University under Award No. RCII-2019-003 .

In this paper, we describe a new method for children handwriting quality analysis. It automatically detects mistakes, gives real-time on-line feedback for children’s writing, and helps teachers comprehend and evaluate children’s writing skills. The proposed method adjudges five main criteria: shape, direction, stroke order, position respect to the reference lines, and kinematics of the trace. It analyzes the handwriting quality and automatically gives feedback based on the combination of three extracted models: Beta-Elliptic Model (BEM) using similarity detection (SD) and dissimilarity distance (DD) measure, Fourier Descriptor Model (FDM), and perceptive Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Support Vector Machine (SVM) comparison engine. The originality of our work lies partly in the system architecture which apprehends complementary dynamic, geometric, and visual representation of the examined handwritten scripts and in the efficient selected features adapted to various handwriting styles and multiple script languages such as Arabic, Latin, digits, and symbol drawing. The application offers two interactive interfaces respectively dedicated to learners, educators, experts or teachers and allows them to adapt it easily to the specificity of their disciples. The evaluation of our framework is enhanced by a database collected in Tunisia primary school with 400 children.

Karamanlis Avenue, Chania, 73134, Greece","Gazania rigens (L.) Gaertn. (Asteraceae) is a medicinal plant with high ornamental potential and use in landscaping. The therapeutic potential of sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) as plant natural products for pharmaceutical development has gained extensive interest with costunolide (chemical name: 6E,10E,11aR-6,10-dimethyl-3-methylidene-3a,4,5,8,9,11a-hexahydrocyclodeca[b]furan-2-one) used as a popular herbal remedy due to its anti-cancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-allergic, and anti-diabetic activities, among others. In the present study, two explant types (leaf, stem) and four 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) concentrations (0, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/L) were tested for callusing potential. The results showed that stem explants treated with 1.5 mg/L 2,4-D exhibited higher callus induction percentage (90%) followed by leaf explants (80%) with 1 mg/L 2,4-D, after a 4-week period. Cell suspension cultures were established from friable callus obtained from stem explants following a sigmoid pattern of growth curve with a maximum fresh weight at 20 days of subculture and a minimum one at 5 days of subculture. In the following stage, the effects of elicitation of cell suspension cultures with either yeast extract (YE) or methyl jasmonate (MeJA), each applied in five concentrations (0, 100, 150, 200 and 250 mg/L) on cell growth (fresh and dry biomass) and costunolide accumulation were tested. After 20 days of culture, YE or MeJA suppressed cell growth as compared to the non-elicited cells, while costunolide accumulation was better enhanced under the effect of 150 mg/L MeJA followed by 200 mg/L YE, respectively. In the subsequent experiment conducted, the optimal concentration of the two elicitors (200 mg/L YE, 150 mg/L MeJA) was selected to investigate further elicitation time (0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 days). The results revealed that YE biotic elicitation stimulated cell growth and costunolide production, being maximum on day 20 for fresh biomass, on day 5 for dry biomass and on day 15 for the bioactive compound. Accordingly, cell growth parameters were maximized under the effect of abiotic elicitation with MeJA for 15 days, while highest costunolide content was achieved after 10 days. Overall, MeJA served as a better elicitor type than YE for biomass and costunolide production. Irrespective of elicitor type, elicitor concentration and elicitation time, maximal response was obtained with 150 mg/L MeJA for 10 days regarding costunolide accumulation (18.47 ppm) and 15 days for cell growth (fresh weight: 954 mg and dry weight: 76.3 mg). The application of elicitors can lead the large quantity of costunolide to encounter extensive range demand through marketable production without endangering of G. rigens.

In this paper, we examine piezoresistive force sensors based on carbon nanotube fibers fabricated by a novel wet pulling technique. The developed sensor is characterized by an adjustable force range coupled with high sensitivity to enable the detection of a wide range of forces and displacements limited by the experimental setup only. We have demonstrated the applicability of the developed unit in tactile sensing, displacement sensing, and nanophone vibration monitoring system and evaluated its force sensing characteristics, i.e. displacement/force input and resistance/mechanical response. In the experiments it measures 0-115 N force range within 2.5 mm displacement. Moreover, the sensor demonstrates good linearity, low hysteresis, and stability when tested over 10 000 cycles. The developed sensor suits multiple applications in the field of soft and transparent sensors, nanophones, actuators, and other robotics devices for both regular and extreme environments, e.g. deep underwater and radioactive environment. © 2022 The Author(s).

Different grain morphology and crystallographic textures were found in the EB-PBF and L-PBF samples, which significantly influenced their mechanical properties through microscopic deformation. The EB-PBF and L-PBF samples achieved energy absorption capacities of 627.4 mJ/mm3 and 834.8 mJ/mm3, respectively, at a lattice relative density of ∼24%. The EB-PBF sample exhibited equiaxed and elongated grains, while elongated grains were primarily observed in the L-PBF sample. The dominant deformation mechanism of the EB-PBF sample was obtained through dislocation. In contrast, the dislocations trapped inside the solidification cellular walls and deformation-induced twinning were the dominant deformation mechanisms for the L-PBF sample, which contributed to its superior compressive strength and energy absorption capacities. This work provides insights into the enhancement of the mechanical properties of the additively manufactured metallic lattice structures through microstructural control. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Crystallographic texture; Mechanical response; Powder bed fusion; Re-entrant structure; Strengthening mechanism","3D printers; Austenitic stainless steel; Compressive strength; Electron beams; Energy absorption; Fabrication; Morphology; Textures; Crystallographic textures; Electron-beam; Laser powders; Lattice structures; Mechanical response; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion; Re-entrant structure; Stainless steel (316L); Strengthening mechanisms; Deformation","","","","","DNV Singapore Pte.

Anatomical models can be generated from patient scans using a wide array of software, but there are limited studies on the geometric variance that is introduced during the digital conversion of images to models. The final accuracy of the 3D printed model is a function of manufacturing hardware quality control and the variability introduced during the multiple digital steps that convert patient scans to a printable format. This study provides a brief summary of common algorithms used for segmentation and refinement. Parameters for each that can introduce geometric variability are also identified. Several metrics for measuring variability between models and validating processes are explored and assessed. Methods: Using a clinical maxillofacial CT scan of a patient with a tumor of the mandible, four segmentation and refinement workflows were processed using four software packages. Differences in segmentation were calculated using several techniques including volumetric, surface, linear, global, and local measurements. Results: Visual inspection of print-ready models showed distinct differences in the thickness of the medial wall of the mandible adjacent to the tumor. Volumetric intersections and heatmaps provided useful local metrics of mismatch or variance between models made by different workflows. They also allowed calculations of aggregate percentage agreement and disagreement which provided a global benchmark metric. For the relevant regions of interest (ROIs), statistically significant differences were found in the volume and surface area comparisons for the final mandible and tumor models, as well as between measurements of the nerve central path. As with all clinical use cases, statistically significant results must be weighed against the clinical significance of any deviations found. Conclusions: Statistically significant geometric variations from differences in segmentation and refinement algorithms can be introduced into patient-specific models. No single metric was able to capture the true accuracy of the final models. However, a combination of global and local measurements provided an understanding of important geometric variations. The clinical implications of each geometric variation is different for each anatomical location and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by clinicians familiar with the process. Understanding the basic segmentation and refinement functions of software is essential for sites to create a baseline from which to evaluate their standard workflows, user training, and inter-user variability when using patient-specific models for clinical interventions or decisions. © 2022, The Author(s).","3D printing; Algorithms; Geometric variation; Hospital; Medical image segmentation; Patient-specific anatomical model; Point of care; Segmentation variation","3D modeling; Computerized tomography; Geometry; Image segmentation; Medical imaging; Patient treatment; Quality control; Three dimensional computer graphics; Tumors; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Anatomical modeling; Geometric variations; Medical image segmentation; Patient specific; Patient-specific anatomical model; Point of care; Segmentation variation; Work-flows; algorithm; Article; data analysis software; digital imaging and communications in medicine; image segmentation; mandible tumor; surface area; three dimensional printing; tumor model; tumor volume; volume; workflow; x-ray computed tomography; 3D printers","","","","","","","Medical Additive S.M.E., Manufacturing/3D Printing.

Traditional particle- or fiber-like fillers are known to result in reduced powder flowability and the uncontrollable morphology of composite powders. In this work, we demonstrate a first example of improving the powder properties and L-PBF manufacturability of metallic powders decorated by two-dimensional (2D) nanofillers. 0.5 wt% graphene oxide (GO) sheets were uniformly adhered onto the surface of Ti–6Al–4V (Ti64) powders via an electrostatic self-assembly, with their spherical morphology and particle size uncompromised. The notably enhanced quality of the GO-decorated Ti64 (GO@Ti64) powder bed, indicated by the results of a novel centrifugal separation testing and a recoating experiment, was attributed to the significant reduction in powder/powder and powder/substrate adhesive forces. Moreover, while the thermal conductivity of the GO@Ti64 powders was found to decrease, the laser absorptivity increased as a result of multiple local absorptions of wrinkled GO. The optimal process zone of GO@Ti64 powders was therefore shown to have been extended and to have become wider, enhancing L-PBF printability. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy inspections revealed that the GO/Ti64 build fully consisted of ultrafine α’ martensite structures with a lath width of ∼91 nm. This novel structure was attributed to the high-temperature, nonequilibrium densification of L-PBF; the complete dissolution of the 2D GO nanosheets into the Ti64 matrix generated a novel carbon-supersaturated, precipitation-free structure. The grain refinement and solid-solution strengthening behaviors led to an increase in the yield strength of the GO/Ti64 build from 1375 MPa to 1793 MPa, and also an increase in its compressive strength, from 1796 MPa to 2032 MPa. The results of this investigation contribute to a better understanding of composite powder properties and can be seen as a significant step toward the preparation of high-performance metallic components via L-PBF. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Graphene; Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF); Microstructural evolution; Powder properties; Solid solution strengthening","Adhesives; Compressive strength; Grain refinement; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Microstructural evolution; Morphology; Particle size; Solid solutions; Thermal conductivity; Composite powders; Graphene oxides; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Manufacturability; Performance; Powder bed; Powder properties; Solid solution strengthening; Ti-6al-4v; Graphene","","","","","Council for Science, Technology and Innovation, CSTI; Swine Innovation Porc, SIP; Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST; Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (JP22J23081, 22KJ0322)","This work was supported by Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (CSTI) , Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP), \u201CMaterials Integration\u201D for revolutionary design system of structural materials (Funding Agency: JST).

Therefore, the EBMed aluminum alloys commonly have coarser solidification structures such that lower mechanical properties compared to their SLMed counterparts. In this work, we proposed a strategy of introducing TiB2 particles into heat-resistant Al-Cu-Mg-Fe-Ni alloy to enhance the grain refinement and heat resistance for EBM fabrication. Applying a “presintering-densification” scanning strategy, near fully dense samples were build up with precise contours and good surface quality. The as-built EBMed TiB2/Al-Cu-Mg-Fe-Ni composite possessed a highly homogeneous microstructure with uniformly distributed TiB2 and Fe/Ni rich intermetallic particles. A fully equiaxed grain structure was achieved in the composite with a profoundly refined grain size of ~9 µm. The improved grain refinement effect was attributed to the sufficient activation of TiB2 particles as heterogeneous nuclei under a high cooling rate. Additionally, the solidified microstructure has shown an excellent thermal stability under ~500 °C during EBM process. The coexistence of thermal stable TiB2 and Fe, Ni-rich intermetallics at grain boundaries restricted the grain growth effectively. The as-built composite exhibited a high tensile strength of 253.4 MPa with an outstanding elongation of 13.5 %. After a T6-like heat treatment, the tensile strength was increased to 322 MPa with an elongation of 9.8 %. This study might shed a new light on designing high performance aluminum alloys/composites suitable for EBM technique. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Al-Cu-Mg-Fe-Ni; Electron beam melting; Metal matrix composites; Thermal stability; TiB<sub>2</sub>","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Cooling; Copper alloys; Electron beam melting; Electron beams; Grain boundaries; Grain growth; Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; Heat resistance; Heat treatment; Intermetallics; Iron alloys; Magnesium alloys; Metallic matrix composites; Nickel alloys; Specific heat; Tensile strength; Textures; Thermodynamic stability; Titanium alloys; Al-Cu-Mg; Al-cu-mg-fe-ni; Composite additives; Electron-beam melting; Grains refinement; Laser-based additive manufacturing; Manufacturing techniques; Matrix composite; Metal matrix; Metal matrix composite; 3D printers","","","","","Tianjin Qbeam-3d Technology Co.

However, the effect of cells in the cell-laden hydrogel's rheological profile is often ignored. As a result, there is a significant difference in the predicted and experimental outcome in the structural stability of the construct as well as on the cell viability, proliferation, and differentiation potential of the embedded cells. Our present study has addressed the effect of different cell densities (0.1 million cells/ml, 0.5 million cells/ml, 1 million cells/ml and 2 million cells/ml) of TVA-BMSCs on the flow property, modulus behaviour, gelation kinetics and printability of our proprietary silk fibroin-gelatin (5SF-6G) bioink. The cell-laden hydrogels demonstrated a characteristic shear thinning behaviour (low initial viscosity), low storage modulus and increased gelation time when compared to the acellular 5SF-6G hydrogel. The printability analysis also portrayed a square pore geometry with low spreading ratio in 1 million cells/ml encapsulated 5SF-6G hydrogel comparable to the acellular hydrogel. We postulated that incorporation of cells in the bioink interfered with the gelation mechanism of the mushroom tyrosinase in the 5SF-6G bioink by masking the active sites. Additionally, the mechanistic crosstalk between the cell-surface integrins with the cell-attachment motifs of the biomaterial alters the cellular biomechanics of the cell that in-turn profoundly impacts the rheological properties of the polymer blend. Therefore, cell density of 1 million cells/ml was considered the best fit for extrusion-based 3D bioprinting owing to its optimum rheological traits and printability index akin the acellular hydrogel. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D bioprinting; Cell-laden hydrogel; Printability; Rheology; Silk fibroin-gelatin","silk fibroin; animal cell; Article; attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; biodegradability; biomechanics; bioprinting; Bombyx mori; cell adhesion; cell density; cell differentiation; cell encapsulation; cell proliferation; cell viability; chondrocyte; decellularization; dispersity; encapsulation; flow cytometry; flow kinetics; genetic variation; geometry; human; human cell; mechanotransduction; mouse; nonhuman; shear stress; three dimensional bioprinting; three-dimensional imaging; tissue engineering; Young modulus","","","","","","","Chakraborty J., Ghosh S., Cellular proliferation, self-assembly, and modulation of signaling pathways in silk fibroin gelatin-based 3D bioprinted constructs, ACS Appl.

Fractography analysis interpreted together with the S–N curves indicates that fatigue failure in as-built and heat-treated conditions where <0.2% porosity was present, was mainly driven by early-stage crack growth. However, crack initiation was determined to be the main controlling factor for fatigue deformation of HIP'ed samples. Moreover, a strong correlation between the impact energy and fatigue limit was found. The findings were based on detailed microstructural and crystallographic characterization, as well as mechanical testing. The as-built and heat-treated conditions exhibited poor fatigue response in comparison to HIP'ed which is largely attributed to the lower levels of porosity identified. Even though similar levels of porosity are present in as-built and heat-treated samples, improvement in fatigue limit was determined in the heat-treated condition due to phase transformation and microstructural coarsening leading to reduction in micro-strain. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Fatigue behaviour; Microstructural characterization; Selective laser melting (SLM); Titanium alloys","Additives; Coarsening; Cracks; Fatigue of materials; Fracture mechanics; Mechanical testing; Selective laser melting; Titanium alloys; Well testing; Condition; Fatigue behaviour; Fatigue Limit; Heat treated condition; Laser powders; Microstructural characterizations; Powder bed; Selective laser melting; Titanium (alloys); Porosity","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/S022635/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, (16/RC/3872, 18/EPSRC-CDT/3584); Science Foundation Ireland, SFI","Funding text 1: This research was co-funded by the Science Foundation Ireland ( SFI ) and Stryker through I-Form, the SFI Research Centre for Advanced Manufacturing and the Advanced Metallic Systems Centre for Doctorial Training ( AMS – CDT ). ; Funding text 2: This publication has emanated from research conducted with the financial support of Science Foundation Ireland under Grant number 16/RC/3872 .

Since then, numerous factors have challenged the relevance of the LPI, including advancements in technology, the long-term reliability of these indicators, the incidence of emerging contaminants, and the LPI's efficacy. As a result, using LPI as a benchmark can lead to misinterpretation of the magnitude of leachate pollution. To mitigate this, a revised leachate pollution index (r-LPI) was developed, which is more precise and robust in assessing the pollution potential of landfill leachate. This article presents a comprehensive account of the development of r-LPI. The r-LPI was developed by incorporating a fuzzy technique with a novel hybrid multi-criteria decision-making method, wherein the inputs from 60 experts in the field of the environment, specifically solid waste management, were acquired at different stages during its development. The fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) was used to select the parameters. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) was used to compute the relative weights of the parameters, and sub-index curves were used for the normalization of the parameters. As an application, the LPI and the r-LPI of the Bhalswa, Okhla, and Ghazipur landfills were calculated. The results indicate that r-LPI provides a more comprehensive prediction of leachate pollution than LPI. © 2022 The Institution of Chemical Engineers","Environmental indices; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Fuzzy Delphi method; Landfill leachate; Leachate pollution; Municipal solid waste","Analytic hierarchy process; Decision making; Leachate treatment; Pollution; Contamination potentials; Emerging contaminant; Environmental index; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Fuzzy Delphi Method; Fuzzy techniques; Landfill leachates; Leachate pollution; Leachate pollution indices; Municipal solid waste","","","","","","","Abunama T., Moodley T., Abualqumboz M., Kumari S., Bux F., Variability of leachate quality and polluting potentials in light of Leachate Pollution Index (LPI) – a global perspective, Chemosphere, (2021); Abunama T., Othman F., Younes M.K., (2019); Agbozu I., Oghama O., Odhikori J., Physico-chemical characterization and pollution index determination of leachates from Warri waste dumpsite, Southern Nigeria, J.

The candidate for long-range continental communications is the L-band Digital Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS). LDACS is a cellular, ground-based digital communications system for flight guidance and communications related to safety and regularity of flight. Hence, the aeronautical standards, imposed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), for cybersecurity of the link and network layer, apply. In previous works, threat- and risk analyses of LDACS were conducted, a draft for an LDACS cybersecurity architecture introduced, algorithms proposed, and the security of a Mutual Authentication and Key Establishment (MAKE) procedure of LDACS formally verified. However, options for cipher-suites and certificate management for LDACS were missing. Also, previous works hardly discussed the topic of post-quantum security for LDACS. This paper proposes a cell-attachment procedure, which establishes a secure LDACS communication channel between an aircraft and corresponding ground-station upon cell-entry of the aircraft. Via the design of a hybrid LDACS Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), the choice of a pre- or post-quantum Security Level (SL) is up to the communications participants. With that, this work introduces a full LDACS cell-attachment protocol based on a PKI, certificates, certificate revocation and cipher-suites including pre- and post-quantum options. Evaluations in the symbolic model show the procedure to fulfill LDACS security requirements and a communications performance evaluation demonstrates feasibility, matching requirements imposed by regulatory documents.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","authentication; communications performance; Cybersecurity; FACTS2; key establishment; LDACS; post-quantum cryptography; tamarin","Aircraft communication; Authentication; Civil aviation; Computer architecture; Cybersecurity; Digital communication systems; Network architecture; Network security; Public key cryptography; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Secure communication; Aeronautical communications; Cipher; Communication performance; Communications systems; Cyber security; Europe; FACTS2; Key establishments; L-band digital aeronautical communication system; Post quantum cryptography; Security; Tamarin; Safety engineering","","","","","","","Handbook on radio frequency spectrum requirements for civil aviation, volume I, ICAO spectrum strategy, policy statements and related information, (2022); Mahmoud M.S.B., Pirovano A., Larrieu N., Aeronautical communication transition from analog to digital data: A network security survey, Comput.

Bioprinting offers a promising technology to fabricate customized cell-laden skin substitutes. In this study, a hydrogel of biodegradable polyurethane (PU)-gelatin (4:1) laden with human fibroblasts, endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), and keratinocytes was used as the bioink for building a bi-layer dermo-epidermal skin substitute. The seven-layer cell-laden constructs with stack thickness of 1.4 mm were precisely deposited through a 210 μm nozzle with an air pressure of 0.055–0.175 MPa and nozzle temperature of 19 °C. When grown in vitro, three types of cells in the bioprinted constructs showed good cell viability (>99%) in 24 h and reached a high proliferation rate (>220%) in 14 days. Significantly, EPCs were successfully differentiated into endothelial-like cells in the constructs and expressed the vasculogenesis-related proteins (CD31+ and eNOS+). When implanted in vivo, the bi-layer constructs attained ∼90% wound healing ratio and ∼76% re-epithelialization after 28 days in the nude mice model. Histological analyses revealed that skin wounds treated with the bi-layer constructs achieved high degrees of tissue integration and collagen production after 28 days. Vasculogenesis and angiogenesis of the wound treated with bi-layer constructs was significantly greater (∼300%) than those of the untreated wounds. The in vitro and in vivo findings indicate that the bioprinted skin substitutes with fibroblasts, EPCs, and keratinocytes embedded in PU-gelatin hydrogel may offer a promising strategy for clinical wound treatment and development of bioprinted skin. © 2022","3D bioprinting; Polyurethane; Skin bioprinting; Tissue engineering; Wound healing","","","","","","Animal Center, and medical 3D printing center at the National Defense Medical Center; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (109-2218-E-002-037, 110-2218-E-002-037); Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST; Tri-Service General Hospital, TSGH","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (MOST 109-2218-E-002-037 ; 110-2218-E-002-037 ).

A dual-stage heating nozzle with a preheating function is designed to promote the melt of filaments and then enhance the mechanical properties of finished specimens because of the low thermal conductivity of continuous glass fiber composites. The influence of traction speed on the morphology and mechanical properties of the composite filaments in preparation is first examined to obtain high-strength composite filaments. Additionally, the influence of preheating temperature on the heating effect of the filament and the evolution of the temperature field of the filament during the heating process are analyzed via thermal imaging and finite element approaches. Based on the printing device with a dual-stage heating nozzle, the cuboid-shaped tensile, flexural, interlaminar shear, and impact specimens with zero raster angles are also prepared and tested, and the influences of preheating temperature, printing speed, filament traction speed, hatch spacing, and fiber content on their strengths are discussed. Finally, the ring and cuboid-shaped samples are printed with parameters having better strength, and their electrical properties at various temperatures and frequency bands are tested by the probe, airline, and waveguide methods. The obtained results reveal that a lower traction speed is beneficial to improving the fiber dispersion in filaments, and the roundness and strength of the filaments. Preheating is also helpful to enhance the tensile and flexural strengths of the composite specimens, and the maximum strengths are obtained at a preheating temperature of 405 °C and printing speed of 1.5 mm/s, with an increase of 3.5% and 25.84%, respectively, compared with the no-preheated case. By process optimization, the tensile, flexural, interlaminar shear, and impact strengths of the specimens in order reach 524.33 MPa, 598.57 MPa, 46.28 MPa, and 173.91 kJ/m2. © 2022","Additive manufacturing;

The main purpose of this study is to introduce the newly designed complex airway stent models that are created through mathematical functions and manufactured with 3D printing for implementation in real life. Methods: A mathematical modeling software (MathMod) was used to design five different airway stents. The highly porous structures with designated scales were fabricated by utilizing a stereolithography-based 3D printing technology. The fine details in the microstructure of 3D printed parts were observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The mechanical properties of airway stents with various designs and porosity were compared by compression test. Results: The outputs of the mathematical modeling software were successfully converted into 3D printable files and airway stents with a porosity of more than 85% were 3D printed. SEM images revealed the layered topography of high-resolution 3D printed parts. Compression tests have shown that the mathematical function-based design offers the opportunity to adjust the mechanical strength of airway stents without changing the material or manufacturing method. Conclusions: A novel approach, which includes mathematical function-based design and 3D printing technology, is proposed in this study for the fabrication of airway stents as a promising tool for future treatments of central airway pathologies. © 2022, The Author(s).","3D printing;

However, the foundry industry has not been sufficiently researched to use multiple molding technologies to reduce energy and carbon emissions. This study proposes a method for reducing energy consumption, carbon emissions, and improving resource efficiency in the foundry industry by combining multiple molding technologies into the modular design. More specifically, the proposed method analyses the indicators of resource utilization, energy consumption and effective energy degree per unit casting, carbon emissions and effective carbon emissions degree per unit casting (resource utilization, energy consumption and effective energy degree per unit casting, carbon emissions and effective carbon emissions degree per unit casting as indices of the ecological impact of the process solution). The experimental results show that the proposed composite mold modules have self-adaptability in forming. Using composite technologies, energy savings of about 8.92% and 6.99% per unit casting may be achieved in single small batch and batch casting manufacturing. Although the energy efficiency of casting is close to that of Additive Manufacturing, the time consumption per unit is much lower, which has significant application value. The results also show that the composite technologies save 6.99% energy in mass production, reduce 11.06% carbon emissions and 5.571 h in manufacturing per unit casting compared to traditional casting methods. Due to the long manufacturing time, the benefits of a single technology (sand 3D printing and sand mold milling) rapidly diminish in mass production. Therefore, composite technologies are a feasible solution to achieve sustainable development of the foundry industry. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Energy and carbon emission model; Foundry industry; Patternless casting; Sustainable manufacturing","3D printers; Carbon; Energy efficiency; Foundries; Molding; Carbon emissions; Composites technology; Emission model; Energy and carbon emission model; Energy emissions; Foundry industries; Molding technologies; Pattern-less castings; Per unit; Sustainable manufacturing; Energy utilization","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51505428); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LY18E050007)","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China No. 51505428 and the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. LY18E050007 .","Industrial added value from National Data; Hawaldar N., Zhang J., A comparative study of fabrication of sand casting mold using additive manufacturing and conventional process, Int.

Because the support structures do not contribute any value to the part and need to be removed after manufacturing with extra costs and time, different studies have focused on minimizing the use of such structures. However, it is almost impossible to totally eliminate the need for support structures, especially in very complex parts with different overhang surfaces. Therefore, it is very important to optimize the support structure geometry to reduce support volume and consequently costs and time. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of tooth support geometrical parameters, namely tooth height, top length, base length, and base interval on the part's dimensional accuracy, surface roughness, microhardness through thickness, and support volume used in overhangs produced by laser powder bed fusion AM technology from Inconel 718 material. The L9 Taguchi design method was used to reduce the number of experiments. The efficiency of the parameters was determined by analysis of variance. Analyses of signal-to-noise ratios were used to obtain the optimum support parameter combination. The study reveals that tooth height has the highest effect on support volume and dimensional accuracy. Tooth base length was found to be the most effective parameter on surface roughness and microhardness through thickness. © 2022 by ASTM International.","analysis of variance; dimensional accuracy; laser powder bed fusion;

Thermally activated polymerization of thioctic acid (TA) enabled the bulk construction of poly(TA), and yielded unique time-dependent self-assembly. Freshly prepared poly(TA) can spontaneously and continuously transfer into higher-molecular-weight species and low-molecular-weight TA monomers. Poly(TA) and the newly formed TA further assembled into self-reinforcing materials via microscopic-phase separation. Bottom-up self-assembly patterns on different scales are fully realized by 3D FDM printing of poly(TA): thermally induced polymerization of TA (microscopic-scale assembly) to poly(TA) and 3D printing (macroscopic-scale assembly) of poly(TA) are simultaneously achieved in the 3D-printing process; after 3D printing, the poly(TA) modes show mechanically enhanced features over time, arising from the microscopic self-assembly of poly(TA) and TA. This study clearly demonstrates that micro- and macroscopic bottom-up self-assembly can be applied in 3D additive manufacturing. © 2022 The Authors.

In data security, the inability to decrypt and decrypt the signal to be encrypted retrospectively has always been the subject of research in terms of privacy. At this point, it was preferred to use the electrocardiography (ECG) signal, which is a signal that shows the vital signs of the human body and is also difficult to copy. In the study, firstly, the emulator circuit was obtained by using the mathematical model of the ECG signal. With this obtained signal, the audio signals are masked. The audio signal masked on the transmitter side and the signals providing synchronization were transmitted to the receiver side over a single channel using the frequency division multiplexing (FDM) method. Then, the sliding mode control (SMC) method was chosen for the synchronization of the ECG emulator circuits on the receiver and transmitter side. Histogram, spectral, mean square error (MSE), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), key space and key sensitivity, NSCR (number of sample change rate), UACI (unified average changing intensity) and PESQ (perceptual evaluation of speech quality) analyses were used to check the accuracy of the system. These analyses showed that the ECG encoding method has faster unit change, reduces synchronization time, minimizes losses and improves the security of the masked signal compared to other methods sent from two channels. Finally, use of an arrhythmia ECG signal for the synchronization signal on both the transmitter and receiver sides, the synchronization of this signal with the SMC method and the testing of a live audio recording in addition to the conversation, distinguishes the study from other existing studies and reveals its originality. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Shiraz University.","ECG emulator; Encryption; FDM method; Security analytics; Sliding mode control; Spectral entropy","","","","","","","","Abdelfatah R.I., Audio encryption scheme using self-adaptive bit scrambling and two multi chaotic-based dynamic DNA computations, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 69894-69907, (2020); Ahmad J., Hwang S.O., A secure image encryption scheme based on chaotic maps and affine transformation, Multimed Tools Appl, 75, 21, pp. 13951-13976, (2016); Akkus O., Bal T., Yagoobi H., Bekler O., Akkus G., Cabalak M., Electrocardiographic findings and cardiac safety of hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, Cukurova Med J, 46, 2, pp. 691-698, (2021); Almali M.N., Dikici Z., The simulation of sound signal masking with different chaotic oscillations and its circuit application, Turk J Electr Eng Comput Sci, 24, 5, pp. 4284-4293, (2016); Al-sawalha M.M., Synchronization of different order fractional-order chaotic systems using modify adaptive sliding mode control, Adv Differ Equ, 2020, 1, (2020); Alvarez G., Li S., Some basic cryptographic requirements for chaos-based cryptosystems, Int J Bifurcation Chaos, 16, 8, pp. 2129-2151, (2006); Amr S., Hussein H.E.D., Ramadan N., El-Shafai W., El-Hanafy W., El-Samie A., Fathi E., Chaotic encryption of ECG signals with a random Kernel approach, Menoufia J Electr Eng Res, 28, pp. 115-121, (2019); Atalay N.S., Dogan S., Tuncer T., Akbal E., Image encryption methods and algorithms, Dicle Univ Eng Fac J Eng, 10, 3, pp. 815-831, (2019); Atan O., Effects of variable-order passive circuit element in Chua circuit, Circ Syst Signal Process, 39, pp. 2293-2306, (2020); Azar A.T., Serranot F.E., Vaidyanathan S., Sliding mode stabilization and synchronization of fractional order complex chaotic and hyperchaotic systems, Mathematical Techniques of Fractional Order Systems, pp. 283-317, (2018); Bagheri A., Moghaddam J.J., Decoupled adaptive neuro-fuzzy (DANF) sliding mode control system for a Lorenz chaotic problem, Expert Syst Appl, 36, 3, pp. 6062-6068, (2009); Belmeguenai A., Ahmida Z., Ouchtati S., Dejmii R., A novel approach based on stream cipher for selective speech encryption, Int J Speech Technol, (2017); Cavusoglu U., Design and ımplementation of chaos based hybrid symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms (Doctoral thesis, unpublished), (2016); Chen C.K., Lin C.L., Chiang C.T., Lin S.L., Personalized information encryption using ECG signals with chaotic functions, Inf Sci, 193, pp. 125-140, (2012); Chua L.O., The genesis of Chua's circuit, (1992); Chua L.O., Wu C.W., Huang A., Zhong G.Q., A universal circuit for studying and generating chaos.

Based on the data of 40 listed companies in the industry chain from 2015 to 2019, the meta-frontier framework and three-stage epsilon based measure (EBM) model are employed to study the green technical efficiency (GTE) in each link of the industry chain and the technical gap between each link. The impact of the external environment on GTE, the main reasons hindering the development of GTE, and the ways to improve GTE are also discussed for policy reference. The results show that: (1) under the meta-frontier, the GTEs of the whole industry chain and the composed links are all high and rising year by year. (2) There are obvious green technological development gaps among the links of the industry chain. The GTEs are ranked as the upstream>the downstream>the midstream. (3) The inefficiencies of green technology (GTEI) in the upstream and downstream of the industry chain come from endogenous hindrance, while the GTEI of the midstream is due to exogenous hindrance. (4) The external environment has a significant influence on the development of GTE in the industrial chain. Highly open and innovative external environment can effectively reduce the input redundancy. (5) After eliminating the external influencing factors and random interferences, the actual GTE of the industrial chain is only 0.4 or so, with more serious imbalance among the three links. Therefore, it is important for the marine ship industry chain to optimize the allocation of innovation resources and cultivate an open and shared innovation environment.

However, the collapse of suspended structures and residues of sacrificial materials greatly restrict the application of this technology, especially for extremely narrow channel fabrication. In this paper, a 3D printing strategy named nanofiber self-consistent additive manufacturing (NSCAM) is proposed for integrated 3D microfluidic chip fabrication with porous nanofibers as supporting structures, which avoids the sacrificial layer release process. In the NSCAM process, electrospinning and electrohydrodynamic jet (E-jet) writing are alternately employed. The porous polyimide nanofiber mats formed by electrospinning are ingeniously applied as both supporting structures for the suspended layer and percolating media for liquid flow, while the polydimethylsiloxane E-jet writing ink printed on the nanofiber mats (named construction fluid in this paper) controllably permeates through the porous mats. After curing, the resultant construction fluid–nanofiber composites are formed as 3D channel walls. As a proof of concept, a microfluidic pressure-gain valve, which contains typical features of narrow channels and movable membranes, was fabricated, and the printed valve was totally closed under a control pressure of 45 kPa with a fast dynamic response of 52.6 ms, indicating the feasibility of NSCAM. Therefore, we believe NSCAM is a promising technique for manufacturing microdevices that include movable membrane cavities, pillar cavities, and porous scaffolds, showing broad applications in 3D microfluidics, soft robot drivers or sensors, and organ-on-a-chip systems.

However, due to the health concern of synthetic fiber usage, researchers are trying to find another viable alternative. A microperforated panel (MPP) is a promising alternative that relies on the concept of a Helmholtz resonator for sound absorption. MPP possessed excellent acoustic resistance and a considerable range of absorption bandwidth. In this paper, MPP made of natural fiber composite was fabricated and its acoustic absorption was measured using a two-microphone impedance tube method as per ISO 10534-2 standard. Later, the tensile strength of the fabricated acoustic absorbers was measured using an Instron Universal Testing Machine as per ASTM D638. The idea of employing additive manufacturing, better known as the 3D printing technique, is proposed to produce lightweight MPP. The 3D printing technique provides design freedom and is less tedious in creating complex and light structures. The 3D printing technique has various important parameters, and infill density is one of the parameters. It was found that the reduction of infill density leads to a decrease of the MPP's mass and thus, slightly affects the resonance frequency of the MPP, still within the mid-frequency spectrum. It was also noted that the increment of air gap thickness leads to the shifting of MPP's resonance frequency to a lower frequency range. The tensile strength of the 3D printed samples decreases with a decrease in infill density. A sample with an infill density of 100% has the highest tensile strength of 22 MPa, and a sample with an infill density of 20% has the lowest tensile strength of 12 MPa. © 2022 The Authors","Acoustics; Additive manufacturing; Light-weighted sound absorbers; Natural fiber composites; Two microphone impedance tube method","3D printers; Acoustic impedance; Acoustic wave absorption; Additives; Fabrication; Infill drilling; Microphones; Natural fibers; Natural frequencies; Sound insulating materials; Tensile testing; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Impedance tube methods; Light-weighted sound absorber; Microperforated panels; Natural fiber composites; Printing techniques; Sound absorber; Two microphone impedance tube method; Two microphones; Tensile strength","","","","","Taylor’s University, (TUFR/2017/001/05)","Funding text 1: The author is thankful to the Taylor’s University for funding scholarship during this research work.

However, such materials are often limited to 2D films or simple shapes and do not benefit from spatial tailoring of mechanical properties resulting from CNC alignment. Herein, we propose the direct ink writing (DIW) of 3D complex structures that combine CNC reinforcement effects with photoinduced responses. After grafting azobenzene photochromes onto the CNC surfaces, up to 15 wt % of modified nanoparticles can be introduced into a polyurethane acrylate matrix. The influence of CNC on rheological properties allows DIW of self-standing 3D structures presenting local shear-induced alignment of the active reinforcements. The printed composites, with longitudinal elastic modulus of 30 MPa, react to visible-light irradiation with 30-50% reversible softening and present a shape memory behavior. The phototunable energy absorption of 3D complex structures is demonstrated by harnessing both geometrical and photoresponsive effects, enabling dynamic mechanical responses to environmental stimuli. Functionalized CNC in 3D printable inks have the potential to allow the rapid prototyping of several devices with tailored mechanical properties, suitable for applications requiring dynamic responses to environmental changes. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

As such, it may serve as an option to in-house hardware and software. However, dynamic consolidation of VMs is required to improve power consumption, load balance, the frequency of migrations, Quality of Service (QoS), and the rate at which SLA violations are addressed, all of which contribute to better resource use. VM technology has quickly become a pillar of data centers and cluster systems because to its utility in partitioning, consolidating, and moving workloads. VM placement is another thing that affects the quality of consolidation. It is important to design a system that improves energy efficiency by allocating resources to applications in a smart way while still meeting QoS requirements for applications. Moreover, the security of information that is being processed during the migration process is also one of the important tasks. Hence, in this paper, review and analysis based on parameters and metrics for the VM migration under the influence of energy optimization, consolidation, and security have been investigated in a wider manner. Moreover, some open issues that are still prevalent in the current field have also been highlighted. © 2022","Cloud data center; Consolidation; Optimization; Service level agreement; Virtual machine","Cloud analytics; Cloud security; Energy efficiency; Green computing; Network security; Quality of service; Cloud computing services; Cloud data centers; Cloud-computing; Energy efficient; Optimisations; Optimization approach; Quality-of-service; Resources optimization; Servicelevel agreement (SLA); Virtual machine migrations; Virtual machine","","","","","","","Kumar M., Dubey K., Sharma S.C., Elastic and flexible deadline constraint load balancing algorithm for cloud computing, Procedia Comput.

For optimizing the RN, the work created a novel RN architecture with four separate modules. The infrastructure module allots disruption to the RN. The control system module defines whether the RN is disrupted or not utilizing the Gaussian Membership Function-based Fuzzy Decision Making (GMF-FDM) process. If it is interrupted, it is evaluated at the train service together with the passenger network, and the operational module is triggered. Two main operations are being executed by the operational module: (i) Improved Cockroach Swarm Optimization (ICSO) reroute the trains by means of ascertaining the shortest route, as well as (ii) Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) reschedule the train's timings in relation to the passenger. Based on train, passenger, along with station data, significant constraints were extracted, which were inputted to the Vulnerability Assessment (VA) module. In which, the chosen paths vulnerability is assessed by the proposed Enhanced Elman Deep Learning Neural Network (EEDLNN). An accuracy of 96.61% is obtained by the experimental outcome, which is better when weighed against the conventional methods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Enhanced elman deep learning neural network (EEDLNN);

In this paper, for the SHPB test of concrete, an efficient multi-scale mechanical calculation method based on coupling of discrete element method (DEM) and finite difference method (FDM) is proposed, and SHPB test system for analysis of the macroscopic and microscopic dynamic mechanical properties and damage evolution of concrete under impact loading is established by this coupling method. A three-phase mesoscopic scale model of concrete is constructed by DEM, and the crushability, real geometry-shape, and particle size distribution of aggregates are considered by combining 3D scanning technology and the “ball-clump-cluster” method. Meanwhile, FDM is adopted to simulate the SHPB model, and the “coupling wall” mechanism is applied to realize the signal transmission between the models. On this basis, the stress waves obtained by the direct monitoring method through numerical simulation are basically consistent with those obtained by the theoretical calculation method, which verifies the dynamic characteristics of the SHPB model. Finally, the different types of microcrack propagation are analyzed in the premise of examining the static and dynamic mechanical response of the concrete model. It was found that the distribution of mortar and aggregate microcracks on the outside of the concrete was significantly more than that on the inside due to transverse inertia force, and the superiority of the method in simulating the damage evolution behavior of concrete meso-structural is demonstrated. © 2022","Coupling DEM-FDM; Damage evolution; Dynamic mechanical behavior; Impact loading; SHPB","Bridge decks; Concrete aggregates; Concrete testing; Dynamics; Mechanical testing; Microcracks; Numerical methods; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Strain rate; Coupling discrete element method-finite difference method; Coupling methods; Damage evolution; Discrete elements method; Dynamic mechanical behavior; Finite-difference methods; Impact loadings; Multiscale modeling; Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar test; Split Hopkinson pressure bars; Finite difference method","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities of the Central South University","This paper gets its funding from project (No. 11790283) supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Central South University.

The repair process is composed of different steps, such as three-dimensional scanning, defect detection, pre-repair machining, material addition, post-repair finishing machining, and material testing. In this work, the steps of pre-repair machining and material addition of stainless steel (SS) 316L powder on SS316L substrate using LMD were studied. Three types of grooves with different opening angles (105°, 120°, and 135°) were machined. Both the substrate and the repaired parts were characterized to investigate the influence of the opening angles on the relative density, microstructure, and mechanical properties. As compared to the substrate, the repaired parts feature heterogeneous microstructure, a peak in microhardness in the heat-affected zone, similar ultimate tensile strength but low elongation at break for tensile tests, and reduced absorbed energy for Charpy impact tests. The decrease of the opening angle decreases the relative density and tensile properties but increases the energy absorption of the repaired parts. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Laser metal deposition; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Repair; Stainless steel 316L","Austenitic stainless steel; Charpy impact testing; Density (specific gravity); Deposition; Heat affected zone; Metals; Repair; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Laser metal deposition; Manufacturing techniques; Metal additives; Metal parts; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Opening angle; Relative density; Repair process; Stainless steel (316L); Three-dimensional scanning; Microstructure","","","","","Akram Alhussein; Pierre Wident and Bernard of the CEA; Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique et aux Énergies Alternatives, CEA; Université de Technologie de Troyes, UTT","This work was supported financially by the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA).

The reconstruction plate plays a key role in maintaining stability and load-sharing while the fibula unites with adjacent bone in the course of healing and remodeling. However, not all fibula flaps would fully unite, and fatigue of prosthetic devices has been recognized as one major concern for long-term load-bearing applications. This study aims to develop a numerical approach for predicting the fatigue life of the reconstruction plate by taking into account the effect of ongoing bone remodeling. Methods: The patient-specific mandible reconstruction with a prosthetic system is studied in this work. The 3D finite element model with heterogeneous material properties obtained from clinical computerized tomography (CT) data is developed for bone, and eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) is adopted for the fatigue analysis of the plate. During the remodeling process, the changing apparent density and Young's modulus of bone are simulated in a step-wise fashion on the basis of Wolff's law, which is correlated with the specific clinical follow-up. The maximum biting forces were considered as the driving force on the bone remodeling, which are measured clinically at different time points (4, 16 and 28 months) after reconstruction surgery. Results: Under various occlusal loadings, the interaction between fatigue crack growth and bone remodeling is investigated to gain new insights for the future design of prosthetic devices. The simulation results reveal that appropriate remodeling of grafted bone could extend the fatigue life of fixation plates in a positive way. On the other hand, the rising occlusal load associated with healing and remodeling could lead to fatigue fracture of fixation plate and potentially cause severe bone resorption. Conclusion: This study proposes an effective approach for more realistically predicting fatigue life of prosthetic devices subject to a tissue remodeling condition in-silico. It is anticipated to provide a guideline for deriving an optimal design of patient-specific prosthetic devices to better ensure longevity. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Biomechanics; Bone remodeling; Fatigue fracture; Mandibular reconstruction plate; XFEM","Bone Plates; Bone Remodeling; Fibula; Free Tissue Flaps; Humans; Mandible; Mechanical Phenomena; Bone; Computerized tomography; Elastic moduli; Finite element method; Fracture; Prosthetics; Three dimensional computer graphics; Bone remodelling; Fatigue fracture; Fixation plate; Mandibular reconstruction; Mandibular reconstruction plate; Patient specific; Prosthetic devices; Reconstruction plates; Time dependent; XFEM; Article; bone density; bone growth; bone remodeling; computer assisted tomography; computer model; controlled study; critical value; degree of freedom; extended finite element method; fibula graft; follow up; force; human; mandible reconstruction; muscle strength; osteolysis; periodontal ligament; reconstructive surgery; simulation; stress fracture; surface area; temporomandibular joint; three dimensional finite element analysis; Young modulus; bone remodeling; fibula; free tissue graft; mandible; mechanics; surgery; transplantation; Fatigue crack propagation","","","","","USydIS; Australian Research Council, ARC; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (19K10198); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS","The funding supports from Australian Research Council (ARC) is grateful.

Y-free and Y-added SLM Ni-based superalloy as two alloys for comparison. In the Y-added superalloy, the main reasons for the denser microstructure are a flat melt pool and epitaxial growth of columnar dendrites with <001> orientation. Moreover, the Y-added SLM specimens have superior hot tensile performance due to high density dislocation and the formation of Y2O3-oxides. Analysis of microstructural evolution under elevated temperatures showed that the interaction between dislocation and oxide could pin dislocation at the grain boundary and increase the annihilation temperature of dislocation. We also examined the high temperature fracture morphology of Y-added specimens, and found that their excellent performance is primarily because of tenacity nests and serpentine sliding originating from the oxide and dislocation, as well as their impediment to microvoid extension. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Fracture morphology; High temperature tensile strength","Fracture; Grain boundaries; Microstructural evolution; Morphology; Selective laser melting; Superalloys; Tensile strength; Columnar dendrites; Fracture morphology; High-temperature mechanical properties; High-temperature tensile strengths; Hot tensile; Melt pool; Ni-based superalloys; Selective laser melting; Tensile performance; Y addition; Nickel alloys","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52001334, 52074366, 91860105); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Central South University, CSU; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2021JJ40757); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province; State Key Laboratory of Powder Metallurgy, SKLPM; National Major Science and Technology Projects of China, (J2019-IV-0003-0070); National Major Science and Technology Projects of China; Science and Technology Program of Hunan Province, (2021RC3131); Science and Technology Program of Hunan Province","This work is supported by supported by National Science and Technology Major Project ( J2019-IV-0003-0070 ), the Natural Science Foundation of China ( 91860105 , 52074366 , 52001334 ), Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province of China ( 2021JJ40757 ), the Science and Technology Innovation Program of Hunan Province ( 2021RC3131 ), and Project Supported by State Key Laboratory of Powder Metallurgy, Central South University, Changsha, China .","Reed R.C., The Superalloys: Fundamentals and Applications, (2006); Pollock T.M., Tin S., Nickel-based superalloys for advanced turbine engines: chemistry, microstructure and properties, J.

When exposed to UV irradiation within the rheometer, the cured thickness of the photoresin is measured by lowering the upper plate while monitoring the commensurate axial force. The encoder-measured distance is correlated with axial force to measure cure depth under different UV curing conditions. This technique enables precise measurements of photocured films thinner than 50 µm, which can then be used to establish working curve equations for photopolymerization-based additive manufacturing (AM) processes. This process is validated through the evaluation of three unique photoresins, including a commercially available VP stiff photoresin, a highly-viscous photoresin that cures into a “soft” gel, and a highly solids-loaded photoresin with particles that greatly limit maximum cure depth. In addition, the technique is employed to explore the impact of UV irradiance on curing behavior of photoresins. This technique enables measurement of AM process-relevant cure depths with process-relevant irradiance and wavelengths and has applications in advanced material development for a range of AM and traditional UV processing technologies. This technique meets identified gaps in current cure depth characterization techniques, including the need for automated instrumental approaches to reduce human error in measurements, the need to directly measure cure depths less than 150 µm, and the need to measure curing behavior at different UV irradiances/wavelengths. Due to the non-linear cure depth versus exposure behavior of some photoresins, it is important to directly measure cure depths at AM process-relevant sizes ( µm), as a working curve made from measurements of thicker films leads to more inaccurate predictions than those made from measuring thinner films. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Direct ink write; Inkjet printing; Jacobs’ equation; Material jetting; Photocuring; Photopolymer; Photorheology; SLA; Stereolithography; Ultraviolet curing; UV-DIW; Vat photopolymerization; VP; Working curve","Additives; Curing; Irradiation; Photopolymerization; Photopolymers; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Direct ink write; Ink-jet printing; Jacobs equation; Material jetting; Photo polymerization; Photocuring; Photorheology; SLA; Ultraviolet curing; Ultraviolet-curing; Ultraviolet-DIW; Vat photopolymerization; VP; Working curve; 3D printers","","","","","Army Research Lab, (W911NF2020052); Diana Israel; Macromolecules Innovation Institute; Office of the Vice President for Research and Innovation; Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, VT; Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science, ICTAS","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Army Research Lab , Contract # W911NF2020052 .

In this paper, we propose an algorithm for estimating both the oxidising and reducing potential of electrolytes using molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry techniques. This algorithm can help to determine the composition and structure of the solvate complexes formed when a salt is dissolved in a mixture of solvents. To develop and confirm the efficiency of the algorithm, LiBF4 solutions in binary mixtures of ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and sulfolane (SL)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) were studied. The structure and composition of the complexes formed in these systems were determined according to molecular dynamics. Quantum chemical estimation of the thermodynamic and oxidative stability of solvate complexes made it possible to establish which complexes make the most significant contribution to the electrochemical stability of the electrolyte system. This method can also be used to determine the additive value of the oxidation and reduction potentials of the electrolyte, along with the contribution of each complex to the overall stability of the electrolyte. Theoretical calculations were confirmed experimentally in the course of studying electrolytes by step-by-step polarisation using inert electrodes. Thus, the main aim of the study is to demonstrate the possibility of using the developed algorithm to select the optimal composition and solvent ratio to achieve predicted redox stability. © 2022 by the authors.","cationic and anionic complexes; liquid electrolytes; lithium-ion batteries; molecular dynamics; quantum chemical calculations; redox stability of complexes","Binary mixtures; Carbonation; Cathodes; Chemical stability; Electrolytes; Ethylene; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Quantum chemistry; Anionic complex; Cationic complexes; Dimethyl carbonate; Electrochemical stabilities; Liquid electrolytes; Quantum chemical calculations; Quantum-chemical calculation; Redox stability; Redox stability of complex; Solvate complexes; Molecular dynamics","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (22-23-00846)","This research was funded by Russian Science Foundation, grant number 22-23-00846 “Prediction of the stability of lithium-conducting electrolytes”.","Choi J., Aurbach D., Promise and Reality of Post-Lithium-Ion Batteries with High Energy Densities, Nat.

The dimension of the deposited part is one of the important factors influencing the heat accumulation and dissipation. In this work, the effect of sample size on the LAAM-built β-titanium Ti-13.3Mo-7.2Al–4Zr-0.25Ni (wt.%) was investigated. The results demonstrate that the vertical sample with smaller cross-section area has larger grain size than the horizontal sample with larger cross-section area. In addition, three types of secondary phases, i.e., Ti3Al, Ti2Ni and TiNi, are formed in the vertical sample due to thermal accumulation caused by the smaller cross-section area. The formation of the secondary phases leads to higher Vickers hardness and brittle failure of the vertical sample. However, the horizontal sample with no secondary phase demonstrates excellent combination of high yield strength (923 MPa) and low elastic modulus (68.7 GPa), which is beneficial for structural and biomedical application. Furthermore, the low modulus is mainly ascribed to the crystallographic texture along <001> direction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Crystallographic texture; Elastic modulus; Laser aided additive manufacturing; Phase constituents; β-Ti alloy","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Medical applications; Nickel alloys; Textures; Titanium alloys; Vickers hardness; Zircaloy; Additive manufacturing process; Cross-section area; Crystallographic textures; Laser aided additive manufacturing; Phase constituent; Phase formations; Secondary phase; Thermal history; Ti alloys; β Ti alloy; Elastic moduli","","","","","Academy of Sciences Project of Guangdong Province, (2016GDASRC-0105); Xi'an University of Technology, XUT, (101-256082204); Xi'an University of Technology, XUT; Education Department of Shaanxi Province, (22JK0479); Education Department of Shaanxi Province","This research was supported by Academy of Sciences Project of Guangdong Province (No. 2016GDASRC-0105 ), Scientific Research Program Funded by Shaanxi Provincial Education Department (Program No. 22JK0479 ) and Research Start-up Project of Xi'an University of Technology (Grant No. 101-256082204 ).","Chew Y., Zhu Z.G., Weng F., Gao S.B., Ng F.L., Lee B.Y., Bi G.J., J.

Arbitrary, real-time manipulation of these parameters at the micron scale would further provide cellular biologists and bioengineers with the tools to study and control numerous highly dynamic behaviors including cellular adhesion, motility, metastasis, and differentiation. Although physical, chemical, thermal, and light-based strategies have been developed to influence Young's modulus and topography of hydrogel substrates, independent control of these physical attributes has remained elusive, spatial resolution is often limited, and features commonly must be pre-patterned. We recently reported a strategy in which biomaterials having specified three-dimensional (3D) morphologies are micro-3D printed in a two-step process: laser-scanning bioprinting of a protein-based hydrogel, followed by biocompatible hydrogel re-scanning to create microscale imprinted features at user-defined times. In this approach, a pulsed near-infrared laser beam is focused within the printed hydrogel to promote matrix contraction through multiphoton crosslinking, where scanning the laser focus projects a user-defined topographical pattern on the surface without subjecting the hydrogel-solution interface to damaging light intensities. Here, we extend this strategy, demonstrating the ability to decouple dynamic topographical changes from changes in hydrogel Young's modulus at the substrate surface by increasing the isolation distance between the surface and re-scanning planes. Using atomic force microscopy, we show that robust topographic changes can be imposed without altering the Young's modulus measured at the substrate surface by scanning at a depth of greater than ∼6 μm. Transmission electron microscopy of hydrogel thin sections reveals changes to hydrogel porosity and density distribution within scanned regions, and that such changes to the hydrogel matrix are highly localized to regions of laser exposure. These results represent valuable new capabilities for deconvolving the effects of substrate dynamic physical attributes on the behavior of adherent cells. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic; Hydrogel; Imprinting; Multiphoton; Topography; Young's modulus","hydrogel; Article; geographic and geological phenomena; human; scanning electron microscopy; three-dimensional imaging; transmission electron microscopy","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R21GM131349); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS; Welch Foundation, (F-1331); Welch Foundation","This work was supported by the Robert A.

Studies during the surfacing of the first bead on the plate were carried out under the conditions of the established mode of non-pulse jet transfer at reverse polarity and various surfacing rates. Correlation interactions are studied, and mathematical dependences are obtained to describe the relationship between the process parameters and the bead geometry. It is shown that the geometric parameters will change along the length of the bead and, moreover, depending on the deposition rate, which must be taken into account when designing the WAAM process. For an element of the “cooling fin wall with variable height section” type in the manufacture of a preform, the correlation relationships of the geometry and process parameters were studied under the conditions of the actual layer-by-layer variable surfacing mode, the sensitivity of the output parameters to the process parameters was studied, the sensitivity coefficients were determined, and mathematical models were constructed for predicting and deviating the output parameters from the deviations of the input ones. The article shows and substantiates the compensatory nature of the effect of changing the magnitude of the current and speed on the geometric parameters of the beads, which can be used in the design and control of the WAAM process. For the main design tasks, a number of exploratory design procedures for WAAM are proposed that best organize the design process, as well as their formalized rules based on mathematical models. The rules for choosing the initial setting point for the process of direct supply of energy and material are considered, taking into account changes in the geometry of the beads along their length. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Aluminum alloy;

The emphasis of this research is placed on Laser Directed Energy Deposition via Powder Feeding (LDED-PF). The primary benefit of using a magnetic levitation system for AM applications is that the levitated geometry is expected to be a portion of the final part manufactured, thus eliminating the need for a substrate and reducing the post-processing operation requirement. Two novel levitation systems were designed, optimized, and manufactured. The design, optimization, and analysis were first conducted in the simulation environment using ANSYS Maxwell and then tested with experiments. The newly developed systems depicted a much-improved performance compared to the first prototype developed in a previous article written by the authors. The newly developed systems had an increase in levitation height, the surface area for powder deposition activities, the time available for AM operations, and the ability to support additional mass within the limits of allowable inputs. The compatibility of the levitation system with AM applications was also verified by testing the impact of powder deposition and the ability of the levitated disc to support added mass as a function of time with minimal loss in performance. This article also highlights the development of a novel feedback PID controller for the levitation system. To improve the overall performance of the controller, a feedforward controller was added in conjunction with the PID controller. Finally, the levitation system was shown to highlight control over levitation height and maintain constant levitation height with the addition of an added mass using the feedback controller. © 2022 by the authors.","direct energy deposition; eddy current; laminated core; magnetic levitation; metal additive manufacturing","","","","","","; Canada Foundation for Innovation, CFI","This work was by the umbrella of the Holistic Innovation in Additive Manufacturing (HI-AM) Network through the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI).","Okress E., Wroughton D., Comenetz G., Brace P., Kelly J., Electromagnetic levitation of solid and molten metals, J.

To this end, pastes with controlled rheology and a total solid content of ∼42% are formulated. Constituents of the pastes are commercial graphite and cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) powder, as a dispersing additive, with 91:09 and 88:12 graphite:cellulose wt.% compositions. The AM structures are dried in air at three rates (slow, medium, and fast). The structure of printed parts is characterized using electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Infrared/X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray micro-computed tomography, and thermogravimetric analysis. The compressive strength of AM graphite structures reached 5.8±0.6 MPa with almost no effect from drying rates. However, samples containing more cellulose were ∼30% stronger in compression. Carbonization of the AM parts increased their electrical conductivity by more than an order of magnitude to ∼2400 S.m−1. In addition, it enabled the fabrication of nearly pure graphite structures. The mechanical and electrical properties of samples fabricated in this study exceed the performance of previously reported AM graphite structures. Moreover, the recyclability of the printed parts was demonstrated by regenerating pastes via mixing printed parts in water and re-printing new parts with the paste. The AM graphite structures can be used in numerous applications, including but not limited to electrical discharge machining (EDM), electrochemical machining (ECM), high-temperature customized sealing, high-temperature composite tooling, and energy conversion and storage. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Cellulose; Direct ink write; Graphite; Low energy; Recyclable; Sustainability","","","","","","","","Hakansson K.M.O., Henriksson I.C., de la Pena Vazquez C., Kuzmenko V., Markstedt K., Enoksson P., Gatenholm P., Solidification of 3D Printed Nanofibril Hydrogels into Functional 3D Cellulose Structures, Adv.

This study proposed a novel 3D titanium lattice-like implant for mandibular injuries based on simulation model, which is designed and optimized by a biomechanical/mechanobiological approach, and the working framework for optimal design and preparation processes of the implant has been validated to tailored to specific patient biomechanical, physiological and clinical requirements. Methods: This objective has been achieved by matching and assembling different morphologies of a lattice-like implant mimicking cancellous and cortical bone morphologies and properties, namely, an internal spongy trabecular-like structure that can be filled with bone graft materials and an external grid-like structure that can ensure the mechanical bearing capacity. Finite element analysis has been applied to evaluate the stress/strain distribution of the implant and bone graft materials under physiological loading conditions to determine whether and where the implant needs to be optimized. A topological optimization approach was employed to improve biomechanical and mechanobiological properties by adjusting the overall/local structural design of the implant. Results: The computational results demonstrated that, on average, values of the maximum von-Mises stress in the implant model nodes could be decreased by 43.14% and that the percentage of optimal physiological strains in the bone graft materials can be increased from 35.79 to 93.36% since early regeneration stages. Metal additive manufacturing technology was adopted to prepare the 3D lattice-like implant to verify its feasibility for fabrication. Following the working framework proposed in this study, the well-designed customized implants have both excellent biomechanical and mechanobiological properties, avoiding mechanical failure and providing sufficient biomechanical stimuli to promote new bone regeneration. Conclusion: This study is expected to provide a scientific and feasible clinical strategy for repairing large injuries of mandibular bone defects by offering new insights into design criteria for regenerative implants.

The helical gear system was modeled with a pair of helical gears, a shaft, a bearing, and a circular plate. The aerodynamic torque by the wind speed caused axial excitation of the helical gear system. Noise from the helical gear system by the axial excitation of helical gears was analyzed. As a result, the fixed speed wind turbine caused both the gear force and the sound pressure level of the gear system to fluctuate. The sound pressure was highly related to the first harmonic component of gear force. Magnesium plate had a greater sound pressure level than aluminum and steel plate in many frequency ranges. The increase of the helix angle increased the shaft force and decreased the mesh stiffness, the natural frequency, the peaks of gear displacement and sound pressure level of the gear system. Acoustic design sensitivity of the helical gear system was analytically proposed and was validated by FDM. As for acoustic design sensitivity, the shaft diameter and plate thickness greatly affected the sound pressure, but the shaft length had little effect on sound pressure. © 2022, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Design sensitivity; Gearbox; Helical gears; Noise; Wind turbine","Acoustic noise; Acoustic variables measurement; Acoustic wave transmission; Helical gears; Turbine components; Wind; Acoustics design; Axial excitation; Design sensitivity; Gear system; Gearbox; Helical gear systems; Noise; Noise characteristic; Sound pressures; Sound pressures level; Wind turbines","","","","","Gangneung-Wonju National University, GWNU","This study was supported by Gangneung-Wonju National University.","Manwell J.F., McGowan J.G., Rogers A.L., Wind Energy Explained: Theory, Design and Application, pp. 91-123, (2010); Qin D., Wang J., Lim T.C., Flexible multibody dynamic modelling of a horizontal wind turbine drivetrain system, Trans. of the ASME J.

However, applying 4D printing to ceramics remains challenging due to their intrinsic brittleness and inadequate stimuli-responsive ability. Here, this work proposes a conceptional combination of bioinspired microstructure design and a programmable prestrain approach for 4D printing of nanoceramics. To overcome the flexibility limitation, the bioinspired concentric cylinder structure in the struts of 3D printed lattices are replicated to develop origami nanoceramic composites with high inorganic content (95 wt%). Furthermore, 4D printing is achieved by applying a programmed prestrain to the printed lattices, enabling the desired deformation when the prestrain is released. Due to the bioinspired concentric cylinder microstructures, the printed flexible nanoceramic composites exhibit superior mechanical performance and anisotropic thermal management capability. Further, by introducing oxygen vacancies to the ceramic nanosheets, conductive nanoceramic composites are prepared with a unique sensing capability for various sensing applications. Hence, this research breaks through the limitation of ceramics in 4D printing and achieves high-performance shape morphing materials for applications under extreme conditions, such as space exploration and high-temperature systems. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","4D printing; bioinspired microstructures; flexible nanoceramic composites; programmed prestrain","Anisotropy; Printing, Three-Dimensional; 3D printers; Cylinders (shapes); High temperature applications; Microstructure; Space research; 4d printing; Bioinspired microstructure; Concentric cylinders; Flexible nanoceramic composite; Nanoceramic composites; Pre-strain; Programmed prestrain; Responsive materials; Shape change; Three-dimensional (3D) printing; anisotropy; three dimensional printing; Fracture mechanics","","","","","Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE, (WBS A‐0009123‐01‐00); Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE","T.L. and Q.L. contributed equally to this work.

Planar structures have more advantages over other forms studied to date due to their easy manufacturability. Metal-insulator-metal-based structures are one of the known methods to fabricate structural colors where colors can be tuned mainly by the thickness of the intermediate lossless insulator layer. However, generating colors by MIM structure requires a thin metallic layer on top, and the top metals' abrasiveness and/or oxidation may degrade the colors quickly. Thus, we propose a lossy dielectric layer to replace the top metallic layer as a solution to ensure the structure's durability by preventing scratches and oxidation. Herein, CrON/Si3N4/Metal structures have been studied where theoretical investigations suggest that highly saturated colors can be generated in the lossy-lossless dielectric structures. Experimental data validated such simulations by revealing a range of vivid colors. Furthermore, these structures can easily achieve strong light absorption (SLA) even for a thick top layer of ∼100 nm. The colors realized by these structures are appeared due to a combination of the interference effect of the asymmetric Fabry-Perot cavity structure and the absorption rate in the CrO x N1-x layer.  © 2022 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.","Fabry-Perot cavity; lossy dielectric; reflection colors; strong light absorption; structural colors","Fabry-Perot interferometers; Fiber optic sensors; Light absorption; Metal insulator boundaries; Metals; MIM devices; Semiconductor insulator boundaries; Cavity structure; Color adjustments; Fabry-Perot cavity; Lossy dielectrics; Reflection color; Strong light absorption; Structural color; Surface decoration; Surface optical; Tunable properties; Color","","","","","National Research Council of Science & Technology of the Republic of Korea, (CAP-16-10-KIMS); Korea Institute of Science and Technology, KIST, (2E31751, 2N61840, 2N66610); Korea Institute of Science and Technology, KIST","Research funding: Present work was supported by the Korea Institute of Science and Technology [grant numbers 2N61840, 2E31751 and 2N66610] and the R&D convergence program of the National Research Council of Science & Technology of the Republic of Korea [grant number CAP-16-10-KIMS].

The evolution of temperature during AM processes such as direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) has a considerable effect on residual stresses and thus undesired distortions in the parts. Therefore, the development of a fast and reliable simulation tool is essential to predict residual stresses and resulting distortions so that preventive actions including effective support design or building in a different direction can be taken. Although researchers have been studying for more than a decade to understand and model the complex physical phenomena involved in the DMLS process, the solutions provided in the literature are not fully applicable to the industrial problems due to long computational time. This study introduces an analytical approach and a multi-physics based finite element modeling (FEM) approach for rapid estimation of the residual stresses and distortions of the parts encountered in the DMLS process. The modeling approach incorporates the features of plasticity and hardening mechanism into the FEM environment. FEM simulation results on residual stress and distortions are validated by experimental measurements on Inconel 625 and presented in the article. The simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental measurement within a range of 0.2–9% error. In addition, four different freeform geometries are selected to investigate the prediction and computational performance of the developed model. The simulation results are in line with the experimental measurements for the freeform geometries within a range of 12–24% error. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to German Academic Society for Production Engineering (WGP).","Additive manufacturing; Deformation; Finite element analysis; Inconel 625; Residual stress","3D printers; Additives; Finite element method; Forecasting; Laser heating; Sintering; Assembly process; Direct metal laser sintering; Element models; Finite element analyse; Freeform geometry; Inconel 625; Manufacturing IS; Manufacturing process; Modeling approach; Sintering process; Residual stresses","","","","","TEI; TUSAŞ","The authors would like to thank TEI, TUSAŞ Engine Industries, Inc. for supporting the research.","Additive manufacturing-general principles-terminology, ASTM F2792-10E1, (2015); Levy G.N., Schindel R., Kruth J.P., Rapid manufacturing and rapid tooling with layer manufacturing (lm) technologies, state of the art and future perspectives, CIRP Ann Manuf Technol, 52, 2, pp. 589-609, (2003); Huang Y., Leu M.C., Mazumder J., Donmez A., Additive manufacturing: current state, future potential, gaps and needs, and recommendations, ASME J Manuf Sci Eng, 137, 1, (2015); Mercelis P., Kruth J.P., Residual stresses in selective laser sintering and selective laser melting, Rapid Prototyping J, 12, 5, pp. 254-265, (2006); Safronov V.A., Khmyrov R.S., Kotoban D.V., Gusarov A.V., Distortions and residual stresses at layer-by-layer additive manufacturing by fusion, ASME J Manuf Sci Eng, 139, 3, (2016); Huang Y., Khamesee M.B., Toyserkani E., A comprehensive analytical model for laser powder-fed additive manufacturing, Additive Manuf, 12, pp. 90-99, (2016); Kushan M.C., Poyraz O., Uzunonat Y., Orak S., Systematical review on the numerical simulations of laser powder bed additive manufacturing, Sigma J Eng Natural Sci, 36, (2018); Li Y., Dongdong G., Parametric analysis of thermal behavior during selective laser melting additive manufacturing of aluminum alloy powder, Mater Des, 63, pp. 856-867, (2014); Cheng B., Chou K., Melt pool evolution study in selective laser melting, Proceedings of the Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium, pp. 1182-1194, (2015); Andreotta R., Ladani L., Brindley W., Finite element simulation of laser additive melting and solidification of Inconel 718 with experimentally tested thermal properties, Finite Elem Anal Des, 135, pp. 36-43, (2017); Kundakcioglu E., Lazoglu I., Poyraz O., Yasa E., Cizicioglu N., Thermal and molten pool model in selective laser melting process of Inconel 625, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, (2018); Irwin J., Michaleris P.P., A line heat input model for additive manufacturing, ASME J Manuf Sci Eng, 138, 11, (2016); Ding J., Colegrove P., Mehnen J., Ganguly S., Sequeira Almeida P.M., Wang F., Williams S., Thermo-mechanical analysis of wire and arc additive layer manufacturing process on large multi-layer parts, Comput Mater Sci, 50, 12, pp. 3315-3322, (2011); Poyraz O., Kushan M.C., Residual stress-induced distortions in laser powder bed additive manufacturing of nickel-based superalloys, Strojniski Vestnik J Mech Eng, 65, (2019); Loh L.E., Chua C.K., Yeong W.Y., Song J., Mapar M., Sing S.L., Zhang D.Q., Et al., Numerical investigation and an effective modelling on the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process with aluminium alloy 6061, Int J Heat Mass Transf, 80, pp. 288-300, (2015); Patil N., Pal D., Khalid Rafi H., Zeng K., Moreland A., Hicks A., Stucker B., Et al., A generalized feed forward dynamic adaptive mesh refinement and derefinement finite element framework for metal laser sintering—part I: formulation and algorithm development, J Manuf Sci Eng, 137, (2015); Denlinger E.R., Michaleris P., Effect of stress relaxation on distortion in additive manufacturing process modeling, Additive Manuf, 12, pp. 51-59, (2016); Lu J., Prestress Engineering of Structural Material: A Global Design Approach to the Residual Stress Problem, pp. 11-26, (2002); Wang Z., Denlinger E., Michaleris P., Stoica A.D., Ma D., Beese A.M., Residual stress mapping in Inconel 625 fabricated through additive manufacturing: Method for neutron diffraction measurements to validate thermomechanical model predictions, Mater Des, 113, pp. 169-177, (2017)","Ö.

Material microstructure images were collected for our research, and micro-hardness tests were conducted to label the extracted microstructure images. In recent years, researchers have used machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to predict material properties for forming, machining, additive manufacturing, and other processes. However, they encountered industrial limitations primarily because of the absence of historical information on new and unknown materials, which are necessary to predict material properties by DL models. These problems can be solved by employing CNN models. In our work, we used a CNN model with two convolutional layers and visual geometry group (VGG19) as transfer learning (TL). We predicted four classes of micro-hardness of the St37 rolled threads. The prediction results of the micro-hardness test images by our proposed CNN model and pre-trained VGG19 model are comparable. Our proposed model has produced the same precision and recall scores as VGG19 for class B and class C hardness. VGG19 performed slightly better than our model for precision in class A and recall in class D. We observed that the training time of our proposed model using the CPU (central processing unit) was approximately nine times faster than the VGG19 model. Our proposed CNN and VGG19 have direct applications in advanced manufacturing (AM). They can automatically predict the micro-hardness in the thread rolling of St37. Our proposed model requires less memory and computational power and can be deployed more efficiently than the VGG19 model. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Machine learning; Mechanical properties; Metallography; Micro-hardness; Microstructure","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Forecasting; Learning systems; Metallography; Microstructure; Nondestructive examination; Program processors; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Learning models; Machine-learning; Micro-hardness; Microhardness tests; Neural network learning; Neural network model; Nondestructive methods; Transfer learning; Microhardness","","","","","Artificial Intelligence in Physics and Engineering; Northeastern University","I have always immensely benefited from Professor Sergey Kravchenko’s academic support at Northeastern University, Department of Physics in the United States of America, and I would like to express my sincere appreciation and most profound gratitude for his academic support and encouragement in particular in the application of Artificial Intelligence in Physics and Engineering.

Due to high thermal conductivities and high reflectivity of infrared laser irradiation, it is still challenging to fabricate copper alloys using the LPBF technique. To address the issue, a short wavelength laser (515 nm) was employed in the LPBF process. In this work, the CuCrZr alloys were built with optimized building parameters such as powder of 485 W, scanning speed of 400 mm/s, and hatching distance of 0.09 mm. The relative density of the samples was found to be 98.07 %. The as-built samples exhibit good mechanical properties with ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 447 ± 13 MPa, yield strength (YS) of 400 ± 11 MPa, total failure elongation (EL) of 10 ± 3 %, and Vickers hardness of 130 ± 15 HV). However, the electrical property is poor with 30 ± 1 %IACS. The high tensile stress and low electrical conductivity may attribute to the dislocation cells. Moreover, the dissolved Cr atoms result in poor conductivity. By direct aging treatment at 500 °C for 1 h, excellent mechanical properties (UTS = 566 ± 18 MPa, YS = 487 ± 13 MPa, EL = 15 ± 1 %, Vickers hardness = 161 ± 15 HV) were achieved while maintaining a good conductivity (64 ± 3 % IACS). The main contribution to the increase in YS is attributed to (I) the nanoscale Cr precipitated homogeneously in the copper matrix during the direct aging treatment and (II) the remaining high dislocation density near the dislocation cells. The enhancement of the electrical conductivity is attributed to the decomposition of the supersaturated solid solution. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Electrical properties; Green laser; Laser powder bed fusion; Precipitate hardening; Ultra-tensile strength","Chromium; Chromium alloys; Copper alloys; Electric conductivity; Fabrication; High strength alloys; Metallic matrix composites; Tensile strength; Ternary alloys; Zircaloy; Cu-Cr-Zr alloys; Electrical conductivity; Green laser; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; Precipitate hardening; Ultimate tensile strength; Ultra-tensile strength; Vicker hardness; Vickers hardness","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51201107); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, LOCT, (2018GZKF03007); State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, LOCT; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFB0306405); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFB0306405 ), the State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks (Grant No. 2018GZKF03007 ), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51201107 ).

Lauterbur Research Center for Biomedical Imaging, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, 518055, China","Sieving specific particles from mixed samples is of great value in fields such as biochemistry and additive manufacturing. In this study, a particle sieving method for microfluidics was proposed based on a phononic crystal plate (PCP), the mechanism of which originates from the competition between the trapping effect of the resonant PCP-induced acoustic radiation force (ARF), disturbance effect of acoustic streaming (AS), and flushing effect of the continuous inlet flow on particles suspended in microfluidic channels. Specifically, particles with different sizes could be separated under inlet flow conditions owing to ARF and AS drag forces as functions of the particle diameter, incident acoustic pressure, and driving frequency. Furthermore, a comprehensive numerical analysis was performed to investigate the impacts of ARF, AS, and inlet flow conditions on the particle motion and sieving efficiency, and to explore proper operating parameters, including the acoustic pressure and inlet flow velocity. It was found that, for each inlet flow velocity, there was an optimal acoustic pressure allowing us to achieve the maximum sieving efficiency, but the sieving efficiency at a low flow velocity was not as good as that at a high flow velocity. Although a PCP with a high resonant frequency could weaken the AS, thereby suiting the sieving of small particles (<5 μm), a low channel height corresponding to a high frequency limits the throughput. Therefore, it is necessary to design a PCP with a suitable resonant frequency based on the size of the particles to be sieved. This investigation can provide guidance for the design of massive acoustic sorting mi-crofluidic devices based on phononic crystals or acoustic metamaterials under continuous flow. © 2022 by the authors.","acoustic radiation force; acoustic streaming; microfluidics; particle sorting; phononic crystal","Acoustic emissions; Acoustic radiators; Acoustic streaming; Acoustic wave propagation; Acoustic wave transmission; Drag; Efficiency; Flow velocity; Inlet flow; Microfluidics; Particle size analysis; Phonons; Screening; Acoustic inlets; Acoustic pressures; Acoustic radiation force; Continuous-flow; Flow condition; Inlet flow velocity; Mixed samples; Particle sorting; Phononic Crystal; Phononic-crystal plate; Natural frequencies","","","","","Shenzhen Basic Research Program, (JCYJ20200109114825064); Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Ultrasound Imaging and Therapy, (ZDSYS201802061806314); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11874381, 11974372, 12074402, 81927808); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, (GJHZ20210705141404012); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2020YFA0908800)","This work was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant no. 2020YFA0908800), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 81927808, 12074402, 11974372, and 11874381), Shenzhen Basic Research Program (no.

Hydrogels can meet these features and can mimic the microenvironment of soft tissues easily. Hydrocolloids are a group of hydrogels which have a suitable gelling capacity and rheological properties. According to the literature, polysaccharide-based hydrocolloids are used in the food industry, wound healing technologies, and tissue engineering. Quince seed hydrocolloids (QSHs), which consist of mostly glucuronoxylan, can easily be obtained from quince seeds by water extraction. In this study, the use of a QSH as a bio-ink was investigated. The suitability of QSH for the printing process was assessed by rheological, uniformity and pore factor analyses. Appropriate printing parameters were determined and the characterization of the bioprinted QSHs was performed by SEM analysis, water uptake capacity measurement, and protein adsorption assay. The bioprinted QSHs had excellent water uptake capacity and showed suitable protein adsorption behaviour. Analyses of the biocompatibility and cellular viability of bioprinted QSHs were conducted using NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells and the results were found to be high during short and long-term cell culture periods. It was proved that QSH is a highly promising bio-ink for 3D bioprinting and further tissue engineering applications.","","Bioprinting; Colloids; Hydrogels; Ink; Water; ink; water; bioprinting; colloid; hydrogel; procedures","","water, 7732-18-5; Colloids, ; Hydrogels, ; Water, ","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","20474849","","","36278818","English","Biomater Sci","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142918777"

Heat accumulation phenomena caused by successive layer deposition strongly affect the microstructure and properties of components created with LAM. This study presents the conditions for component joining of constant process parameters and laser power gradient reduction process parameters to compare and investigate the influence of heat accumulation on the uniformity of mechanical properties and microstructure. The effects of the thermal cycle curve in different zones during LAM on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the top, middle and bottom of the deposition zone (DZ) under various parameters were investigated through finite element simulation and experiment. Results indicated that the cooling speed at the top of the DZ is slow and the heat accumulation effect is high. The aspect ratio of the α phase at the top of the deposition zone is high and high heat accumulation deteriorates mechanical properties. The heat accumulation effect is weakened when the gradient process parameters are used for joining. The content and size of the α phase at different joint heights are further homogenized. The tensile strength difference at various positions decreases and is higher than the tensile strength of the joint under constant parameters. This study promotes the LAM technology and provides a control reference for heat accumulation and microstructure regulation of large-thickness Ti6Al4V titanium alloy joints fabricated by LAM. © 2022","Directed energy deposition; Heat accumulation; Laser additive manufacturing; Microstructure; Ti6Al4V titanium alloy","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Aspect ratio; Deposition; Joining; Tensile strength; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Deposition zone; Directed energy; Directed energy deposition; Energy depositions; Heat accumulation; Heat accumulation effects; Laser additive manufacturing; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Process parameters; Ti6al4v titanium alloys; Microstructure","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51975285); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the project from the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51975285 ).","Akerfeldt P., Antti M.L., Pederson R., Influence of microstructure on mechanical properties of laser metal wire-deposited Ti-6A1–4 V, Mater.

However, composition segregation is still challenging in the field of in-situ TWAAM. To homogenize the chemical composition, here we proposed a novel single droplet pre-alloying transfer mode of TWAAM based on the original droplet transfer mode of double wires directly fed into the molten pool. The designed nominal composition of Ti-25Al-23Nb was set as the target alloy. The as-printed parts were investigated systematically. The results showed that this unique droplet transfer mode could not only improve the forming accuracy but also effectively mitigate the composition segregation. In addition, the inconsistency of microstructure caused by the composition segregation was successfully solved by this mode and appears a fully lamellar microstructure. The improvement of composition uniformity played a positive role in enhancing the mechanical properties of the alloy, in which the tensile strength of room and high temperature were improved by 76.8% and 74.1% respectively compared with our previous research. This work is of great significance to alleviate the composition segregation of intermetallics and further promote the in-situ TWAAM fabrication of Ti2AlNb-based alloys. © 2022","Composition segregation; Droplet transfer mode; Mechanical property; Ti<sub>2</sub>AlNb-based alloy; Twin-wire arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Drops; Fabrication; Microstructure; Tensile strength; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Wire; Additive manufacturing technology; Cast and wrought; Composition segregation; Droplet transfer; Droplet transfer mode; In-situ fabrication; Ti2alnb-based alloy; Transfer modes; Twin-wire arc additive manufacturing; Wire arc; Niobium alloys","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51875041, 51875042); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51875041 , 51875042 ).

However, these silica CCs are highly limited by their high temperature softening and inevitable anisotropy. In this work, silica-based CCs reinforced by alumina powders are manufactured by 3D printing via digital light processing (DLP) stereolithography, and the anisotropy in microstructure and property was investigated. In the CC without alumina powders, multilayer structures with significant interlayer gaps are exhibited in horizontal printing direction suggesting significant anisotropy in microstructure, which is related to the particle deposition in printing. As the alumina content is 6 wt%, microstructures become uniform, due to the enhanced particle rearrangement between different layers. To assess the mechanical anisotropy, the ratio of vertical strength to horizontal strength (σV/σH) is raised, and the σV/σH ratios rise from 0.45 to 0.86 at room temperature and 0.52–0.89 at 1540 °C with increasing alumina content from 0 to 6 wt%. As the alumina content is 6 wt%, the CC exhibits high temperature flexure strengths as high as 17.9 MPa and 19.5 MPa in different directions, well satisfying the demands for turbine blades casting. This article inspires a profound understanding on the anisotropy control in 3D printing of CC with excellent high-temperature mechanical properties. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Alumina; Anisotropy; Ceramic cores; DLP stereolithography; High-temperature property; Silica","3D printers; Aircraft engines; Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Anisotropy; Ceramic materials; Microstructure; Powders; Reinforcement; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Alumina content; Alumina powder; Ceramic core; Digital light processing; Digital light processing stereolithography; High-temperature properties; Silica-based ceramics; Turbine blade; Silica","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52102062); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (CHD300102312406); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant No. 52102062 and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under grant No. CHD300102312406 .","Wang B., Ming Y., Zhu Y., Yao X., Ziegmann G., Xiao H., Zhang X., Zhang J., Duan Y., Sun J., Fabrication of continuous carbon fiber mesh for lightning protection of large-scale wind-turbine blade by electron beam cured printing, Addit.

In this study, polylactic acid (PLA) was preferred for the antenna substrate because it is environmentally friendly, easy to recycle, provides convenience in production design with a three-dimensional (3D) printer, and is less expensive compared to other available materials. Copper (Cu) tape and graphene filament were employed for the antenna patch component due to their benefits. The comprehensive comparative analysis between a full-wave model and a 3D-printed prototype of the antenna via the CST Microwave Studio program was demonstrated here. The surface characterization was achieved with scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD) analysis. The homogeneous Cu and oxidized graphene (GO) were detected. The weight percent of carbon (C) and oxygen (O) on the graphene surface was 59.82% and 40.18%, respectively. The Cu (111), Cu (200), and Cu (220) peaks were determined on the Cu tape. The GO (011) peak was seen in the XRD spectra of the graphene sheet.

A gateway usually supports a number of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) irrespective of their underlying communication technologies. Furthermore, a gateway usually supports a number of WSNs with blockchain master nodes, which employ diverse communication technologies. As a result, gateways are meant to play a versatile role without worrying about the underlying architecture, hardware, and software details of the connecting nodes in blockchain federated networks. This paper proposes a two-phased methodology for blockchain and IoT federated networks where efficient link selection based on a multi-criteria-based approach is performed. The dynamic gateway scheduling strategy is capable enough to support blockchain-based transactions as well as communication in IoT devices. Furthermore, the proposed methodology enhances data transfer fairness for each gateway, resulting in efficient data transmission. Machine learning (ML) methods are also devised to analyze the status of the communication channels before employing the link selection mechanism. Then the selection of links is performed based on multi-criteria statistical techniques. Finally, the scheduling is performed for selecting the appropriate gateway for channelizing the blockchain data speedily. The selection of links is made based on the dynamic status of the links. The usage of time series ML methods such as LSTM is made to predict the upcoming traffic on the links. Multiple criteria-based statistical approaches are utilized for the selection of the link optimally. Finally, the scheduling is performed to fulfil the criteria of 6G networks, where network users are rewarded with seamless connectivity and uninterrupted services. The efficacy of the proposed two-phased mechanism is demonstrated through simulation results. The results are demonstrated with respect to the total data conveyed, packet delivery ratio (PDR), energy consumed by the links, and throughput of the network. The PDR obtained by the proposed work for the high volume of data is 93% and for the low volume of data is 97%. The packet delay is reduced by 21% for low volume data and 19% for high volume data by the proposed methods. The data transmission is also optimized remarkably by the proposed method. The proposed fairness-driven mechanism (FDM) is compared with the state-of-the-art methods to prove the viability and robustness of the two-phased proposed mechanism of link selection for data transmission over blockchain and IoT federated networks. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","blockchain; Internet of Things (IoT); IoT gateways (IGWs); sixth generation (6G) networks; solution specific gateways (SSGWs)","Blockchain; Data handling; Data transfer; Gateways (computer networks); Long short-term memory; Scheduling; Sensor nodes; Block-chain; Communicationtechnology; Data-transmission; Internet of thing; Internet of thing gateway; Machine learning methods; Multi-criteria; Multi-Criterion; Sixth generation (6g) network; Solution specific gateway; Internet of things","","","","","","","Andrews M., Zhang L., Scheduling algorithms for multicarrier wireless data systems, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 19, 2, pp. 447-455, (2011); Aron R., Aggarwal D.K., Resource scheduling of concurrency based applications in IoT based cloud environment, Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing, pp. 1-12, (2021); Atlam H., Walters R., Wills G., Fog Computing and the Internet of Things: A Review, Big Data and Cognitive Computing, 2, 2, (2018); Bojovi'c B., Meshkova E., Baldo N., Riihijarvi J., Petrova M., Machine learning-based dynamic frequency and bandwidth allocation in self-organized LTE dense small cell deployments, EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking, 2016, 1, (2016); de Caldas Filho F.L., Rocha R.L., Abbas C.J.B., Martins L.M.C.E., Canedo E.D., de Sousa R.T., QoS scheduling algorithm for a Fog IoT Gateway.

The microstructure of the as-built and annealed TiAl alloys exhibited near γ structure and fully (α2/γ) lamellar structures, respectively. The creep properties were evaluated on the as-built and annealed TiAl alloys under a 250–300 MPa creep stress at 800 °C. The results showed that the creep property was improved significantly by post-heat treatment. The creep rupture life of heat-treated TiAl alloy was 1.6, 2.2, and 2.4 times that of as-built TiAl alloy under the stress of 250, 275, and 300 MPa at 800 °C, respectively. The creep stress exponents of the as-built TiAl alloy and heat-treated alloy were calculated and they were 8.94 and 5.96, respectively. Characterizing the fracture surfaces and deformed microstructure after the creep tests, the as-built alloy exhibited ductile fracture characteristics with numerous dimples. Whereas the heat-treated TiAl alloy displayed brittle fracture characteristics. Finally, the creep fracture behavior was discussed in detail. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Creep properties; Microstructure; Selective electron beam melting; TiAl alloy","3D printers; Aluminum alloys; Creep; Ductile fracture; Electron beam melting; Electron beams; Fracture mechanics; Heat treatment; Lamellar structures; Niobium alloys; Titanium alloys; Creep behaviors; Creep properties; Creep stress; Effect of heat treatments; Fracture characteristics; Microstructures properties; Post heat-treatment; Post-heat treatment; Selective electron beam melting; TiAl alloy; Binary alloys","","","","","Key Research and Development Program in Zhenjiang, (GY2021015); Natural Science Foundation for Higher Education of Jiangsu Province, (20KJA430001); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52001143, 52075228); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (BK20191458); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 52001143 and No. 52075228 ).

The numerical homogenization method has been well studied for analyzing mechanical behaviors of microstructures; however, it is too time-consuming to be applied to online computing or applications requiring high-frequency calling, e.g., topology optimization. Data-driven homogenization methods are considered a more efficient choice but the microstructures are limited to cubic shapes, therefore are unsuitable for periodic microstructures with a more general shape, e.g., parallelepipeds. This paper introduces a fine-designed 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) for fast homogenization of parallelepiped microstructures, named PH-Net. Superior to existing data-driven methods, PH-Net predicts the local displacements of microstructures under specified macroscopic strains instead of direct homogeneous material, empowering us to present a label-free loss function based on minimal potential energy. For dataset construction, we introduce a shape–material transformation and voxel-material tensor to encode microstructure type, base material and boundary shape together as the input of PH-Net, such that it is CNN-friendly and enhances PH-Net on generalization in terms of microstructure type, base material, and boundary shape. PH-Net predicts homogenized properties hundreds of times faster than numerical homogenization and even supports online computing. Moreover, it does not require a labeled dataset and thus the training process is much faster than current deep learning methods. Because it can predict local displacement, PH-Net provides both homogeneous material properties and microscopic mechanical properties, e.g., strain and stress distribution, and yield strength. We also designed a set of physical experiments using 3D printed materials to verify the prediction accuracy of PH-Net. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Deformed microstructures; Homogenization theory; Parallelepiped microstructures","3D printers; Computation theory; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Geometry; Homogenization method; Learning systems; Multilayers; Numerical methods; Potential energy; Strain; Yield stress; Base material; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Deformed microstructure; Homogeneous materials; Homogenization theory; Local displacement; Numerical Homogenisation; Online computing; Parallelepiped microstructure; Microstructure","","","","","Science and Technology Program of Shenzhen, China, (CJGJZD20200617102202007); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","We thank all the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and constructive suggestions.

The microstructure features a typical bimodal grain structure, with abundant L12-Al3Zr particles about 100 nm distributed. The yield strength (YS) of 449 ± 4 MPa, ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 449 ± 5 MPa, and the elongation to failure (EL) of 15.1 ± 1.9% are obtained after peak aging. In addition to solid solution strengthening, grain boundary strengthening and nanoparticle strengthening, the long-range stacked ordered 9R phase associated with high content Mg and Zr also contributes to strengthening. Besides, the difference in strain distribution between coarse and fine grain zones causes deformation-induced hardening. Low-temperature dynamic precipitation is observed in this Al–Mg–Zr alloy for the first time. The deformation-induced hardening and dynamic precipitation improve the strain-hardening capability, consequently delaying necking instability. After peak aging treatment, the number of Al3Zr particles with strong high-temperature stability increases, inhibiting grain coarsening and enhancing the precipitation strengthening effect. The excellent strength-ductility trade-off of the printed Al–Mg–Zr without expensive Sc element gives it a broad application prospect in economical and large-scale additive manufacturing. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","9R phase; Additive manufacturing; Al–Mg–Zr alloy; Dynamic precipitation; Mechanical property","3D printers; Age hardening; Binary alloys; Coarsening; Deformation; Dynamics; Economic and social effects; Grain boundaries; Magnesium alloys; Precipitation (chemical); Strain hardening; Temperature; Tensile strength; Zircaloy; 9r phase; After-peaks; Alloy microstructure; Al–mg–zr alloy; Dynamic precipitation; Laser powders; Mg-zr alloys; Microstructure mechanical properties; Peak aging; Powder bed; Aluminum alloys","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (U21B2073); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, (ZR2020ZD04); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province; Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, (JCYJ20180508151903646); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality; State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing, SKLSP, (SKLSP202109); State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing, SKLSP; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFB3700904); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars, (2020JJ2046); National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars","The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support of the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2021YFB3700904 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China ( U21B2073 ), Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province ( ZR2020ZD04 ), Shenzhen Science and Technology Plan ( JCYJ20180508151903646 ), Hunan Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars ( 2020JJ2046 ), Fund of The State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing in NWPU ( SKLSP202109 ).","Olakanmi E.O., Cochrane R.F., Dalgarno K.W., A review on selective laser sintering/melting (SLS/SLM) of aluminium alloy powders: processing, microstructure, and properties, Prog.

The nonlinear characteristics of BC-PCFs with the circular lattice (CL), square lattice (SL), and hexagonal lattice (HL) are analyzed numerically to select the optimal PCF. The three optimized structures: #CBF1, #SBF2, and #HBF3 are intended for supercontinuum generation (SCG) in an all-normal dispersion regime. The obtained results demonstrated that although #HBF3 fiber has a larger effective mode area and attenuation than #CBF1, #SBF2 fibers, the dispersion curve of #HBF3 is flattest and closest to the zero-dispersion curve in the wavelength region of 0.8–2.0 µm hence it has the highest efficiency for SCG. These PCFs are capable of coherent octave-wide SCG in the 0.66–1.53 µm, 0.71–1.76 µm, and 0.71–1.82 µm wavelength ranges with low peak power of 0.45 kW and 40 fs pulses coupled to the core. Those fibers are the real objects for the sources of all-fiber supercontinuum, which can be substituted for glass core fibers because the nonlinearity of silica is lower than that of benzene. The proposed remedy can lead to new low-cost all-fiber optical systems. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Benzene; Circular lattice; Coherent octave-wide SCG; Hexagonal lattice; Square lattice","Chromatic dispersion; Crystal lattices; Fibers; Silica; Supercontinuum generation; All fiber; Circular lattices; Coherent octave-wide supercontinuum generation; Dispersion characteristics; Dispersion curves; Hexagonal lattice; Photonic-crystal fiber; Spectral intensity; Square lattices; Super continuum; Benzene","","","","","Vietnam’s Ministry of Education and Training, (B2021- DHH- 08)","This research is funded by Vietnam’s Ministry of Education and Training (B2021- DHH- 08).

The present study compares inks based on either low-melt agarose or agar at different concentrations (3–6%) and loaded with the thermostable enzyme esterase 2 from the thermophilic organism Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius (AaEst2) with regard to their suitability for the fabrication of such enzymatically active hydrogels. A customized printer setup including a heatable nozzle and a cooled substrate was established to allow for clean and reproducible prints. The inks and printed hydrogel samples were characterized using rheological measurements and compression tests. All inks were found to be sufficiently printable to create lattices without overhangs, but printing quality was strongly enhanced at 4.5% polymer or more. The produced hydrogels were characterized regarding mechanical strength and diffusibility. For both properties, a strong correlation with polymer concentration was observed with highly concentrated hydrogels being more stable and less diffusible. Agar hydrogels were found to be more stable and show higher diffusion rates than comparable agarose hydrogels. Enzyme leaching was identified as a major drawback of agar hydrogels, while hardly any leaching from agarose hydrogels was detected. The poor ability of agar hydrogels to permanently immobilize enzymes indicates their limited suitability for their employment in perfused biocatalytic reactors. Batch-based activity assays showed that the enzymatic activity of agar hydrogels was roughly twice as high as the activity of agarose hydrogels which was mostly attributed to the increased amount of enzyme leaching. Agarose bioinks with at least 4.5% polymer were identified as the most suitable of the investigated inks for the printing of biocatalytic reactors with AaEst2. Drawbacks of these inks are limited mechanical and thermal stability, not allowing the operation of a reactor at the optimum temperature of AaEst2 which is above the melting point of the employed low-melt agarose.

Through-the-thickness peel strains are obtained throughout the overlap region during the entire tensile test. It is observed that real-time monitoring of the strain in the overlap region informs on the location of the failure before the load reaches 50% of its ultimate value. The peel strain-load curves for both the overlap ends superimpose perfectly up to about 40% − 50% of the applied tensile load and diverge considerably beyond this level. Similar behavior occurs for shear strain and is confirmed for quasi-isotropic (QI) and cross-ply (CP) laminate stacking sequences. It is also found that peel and shear strains, as well as joint rotation in CP, are higher than those of QI. These results can be useful for the design of this type of joint. © 2022","Composites; DIC; Hybrid joints; Peel strain","Bolts; Hybrid composites; Laminated composites; Shear strain; Strain measurement; Tensile testing; Composite joint; Digital image correlation technique; Digital image correlations; Hybrid joints; Overlap region; Peel strain; Quasi-isotropic; Single laps; Strain distributions; Thickness strain; Image correlation","","","","","Bombardier Aerospace; Consortium for Research and Innovation in Aerospace in Quebec; Delastek Aeronautique Inc.; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and the Consortium for Research and Innovation in Aerospace in Quebec (CRIAQ).

Numerical analysis of the effects of the imperfections and the uncertainty quantification (UQ) can be often done by use of digital stochastic surrogate material models. In this work, we present a new flexible class of surrogate models depending on a small number of parameters and a calibration strategy ensuring that the constructed model fits to the available observation data, with special focus on two-phase materials. The surrogate models are constructed as the level-set of a linear combination of an intensity field representing the topological shape and a Gaussian perturbation representing the imperfections, allowing for fast sampling strategies. The mathematical design parameters of the model are related to physical ones and thus easy to interpret. The calibration of the model parameters is performed using progressive batching sub-sampled quasi-Newton minimization, using a designed distance measure between the synthetic samples and the data. Then, employing a fast sampling algorithm, an arbitrary number of synthetic samples can be generated to use in Monte Carlo type methods for prediction of effective material properties. In particular, we illustrate the method in application to UQ of the elasto-plastic response of an imperfect octet-truss lattice which plays an important role in additive manufacturing. To this end, we study the effective material properties of the lattice unit cell under elasto-plastic deformations and investigate the sensitivity of the effective Young's modulus to the imperfections. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Elasto-plastic material; Random fields; Stochastic optimization; Surrogate model; Uncertainty quantification","Additives; Calibration; Casting; Elastic moduli; Elastoplasticity; Monte Carlo methods; Optimization; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Effective material property; Elasto-plastic response; Elastoplastic materials; Material modeling; Random fields; Random imperfections; Stochastic optimizations; Surrogate materials; Surrogate modeling; Uncertainty quantifications; 3D printers","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (WO671/11-1); Horizon 2020, (800898)","Funding text 1: UK and BW were supported by the German Research Foundation by grants WO671/11-1 and the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 800898 .

However, the underlying mechanisms of the positive function of laponite in hydrogel was not fully explored. In this study, the effect of 3D bioprinted nano-laponite hydrogel construct on bone regeneration and the potential mechanism was explored in vitro and in vivo. In vitro analyses showed that the 3D construct protected encapsulated cells from shear stresses during bioprinting, promoted cell growth and cell spreading, and BMSCs at a density of 107/mL exhibited an optimal osteogenesis potential. Osteogenic differentiation and ectopic bone formation of BMSCs encapsulated inside the 3D construct were explored by determination of calcium deposition and x-ray, micro-CT analysis, respectively. RNA sequencing revealed that activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway of BMSCs inside the laponite hydrogel significantly upregulated expression of osteogenic related proteins. Expression of osteogenic proteins was significantly downregulated when the PI3K/AKT pathway was inhibited. The 3D bioprinted nano-laponite hydrogel construct exhibited a superior ability for bone regeneration in rat bones with defects compared with groups without laponite as shown by micro-CT and histological examination, while the osteogenesis activity was weakened by applications of a PI3K inhibitor. In summary, the 3D bioprinted nano-laponite hydrogel construct promoted bone osteogenesis by promoting cell proliferation, differentiation through activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. © 2022","Bioprinting; Cell density; Nano-laponite; Osteogenesis; Signal pathway","Bone; Cell proliferation; Cell signaling; Chemical activation; Computerized tomography; Defects; Proteins; Shear stress; Bioprinting; Bone defect; Bone regeneration; Cell density; Laponites; Micro CT; Nano-laponite; Osteogenesis; Signal pathways; Signalling pathways; Hydrogels","","","","","Home for Researchers; Xi'an Particle Cloud Biotechnology Co.

However, the cold metal transfer additive manufactured (CMTAMed) parts generally produce coarse columnar grains along the building direction, resulting in the anisotropy of tensile properties. In this paper, the effects of double-sided ultrasonic impact treatment (UIT) on the surface roughness, residual stress distribution, microstructure and tensile properties of the CMTAMed Ti6Al4V alloy in both horizontal and vertical directions were investigated. Results indicated that UIT significantly reduced surface roughness and realized the tensile-compressive conversion of residual stress in the surface layer. Furthermore, massive stacking faults (SFs) structures and high-density dislocations were stimulated in the original α martensite, leading to the grain refinement. Moreover, both the CMTAMed samples displayed synchronous enhancement of strength and ductility after double-sided UIT, while the growth rates of the horizontal samples are higher than that of the vertical ones, making a decline in the anisotropy of tensile properties. Consequently, the gradient microstructure and anisotropy regulation mechanism of tensile properties dominated by double-sided UIT was clarified. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Anisotropic regulation; Cold metal transfer additive manufacturing; Microstructure; Tensile property; Ti6Al4V alloy; Ultrasonic impact treatment","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Anisotropy; Grain refinement; Metals; Microstructure; Residual stresses; Surface roughness; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Additive manufacturing technology; Anisotropic regulation; Cold metal transfer additive manufacturing; Cold metal transfers; Columnar grain; Double sided; Metallic component; Residual stresses distributions; Ti-6Al-4V alloy; Ultrasonic impact treatment; Tensile properties","","","","","Jiangsu Provincial Science and Technology Projects in China, (BE2021072, BE2022069-4); Natural Science Research Project of Higher Education Institutions of Jiangsu Province in China, (22KJB460001); Six Major Talent Peak of Jiangsu Province in China, (2019−GDZB−251); Youth Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province in China, (BK20220530); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52175323, 52175409)","The financial support was provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 52175409 , 52175323 ), Jiangsu Provincial Science and Technology Projects in China ( BE2022069-4 , BE2021072 ), Six Major Talent Peak of Jiangsu Province in China (No. 2019−GDZB−251 ), Youth Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province in China (No. BK20220530 ), and Natural Science Research Project of Higher Education Institutions of Jiangsu Province in China (No. 22KJB460001 ).","Lu J.Z., Lu H.F., Xu X., Yao J.H., Cai J., Luo K.Y., High-performance integrated additive manufacturing with laser shock peening induced microstructural evolution and improvement in mechanical properties of Ti6Al4V alloy components, Int.
