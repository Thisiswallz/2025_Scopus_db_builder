The continuous Carbon Fibre (CF) deposition is an interesting approach since it allows to depose continuous CF bundles following different geometries and avoiding the limitations of current composite manufacturing techniques. Choosing the CF deposition path means also giving the designer the possibility to reinforce areas of the designed component which are subjected to stress concentrations, thus increasing its fracture resistance. In this work, a study on the reinforcement capabilities of this technology is performed, considering different specimen geometries and different geometries for the CF deposition path. Two different geometries are analysed: a V-notch and an Open-Hole specimen, both subjected to tensile loading. To model the fracture scenario, a Phase Field framework is exploited. The V-notch simulation demonstrates the capability of Phase Field to catch both the fracture path and the mechanical response reported in experiments from the literature. In the second part of the paper, the Open Hole Tension test is simulated numerically by means of the same tools described above, taking into consideration different geometries for the reinforcement around the hole. The specimens with different reinforcement geometries show different mechanical responses and crack patterns, thus highlighting the influence of the continuous CF reinforcement geometry on the fracture scenario. © 2022 The Author(s)","3D printed materials; Additive layer manufacturing; Finite elements; Phase field","3D printers; Additives; Deposition; Finite element method; Fracture; Geometry; Reinforcement; Tensile testing; 3d printed material; Additive layer manufacturing; Continuous fiber composites; Different geometry; Fiber deposition; Finite element; Mechanical response; Phase fields; Printed materials; V-notches; Carbon fibers","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, MSCA, (861061); European Commission, EC; Horizon 2020","Funding text 1: The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Simone Sangaletti reports financial support was provided by European Commission.

These components are often not self-contained, and therefore to form a working assembly, they must be attached to other components. In this study, ABS and PLA, two commonly used 3D printing materials, were 3D printed utilizing a Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) machine. The 3D-printed parts were then rotary friction-welded to solid (non-printed) ABS parts. Rotating-beam fatigue experiments at various stress levels were used to evaluate the fatigue strength of these weld joints. Fatigue testing was also carried out on solid ABS/solid ABS and non-welded ABS samples. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of the fracture surfaces was performed employing field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). According to the results, non-welded ABS, solid ABS/solid ABS, solid ABS/3D-printed ABS, and solid ABS/3D-printed PLA had the best fatigue performance in this order. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS","3D printing; ABS; Additive manufacturing; Fatigue; Friction welding; Fused filament fabrication; PLA; Polymers; Rotary friction welding","Additives; Deposition; Fatigue testing; Field emission microscopes; Friction; Friction stir welding; Scanning electron microscopy; Welds; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; ABS; Friction-welded joints; Fused filament fabrication; Manufacturing IS; PLA; Printing materials; Rotary friction; Rotary friction welding; 3D printers","","","","","","","Afrose M.F., Masood S.H., Iovenitti P., Nikzad M., Sbarski I., Effects of part build orientations on fatigue behaviour of FDM-processed PLA material, Prog.

The important means to achieve this aim is to integrate biomaterials and life elements. Hydrogels are very attractive biomaterials in the field of TE. In particular, engineering extracellular matrices (ECMs) formed by photosensitive hydrogels have captivated much attention, because photopolymerization has many advantages over traditional polymerization approaches, such as rapidity of reaction, spatiotemporal controllability of polymerization process, and operability at physiological temperature, especially it can realize the fabrications of engineering ECMs in the presence of living cells. There have been many excellent reviews on the applications of photosensitive hydrogels in TE in recent years, however, it is inevitable that researchers may have left out many important facts due to exploring the literature from one or a few aspects. It is also a great challenge for researchers to explore the internal relationships among countries, institutions, authors, and references from a large number of literatures in related fields. Therefore, bibliometrics may be a powerful tool to solve the above problems. A bibliometric and visualized analysis of publications concerning the photosensitive hydrogels for TE applications was performed, and the knowledge domain, research hotspots and frontiers in this topic were identified according to the analysis results. Methods: We identified and retrieved the publications regarding the photosensitive hydrogels for TE applications between 1996 and 2022 from Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). Bibliometric and visualized analysis employing CiteSpace software and R-language package Bibliometrix were performed in this study. Results: 778 publications meeting the eligibility criteria were identified and retrieved from WoSCC. Among those, 2844 authors worldwide participated in the studies in this field, accompanied by an average annual article growth rate of 15.35%. The articles were co-authored by 800 institutions from 46 countries/regions, and the United States published the most, followed by China and South Korea. As the two countries that published the most papers, the United States and China could further strengthen cooperation in this field. Univ Colorado published the most articles (n = 150), accounting for 19.28% of the total. The articles were distributed in 112 journals, among which Biomaterials (n = 66) published the most articles, followed by Acta Biomaterialia (n = 54) and Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part A (n = 42). The top 10 journals published 47.8% of the 778 articles. The most prolific author was Anseth K (n = 33), followed by Khademhosseini A (n = 29) and Bryant S (n = 22). A total of 1443 keywords were extracted from the 778 articles and the keyword with the highest centrality was “extracellular matrix” (centrality: 0.12). The keywords appeared recently with strong citation bursts were “gelatin”, “3d printing” and “3d bioprinting”, representing the current research hotspots in this field. “Gelma”, “3d printing” and “thiol-ene” were the research frontiers in recent years. Conclusion: This bibliometric and visualized study offered a comprehensive understanding of publications regarding the photosensitive hydrogels for TE applications from 1996 to 2022, including the knowledge domain, research hotspots and frontiers in this filed. The outcome of this study would provide insights for scholars in the related research filed.

The alloys have been shown to be printable without solidification cracking along with high supersaturation of solutes in as-printed state. Upon direct ageing, two families of precipitates namely Al-Mn and Al-Zr are observed. Al-Mn containing precipitates, which are observed in as-printed condition as nanometric precipitates decorating special regions are seen to grow preferentially at grain boundaries, which is followed by growth in bulk of the sample. A possible explanation is suggested to be a higher diffusivity at grain boundaries leading to faster growth while depleting solutes around grain boundary region quickly. The Al-Zr precipitation, which normally follows bulk precipitation is observed to co-precipitate with Al-Mn precipitates. Optimised heat treatments are seen to achieve peak hardness of 143 HV at 623 K for 24 h and 142 HV at 648 K for 14 h as compared to 102 HV in as-printed condition for one of the alloys. This overall hardening effect is attributed majorly to Al3Zr nanoprecipitates along with semi-coherent Al12Mn precipitates. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Aluminium-manganese alloys; Powder bed fusion - laser beam; Precipitation kinetics","3D printing; Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Chromium alloys; Grain boundaries; Heat treatment; High strength alloys; Kinetics; Laser beams; Microstructure; Precipitation (chemical); Zircaloy; Aluminum-manganese alloy; Condition; Fusion lasers; Grain-boundaries; High-strength; Microstructure and properties; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion - laser beam; Precipitation kinetics; Zr-based alloy; Manganese alloys","","","","","Chalmers University; Tea Bertilsson at Höganäs; VINNOVA; Svenska Forskningsrådet Formas; Energimyndigheten, (2016–05175)","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the funding from Strategic Innovation Programme LIGHTer with support from VINNOVA , FORMAS and Energimyndigheten .

Fused deposition modeling (FDM) has witnessed even faster growth of application as its equipment is environmentally friendly and easily adaptable. This increased use of FDM to manufacture prototypes and finished parts is accompanied by concerns that 3D printed parts do not perform the same as relatively homogeneous parts produced by molding or machining. As the interface between two faces of bonded material may be modeled by stress elements, in theory, by modeling 3D printed layers subjected to tension at varying angles as transformed stress elements, the stress required to break the layer bonds can be determined. To evaluate such a relationship, in this study, the stresses calculated from stress transformation were compared with the behavior of 3D printed specimens subjected to tensile loads. The maximum principal stress was found to be constant relative to the layer angle, regardless of whether the specimen experienced failure at the layer interface or within the layer material, although the specimens with layers 75° relative to the load were notable exceptions to this finding. This failure at much lower stresses for the samples used in the 75° tests may be attributed to a possible environmental factor, such as temperature or humidity change, degrading the samples’ structural integrity. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Additive manufacturing;

Tensile properties were evaluated for different material conditions, i.e., as-built (AB), direct aging (DA), solution treatment (ST), and T6 heat treatment. It was observed that the as-built samples had the highest yield and tensile strength with limited ductility while increasing the peak heat treatment temperature improves the ductility but at the cost of strength. The microhardness also followed a declining trend with an increase in peak heat treatment temperature. An empirical correlation, validated by experimental data, was established to predict the properties based on peak heat treatment temperatures. Based on the observed test results, four material conditions were selected for evaluating the high cycle fatigue (HCF) properties, i.e., AB, SR, DA, and T6. The as-built samples displayed superior fatigue resistance while that of T6 heat treated samples were most deteriorated. The heat treatment-induced microstructural transformation influences the tensile, hardness, and fatigue properties of the SLM AlSi10Mg, mainly due to the disintegration of continuous Al–Si cellular network and the subsequent formation of discrete Si-particles at high temperatures. The interaction between microstructurally-controlled mechanical properties, associated heat treatment process and the intrinsic damage mechanisms was investigated in detail and discussed later in this study. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Aluminum; Fatigue; Heat treatment; Microstructure","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum; Disintegration; Ductility; Fatigue of materials; Hardness; Heat resistance; Morphology; Silicon alloys; Tensile strength; Al-Si alloy; Direct aging; Fatigue properties; Heat treatment temperature; Higher yield; Material conditions; Silicon morphology; Solution treatments; T6 heat treatment; Yield and tensile strength; Heat treatment","","","","","Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, IITR, (FIG-100832); Ministry of Education, India, MoE","The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Vidit Gaur report financial support was provided by Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) and IIT Roorkee Faculty Initiation Grant (FIG-100832) to complete this study.

For revealing the impact of microstructural heterogeneity on anisotropic properties of AM processed parts, this work prepared 316 L SS components using selective laser melting (SLM) techniques under different laser scanning angles. Their tensile performances are examined, and the relationship between the origin points of deformation failure and molten pool boundary is established. The results show that when the laser scanning angle is parallel with the tensile loading direction, the elongation of 316 L stainless steel fabricated by SLM is the highest, reaching 52.5%. Meanwhile, the maximum yield strength of 687.5 MPa was obtained when the laser scanning angle was 30–45°. The main reason is that the mechanical properties of the SLM parts change with the adjustment of scanning angle due to the effect of short edge grain size and poor orientation of the low grain. So, this study will provide new insights into the microscopic fracture mechanism in SLM parts. © 2022","Anisotropy; Mechanical properties; Molten pool boundaries; Selective laser melting","Austenitic stainless steel; Failure (mechanical); Laser applications; Melting; Scanning; Selective laser melting; Shear flow; 316 L stainless steel; Laser scanning; Molten pool; Molten pool boundary; Scanning angles; Selective laser melting; Shear slip; Slip behavior; Steel materials; Tensile failures; Anisotropy","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, (ZR2020ZD04); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province; National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars, (2020JJ2046); National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars","The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support of Hunan Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars ( 2020JJ2046 ) and Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province ( ZR2020ZD04 ).","Chauvet E., Kontis P., Jagle E.A., Gault B., Raabe D., Tassin C., Blandin J.J., Dendievel R., Vayre B., Abed S., Martin G., Hot cracking mechanism affecting a non-weldable Ni-based superalloy produced by selective electron Beam Melting, Acta Mater., 142, pp. 82-94, (2018); Hilaire A., Andrieu E., Wu X.H., High-temperature mechanical properties of alloy 718 produced by laser powder bed fusion with different processing parameters, Addit Manuf, 26, pp. 147-160, (2019); Wang Y.M., Voisin T., McKeown J.T., Ye J.C., Calta N.P., Li Z., Zeng Z., Zhang Y., Chen W., Roehling T.T., Ott R.T., Santala M.K., Depond P.J., Matthews M.J., Hamza A.V., Zhu T., Additively manufactured hierarchical stainless steels with high strength and ductility, Nat.

In this work, the anisotropy in mechanical properties of an AlSi10Mg alloy fabricated by AM was investigated in terms of grain morphology, microstructure and residual stress distribution, with a focus on changes occurring during post-AM heat treatment by isochronal annealing. It was found that microstructural inhomogeneity is the major factor that weakens the melt pool boundaries, and leads also to anisotropic mechanical properties. Volumes in the vicinity of melt pool boundaries are characterized by coarse Al–Si eutectic networks and high residual stresses, where the former are the main reason for the plastic anisotropy, and the latter increase the local strength. Post-AM heat treatment can alleviate the presence of anisotropy due to homogenization of the microstructure and a redistribution of residual stresses. The overall effect of heat treatment on mechanical strength is a balance between improvement through precipitation strengthening and weakening of grain boundary strengthening, solid solution strengthening and dislocation strengthening. Through an appropriate heat treatment process (annealing at 280 °C for 2 h), the anisotropy in mechanical properties can be effectively reduced and a good strength-elongation synergy can be obtained (strength of 350 MPa and elongation of ∼9%). This study provides new ideas for understanding and mitigating anisotropy of additively manufactured AlSi10Mg, and also has implications for the study of anisotropy of other materials. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Anisotropy; Heat-treatment; Mechanical properties; Microstructural inhomogeneity; Selective laser melting","3D printers; Additives; Grain boundaries; Heat treatment; Microstructure; Morphology; Residual stresses; Strengthening (metal); Critical issues; Effect of heat treatments; Grain morphologies; Manufacturing IS; Manufacturing techniques; Melt pool; Metal additives; Microstructural inhomogeneity; Residual stresses distributions; Selective laser melting; Anisotropy","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51971045, 51971117, 52071038, 52130107); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This study was financially supported by the National Science Foundation of China (Nos. 52071038 , 51971117 , 52130107 , and 51971045 ).

This paper investigated dry sliding wear resistance of Ti-6Al-4V alloy manufactured by SLM, EBM and conventional processes at elevated temperatures up to 600 °C in contact with WC-Co. Linear reciprocating sliding wear tests were carried out under different applied loads and temperatures, and different wear mechanisms were identified and related to the manufacturing technique. Deviations of wear track width measurements indicated shape irregularly, which has been presented and discussed by SEM images of the wear tracks. Energy-dispersive x-ray analysis of surface layer showed how increasing temperature affects the surface oxide layer and debris. The results showed that for all three types of samples, the oxygen richer oxide debris layer at higher temperatures provided a protective layer with higher wear resistance, although strength and hardness of Ti-6Al-4V are lower at a higher temperatures. So, the combination of these two effects results in no significant effect of temperature on wear rate. © 2022, The Author(s).","electron beam melting; high temperature wear; selective laser melting; Ti-6Al-4V","3D printers; Additives; Debris; Electron beam melting; Electron beams; Energy dispersive X ray analysis; Temperature; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Titanium oxides; Vanadium alloys; Wear of materials; Wear resistance; X ray diffraction analysis; Effects of temperature; Electron-beam melting; High temperature wear; Highest temperature; Manufacturing techniques; Powder bed; Selective laser melting; Sliding wear behaviour; Ti-6al-4v; Wear tracks; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand, AUT","","Li H., Ramezani M., Chen Z., Singamneni S., Effects of Process Parameters on Temperature and Stress Distributions During Selective Laser Melting of Ti–6Al–4V, Trans.

Acrylic photo-resins are widely used in light-based 3D printing techniques. The green conversion of acrylate double bonds affects the performance of 3D printed parts before and after post-processing. This work describes a practical framework for predicting conversion profiles of green parts produced by digital light processing (DLP) vat photopolymerization, although the principle should be applicable to all light-based vat photopolymerization techniques. The practical model utilizes accumulated dose profiles and photopolymerization kinetics to make predictions of conversion profiles. Photopolymerization kinetics was determined by real-time photo-infrared spectroscopy, and a phenomenological model was employed to describe the cure kinetics which included oxygen inhibition period and dose rate dependency. A sub-linear dependence of cure kinetics on dose rate showed that effective dose rather than actual dose determined the degree of cure. A mathematical model for accumulated effective dose was developed, and the effects of the ratio of layer thickness to resin depth of penetration on accumulated effective dose profiles were discussed. Predicted conversion profiles from the model were compared to experimental z-direction conversion profiles measured by IR microscope. Further, a Matlab program was developed for predicting and tuning z-direction conversion profiles in DLP vat photopolymerizations with user-input printing parameters. Using the program, the model predicted a relatively flat conversion profile by over-exposing the last layer. The prediction was experimentally verified which showed the effectiveness of this simple model. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Accumulated effective dose; Conversion profile; Cure kinetics; Vat photopolymerization","3D printers; Curing; Forecasting; Infrared spectroscopy; Kinetics; MATLAB; Resins; Accumulated effective dose; Conversion profile; Cure kinetics; Digital light processing; Dose profile; Dose rate; Effective dose; Photo polymerization; Photopolymerization kinetics; Vat photopolymerization; Photopolymerization","","","","","Army Research Laboratory, ARL, (W911NF-17–2-0227)","Research was sponsored by the Army Research Laboratory and was accomplished under Cooperative Agreement Number W911NF-17–2-0227 .

The optimization campaign of printing parameters targeted the maximum density of printed cubic samples. The highest Archimedes density of 7.615 g cm−3 was achieved by laser power of 210 W, scan speed of 763 mm s−1, and hatch spacing of 80 µm corresponding to a volume energy density (VED) of 68.78 J mm−3 given the constant layer thickness of 50 µm. The relative density of the optimized sample was also measured by Computer Tomography (CT) scanning yielding a relative density of 99.85%. According to measured chemical composition and subsequent thermodynamic calculation, the TiC phase can be up to 7.2 vol%, and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) confirmed the presence of TiC phase in bcc-iron. Furthermore, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of sample cross-sections revealed well-dispersed submicron and nano TiC precipitates of two morphologies and size ranges – primary cubic particles (100–400 nm in size) and secondary plate-like particles (up to 300 nm length and below 50 nm width). No micro-cracks and contaminations were detected between the matrix and reinforcement. Electron Back Scattered Diffraction (EBSD) analysis of a cross-section parallel to build direction revealed extremely fine equiaxed grains with a mean size of 1.3 µm which suggests Columnar to Equiaxed Transition (CET). CET and grain refinement were most likely induced by the presence of TiC particles and rapid solidification within L-PBF. Finally, the micro-hardness tests were conducted to evaluate the reinforcement potential of TiC particles. The mean value of 357.0 ± 9.3 HV1 was obtained for the optimized sample which is superior to pure Fe fabricated via L-PBF and a similar MMC fabricated by Electron Beam Powder Bed Fusion (EB-PBF). Furthermore, the microstructure and hardness of the optimized sample was compared to the sample from optimization campaign with the highest coincident VED and relative density. Some micro-defects were observed in the optimized build and their morphologies and origins were discussed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Fe-based; In-situ metal matrix composite; Inert gas atomization; Laser powder bed fusion; Metal additive manufacturing; TiC","Chemical analysis; Computerized tomography; Grain refinement; Inert gases; Iron compounds; Metallic matrix composites; Metals; Microhardness; Particle size analysis; Powder metals; Reinforcement; Scanning electron microscopy; Textures; X ray powder diffraction; Fe-based; In-situ metal matrix composites; Inert gas atomization; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Matrix composite; Metal additive manufacturing; Metal additives; Metal matrix; Powder bed; Titanium carbide","","","","","; University of Toronto, U of T; University of Waterloo, UW; European Social Fund, ESF, (100327776)","Authors are thankful to European Social Fund (ESF) (Germany, Grand Number 100327776 ), to the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and the University of Toronto Dean\u2019s Catalyst Professorship for financial support of this study; furthermore, to Multi-Scale Additive Manufacturing Laboratory at the University of Waterloo and in particular to Francis Dibia for a provision of research facilities on a commercial basis.

A Gleeble thermal-mechanical simulator was used to create a microstructure gradient in the sample with different heat treatment temperatures to efficiently determine the optimal post-treatment temperature, which is followed by furnace heat treatments to find proper aging (Age) conditions. Solid solution at 830 ℃ for 2 h followed by water cooling + aging at 500 ℃ for 4 h followed by furnace cooling was considered to be the optimal post-heat treatment candidate because it gained a 12.85% improvement of yield strength (YS) and 3.33% improvement of the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), though tensile fracture elongation (EL) decreased 3.37% compared to the as-deposited samples. With this condition, microstructure evolution including β grains, α widmanstätten, grain boundary α (GB α), and α’ martensite was characterized at the same position of the sample experienced deposition (AD), solid-solution treatment (AD-ST), and aging (AD-ST-Age) respectively. The relationship between such step-by-step microstructure evolution with tensile strength as well as hardness change was analyzed and established. In the end, brittle fracture surfaces of AD, AD-ST, and AD-ST-Age samples were observed to find the factors that contribute to failure. © 2022","Mechanical properties; Microstructure evolution; Post-heat treatment; Ti-6Al-4V alloy; Wire and arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Grain boundaries; Heat treatment; Microstructure; Solid solutions; Tensile strength; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Condition; Gleeble; Gradient approach; Heat treatment temperature; Microstructure evolutions; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Post heat-treatment; Post-heat treatment; Ti-6al-4v alloy; Wire and arc additive manufacturing; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Experimental Center of Advanced Materials; National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Materials; Beijing Institute of Technology, BIT","The work is sponsored by the Beijing Institute of Technology Young Scholar Startup Program .

The superior comprehensive mechanical properties have been achieved in the as-SLMed CoCrNi alloy after rolling and annealing. The as-SLMed alloys delivered the yield strength of 693.4 MPa, the ultimate tensile strength of 912.7 MPa and the fracture strain of 54.4%. After rolling with 70% reduction in thickness and annealing at 700 °C for 2 h. the yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and fracture strain reached 1161.6 MPa, 1390.8 MPa and 31.5%, respectively. The exceptional strength-ductility synergy is mainly attributed to the refined hierarchical microstructures with coarsening grains at a level of 30 µm and ultrafine grains at a level of 1 µm, and the heritage of dislocation-formed sub-grains and other lattice defects. This investigation demonstrates that the SLM with subsequent rolling and annealing is beneficial to fabricate high strength and ductile MEAs with single face-centered cubic (fcc) structure. © 2022","Defects; Medium-entropy alloys; Microstructure; Selective laser melting; Strength-ductility synergy","Annealing; Chromium alloys; Coarsening; Cobalt alloys; Cold rolling; Ductility; Entropy; Grain refinement; High-entropy alloys; Melting; Ostwald ripening; Selective laser melting; Tensile strength; Ternary alloys; Yield stress; % reductions; Fracture strain; Grains refinement; Heterogeneous microstructure; Medium entropy; Medium-entropy alloy; Selective laser melting; Strength-ductility synergies; Tensile fractures; Ultimate tensile strength; Defects","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52071343); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2020YFB0311300ZL); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2020YFB0311300ZL) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52071343).","Yeh J.W., Chen S.K., Lin S.J., Gan J.Y., Chin T.S., Shun T.T., Tsau C.H., Chang S.Y., Adv.

The incorporation of nickel (Ni) interlayers between SS and Al is thought to improve structural integrity. This article provides a detailed characterization of SS–Ni and Al–Ni interfaces. The Al-Ni interface is divided into three intermetallic zones: AlNi at center, Al3Ni on Al side, and AlNi3 on Ni side. The Ni3Fe, NiFe, and NiFe3 intermetallics at the SS–Ni interface increase with heat input. The intermetallics at the Al–Ni interface are found to be affected by heat input as well as primary dendrite arm spacing (PDAS) and dendrite growth angle (DGA) of the Ni dendrites. With low heat input, low DGA, and high PDAS, the intermetallic thickness at the Al–Ni interface decreases. It is also discovered that as heat input increases, the hardness of both interfaces increases.

The nearly discontinuous antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transformation in bulk FeRh is well-known; however, the transition broadens considerably in fine particles and films with thickness less than 50 nm, precluding their potential applications. Here, we report an abrupt, bulk-like first-order magnetoelastic transformation in powders consisting of sub-micron particles of nearly equiatomic FeRh compound synthesized via solid-state mechanochemical co-reduction of FeF2 and RhCl3 and subsequent heat treatments. We demonstrate that annealing at temperatures ranging from 600 ̊C to 800 ̊C enables tailoring phase content, particle size, and magnetic properties of the powders. A maximum magnetic-field-induced entropy change of ~10 J/kg K at μ0ΔH = 1 T has been achieved in powders annealed at 800 ̊C. The retention of extraordinary responsiveness in sub-micron particles of FeRh is likely to open doors for system component fabrication using additive manufacturing methods, along with new opportunities to employ FeRh in theranostics. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Giant magnetocaloric effect; Iron-rhodium; Mechanochemical synthesis; Particles","Binary alloys; Chlorine compounds; Fluorine compounds; Iron alloys; Iron compounds; Magnetocaloric effects; Particle size; Powders; Rhodium alloys; Rhodium compounds; Bulk-like; First order; Giant magnetocaloric effect; Iron-rhodium; Magnetoelastics; Mechanochemical synthesis; Near room temperature; Niche applications; Particle; Submicron particle; Inverse problems","","","","","NSF-MRI, (1726617); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Basic Energy Sciences, BES; Iowa State University, ISU, (DE-AC02-07CH11358); Iowa State University, ISU; Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering, DMSE","Research at Ames Laboratory is supported by the Materials Sciences and Engineering Division , Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the US Department of Energy (DOE).

Microtissues composed of tissue-specific mesenchymal stem cells and extra cellular matrix (ECM) particles provide an alternative scheme for realizing biomimetic cell density and microenvironment. Nevertheless, due to their instability during manufacturing, scarce efforts have been made to date to assemble them using rapid prototyping methods. Here, a novel microtissue bioink with good printability and cellular viability maintenance for digital light processing (DLP) bioprinting is introduced. Generally, the microtissue bioink is prepared by crosslinking acellular matrix microparticles and GelMA hydrogel with a specific proportion. The microtissue bioink exhibits the desired mechanical properties, swelling ratio, and has almost no influences on printability. For instance, a DLP bioprinted ear with a precise auricle structure using microtia chondrocytes microtissue boink is created. Additionally, the chondrocytes in the printed ears show obvious advantages in cell proliferation in vitro and auricular cartilage regeneration in vivo. The microtissue composite bioink for DLP printing not only enables accurate assembly of organ building blocks but also provides a 3D shelter to ensure printed cells' viability. © 2022 The Authors.

The formation of defects and thermal residual stress during the SLM process could particularly affect product quality and life-time. Thus, to optimize the SLM process condition for Inconel 718 boasting the minimum of deteriorating properties, the microstructural study was conducted with various energy densities and preheating temperatures. The SLM process condition over 99.9% of density was established and the change of microstructural and mechanical characteristics were confirmed according to the preheating temperature from 50 to 150 °C. The fraction of the low angle grain boundary (LAGB) and the stored strain energy per unit volume gradually decreased as the preheating temperature increased. In particular, while maintaining the mechanical properties, the thermal residual stress in the direction perpendicular to the building direction decreased under the half value of yield strength which could induce deformation.

However, this alloy is often very difficult to process using laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB) because of the development of hot cracks during fabrication. Here, we show that adding 2.3 wt% of Zr to the 6061 heritage alloy makes it processable by PBF-LB (suppression of hot cracks). Hot crack mitigation is attributed to grain refinement. However, the addition of 2.3 wt% of Zr greatly affects the microstructure and thus the mechanical and electrical/thermal properties of the Zr-modified 6061 alloy. Consequently, there is a need to design heat treatments to achieve a trade-off between yield strength and thermal conductivity. In this work, we designed two heat treatment sequences aiming at achieving such a trade-off: an adapted T6 sequence (550 °C/30 min + 180 °C/4 h) and direct ageing at 400 °C/4 h. On the basis of a multiscale microstructural study using optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electron microscopy, we clarify the evolution of the microstructure induced by the designed heat treatments. The mechanical properties (hardness, tensile behavior) and thermal conductivity derived from electrical conductivity measurements are then discussed in light of the microstructural evolutions. The as-fabricated Zr-modified 6061 alloy shows a higher yield strength (370 MPa) than the heritage 6061 alloy in its T6 condition (260 MPa) but its thermal conductivity is found to be much lower (98 vs. 173 W/m.K). The two heat treatment sequences designed in this work enable the mechanical properties of the heritage 6061 alloy to be outperformed (yield strength of 350 and 460 MPa for the T6 and direct ageing heat treatment respectively) while maintaining an acceptable level of thermal conductivity (150 and 170 W/m.K for the T6 and direct ageing heat treatment respectively). © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Al-alloy; Laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB); Mechanical Properties; Microstructure; Thermal Conductivity","Aluminum alloys; Cracks; Economic and social effects; Grain refinement; Heat treatment; Thermal conductivity; Yield stress; 6061 alloys; Aging heat treatment; Al-alloy; Condition; Direct aging; Hot cracks; Laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB); Laser powders; Powder bed; Trade off; Microstructure","","","","","THALES Company; Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie, ANRT, (AN-10-LABX-44-01); Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie, ANRT","This work was supported by the THALES Company via the ANRT 2018/1549 funding.

It is known that the surface profile of as-built AM parts is significantly rougher than its traditionally manufactured equivalent, promoting stress raising features that have an adverse effect on fatigue life. This paper will focus on developing a deeper understanding of the fatigue properties of the widely-used alpha-beta titanium alloy, Ti–6Al–4V, as manufactured through electron beam melting (EBM) and the role that surface roughness plays. Results have been generated on as-built and machined & polished EBM test coupons, supported by microstructural and fractographic analysis, X-ray computed tomography (XCT), advanced surface profilometry and hardness testing. Results have shown that as-built EBM Ti–6Al–4V samples have a significantly inferior fatigue life than machined & polished samples, despite the material in each of the surface finish types being hot isostatically pressed (HIP). It has been revealed that while surface parameters, MR2 and Ra, provide no correlation to high cycle fatigue life, it is shown that as the Rp surface parameter decreases, the respective number of cycles to failure increases. It can be concluded that a samples’ surface roughness is a highly contributing factor in influencing fatigue performance, yet it should not be considered in isolation since other features, including porosity, also play an important role. © 2022 The Authors","Electron beam melting; Fatigue; Surface roughness; Ti–6Al–4V","3D printers; Aerospace industry; Computerized tomography; Electron beam melting; Electron beams; Finishing; High-cycle fatigue; Titanium alloys; Advanced manufacturing; Electron-beam; Electron-beam melting; Fatigue performance; Fatigue properties; Manufacturing IS; Manufacturing techniques; Surface finishes; Surface parameter; Ti–6al–4v; Surface roughness","","","","","Materials and Manufacturing Academy, (c80816); Swansea University AIM Facility; Llywodraeth Cymru; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; European Social Fund, ESF","The current research was funded by the Materials and Manufacturing Academy, M2A , (grant number: c80816 ) supported by the European Social fund through the Welsh Government .

This study used LPBF to dissolve TiC in a Ti-6Al-4V matrix and investigated how post-processing heat treatment and carbon content lead to improved strength and ductility. Pre-alloyed Ti-6Al-4V powder was mechanically mixed with up to 1 wt% TiC before undergoing LPBF. A comprehensive set of heat treatments was examined using 0.75 wt% TiC as a model composition. 1 h at 500 °C was deemed suitable for high strength applications, and 3 h at 700 °C was deemed suitable for a good mix of strength and ductility. TiC concentration was then varied from 0 to 1 wt% across both heat treatments. In the high-strength heat treatment, strength was improved to up to 1490 MPa with a ductility of 3.0% using 1 wt% TiC. Remarkably, with a heat treatment of 3 h at 700 °C, both strength and ductility increased to 1170 MPa with 11.5% ductility using 0.5 wt% TiC. These improvements are shown to be caused by solid solution strengthening and the pinning of prismatic dislocation slip. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon; Mechanical properties; Powder bed fusion; Selective laser melting; Ti64; Titanium","Aluminum alloys; Ductility; Heat treatment; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Titanium carbide; Carbon content; Effect of heat treatments; High-strength; Laser powders; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion; Selective laser melting; Strength and ductilities; Titania; Carbon","","","","","Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program; Swine Innovation Porc, SIP; Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST; Osaka University, OU; Council for Science, Technology and Innovation, CSTI; Light Metal Educational Foundation","This study was financially supported by Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (CSTI), Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP), ‘‘Materials Integration for revolutionary design system of structural materials” (Funding agency: JST , Japan), International Joint Research Promotion Program promoted by Osaka University, Japan, and the Light Metal Educational Foundation, Japan.

Typical printable formulations for DLP consist of (a mixture of) monomer(s), a photoinitiator and very often, an organic dye absorbing at the printing wavelength in order to improve the resolution. Herein, we exploit the use of push-pull azobenzene (azo) dyes to not only enhance printing resolution but also to enable light response (fourth-dimension) of printed shape memory polymers (SMPs) employing DLP without the necessity of adding inorganic additives. In particular, a library of azo-dyes with different substituents in ortho-position have been synthesized and added as active dyes in the printing formulation. The light activated shape memory effect is demonstrated for all the printed structures including the dyes. Among all of them, the structures containing chlorine-substituted azo dyes show the best performance. Importantly, the desired effect is achieved with only 0.1 wt% of dye in the formulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of using visible light as stimulus for spatially resolved activation of complex structures on demand. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry","","Additives; Azo dyes; Light; Organic polymers; Shape-memory polymer; 3-D printing; 3D object; 3D-printing; Azobenzene dyes; Digital light processing; High resolution; Light-activated shape memory polymers; Organic dye; Photoinitiators; Printing technologies; 3D printers","","","","","Verband der Chemischen Industrie, VCI; Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung, CZS; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, KIT; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (BL-1604/2-1, EXC-2082/1-390761711); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG","E.

Here, laser glazing was used as a cost-effective method to evaluate the potential of a powder-processed Al-Cr-Mn-Co-Zr alloy for MAM. The alloy powder exhibited a nano-composite microstructure consisting of an FCC Al matrix plus icosahedral quasicrystal (I-phase) dispersoids, and this microstructure was retained in the as-consolidated alloy. Single laser tracks were produced on the surface of a polished coupon of the consolidated alloy at a range of laser powers and scan speeds in a commercial powder bed fusion (PBF) system. The resultant microstructures and mechanical properties of the laser tracks were investigated by electron microscopy studies and hardness measurements. The laser tracks showed no solidification cracking, and the only morphological defects were occasional pores. All of the phases in the substrate alloy were melted fully in the laser tracks, and four different types of microstructures (solid solution, equiaxed dispersoids, mixed and radial growths) were observed in the solidified tracks. The microstructures obtained depended upon the input energy densities due to the combinations of laser processing parameters. The laser tracks with the solid solution and equiaxed dispersoid microstructures gave the highest hardness values of 154–170 HV, which is comparable to that of the substrate alloy. These data indicate that there is considerable promise for the application of such I-phase alloys in MAM. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Aluminum alloy; Laser glazing; Metal additive manufacturing; Microstructure; Quasicrystals","3D printers; Additives; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Cost effectiveness; Glazes; Hardness; Manganese alloys; Metastable phases; Nanocomposites; Solid solutions; Textures; Zircaloy; Alloy system; Candidate materials; I-phase; Icosahedral quasicrystalline; Laser glazing; Laser tracks; Manufacturing IS; Metal additive manufacturing; Metal additives; Substrate alloys; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Collins Aerospace; Collins-UConn Advanced Materials Center of Excellence; UConn Pratt&Whitney Additive Manufacturing Center","Funding text 1: This work was supported by a research grant from Collins Aerospace as part of the Collins-UConn Advanced Materials Center of Excellence.

This paper presents the findings from a study to optimize Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process parameters to improve the surface roughness of the printed test specimen. Taguchi 3⁴ and L9 orthogonal array were used to design the experiment. Samples models of the same size were fabricated with an open source FDM printer using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) material and were examined to see the structural differences. Taguchi method S/N ratio and means analysis was used to find the optimum process parameter for surface roughness. The results indicate that flow rate is the most influential process parameter towards better surface roughness, followed by layer height, printing temperature and print speed. The surface roughness of printed test specimen was found to be rougher with the increase in levels of flow rate. The flow rate is responsible for the unevenly aligned section of the deposited filament. It was discovered that the optimal proses parameter levels for surface roughness by the CR-10S Pro FDM machine are 0.1 mm of layer height, 90% of flow rate, 230°C of printing temperature, and 35mm/s of print speed. Thus, Taguchi method has proven to be a useful approach for optimizing parameters to improve the surface roughness of printed parts. © 2022, Penerbit UTM Press.

The results show that 800 °C annealing raises the ductility to 18%, while 950 °C annealing raises the ductility high up to 26%. Although the residual stress relief and martensite decomposition fully accomplished in both annealed samples, there is still a noticeable difference in ductility. The difference is due to that 950 °C annealing induce noticeable globularization which further alters the fracture mode. Further study indicates that with globularization of αGB phase (α phase along prior β grain boundary), the transgranular fracture replaces the detrimental intergranular fracture. Particularly, the high angle grain boundary (HAGB) between equiaxed αGB phase effectively inhibits the initiation and propagation of crack, when comparing to the low angle grain boundary (LAGB) in α lamella. The reason for globularization in 950 °C annealing could be concluded as the boundary splitting model. The β phase grow along the LAGB in α lamella and form thermal grooving. With the groove deepening, the lamella was separated into equiaxed α phase. In this process, high temperature annealing promotes sufficient bulk diffusion, which is a necessary condition for globularization of lamellar α phase in SLM Ti64 alloy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Fracture mechanics; Globularization; Mechanism of ductility enhancement; Selective laser melting; Titanium alloy","Additives; Annealing; Fracture mechanics; Grain boundaries; Selective laser melting; Stress relief; Textures; Titanium alloys; 950° C; Ductility enhancement; Fractures mechanics; Globularization; Low angle grain boundaries; Mechanism of ductility enhancement; Post process; Selective laser melting; Ti-6Al-4V alloy; Titanium (alloys); Ductility","","","","","","","Gu D., Shi X., Poprawe R., Bourell D.L., Setchi R., Zhu J., Material-structure-performance integrated laser-metal additive manufacturing, Science, 372, 6545, (2021); Zhang D., Qiu D., Gibson M.A., Zheng Y., Easton M.A., Additive manufacturing of ultrafine-grained high-strength titanium alloys, Nature, 576, 7785, pp. 91-95, (2019); Herzog D., Seyda V., Wycisk E., Emmelmann C., Additive manufacturing of metals, Acta Mater., 117, pp. 371-392, (2016); Williams J., Titanium, Titanium, (2007); Zhao Q., Sun Q., Xin S., Chen Y., Wu C., Wang H., Xu J., Wan M., Zeng W., Zhao Y., High-strength titanium alloys for aerospace engineering applications: a review on melting-forging process, Mater.

For instance, the fused deposition modeling (FDM) method allows users to print flexible filaments with pre-specified infill densities. In order to investigate the effect of the infill density on the performance of a 3D-printed compliant finger, this study performs experimental and numerical investigations in order to develop empirical equations for estimating the output force, the output displacement, and the input force corresponding to given values of the input displacement and infill density of the compliant finger. A commercially available thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) filament, Filastic™, manufactured by BotFeeder is used in this study. Prototypes of four compliant fingers with infill densities of 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% are produced. A two-fingered gripper is also developed and the relationship between the infill density and the maximum payload is investigated. In addition, a finite element model taking into consideration the hyperelasticity of the TPE is developed to analyze the behavior of compliant fingers with different infill densities. The numerical results show good agreement with the experimental data and with the curves for the empirical equations. © 2022 The Author(s)","3D printing; Compliant finger; Finite element analysis; Gripper; Infill density; Thermoplastic elastomer","3D printers; Elastomers; Grippers; Infill drilling; Reinforced plastics; Thermoplastics; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Compliant fingers; Empirical equations; Finite element analyse; Infill density; Performance; Printing techniques; Soft robotics; Thermoplastics (elastomers); Finite element method","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (110-2628-E-006-004, MOST 111-2628-E-006-001-MY2); National Cheng Kung University, NCKU; Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Alberta","Funding text 1: This work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (MOST 110-2628-E-006-004 and MOST 111-2628-E-006-001-MY2).

The effect of fibre orientation was investigated by considering three scratch directions, i.e. normal, transverse, and longitudinal to the fibres. Different scratch deformation modes were identified, namely mild abrasion, fibre breakage and fibre removal, depending on the normal load. The critical loads for the transitions between various deformation modes were greatly affected by fibre orientations. In particular, with the increase of load, samples with fibres in normal direction were more likely to experience fibre breakage and removal than the other two, associated with higher friction and wear rate. To further understand the failure behaviour of fibres, a finite element model was established to analyse the stresses generated in the contact region, especially on fibres. Special emphasis was focused on fibre/matrix interfacial bonding and fibre distribution, as the two main parameters concerned for the fused filament fabrication (FFF) technique. It was found that the interfacial bonding plays a key role in determining the failure process of fibre, as well as the size and shape of the formed fibre debris. The work contributes to an in-depth understanding of the scratch and tribological performance of carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRPs), thereby providing useful guidelines for the design and selection of CFRPs using additive manufacturing (AM) technology. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","C.

Box 1065, Spain","Additive manufacturing could be an excellent way of shaping magnetocaloric heat exchangers in magnetic refrigerators. However, the metal additive manufacturing techniques present the serious limitation that the melting of a magnetocaloric material can cause its transformation and the loss of functionality. Fused deposition modeling using polymer-based composite filaments is presented as a promising alternative as temperatures are low enough to preserve the magnetocaloric material. To prove this claim, a polymer-based composite filament containing 55 wt% of (La,Ce)(Fe,Mn,Si)13–H magnetocaloric fillers has been manufactured using custom-made polymer capsules as the feedstock for the extrusion. Both adiabatic temperature change and isothermal entropy change have been characterized for the fillers, as-prepared filaments and as-printed parts, indicating that the magnetocaloric material functionality is not altered along the whole process. Printing resolution is comparable to the raw PLA filament. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Fused deposition modeling; Magnetocaloric composite","","","","","","Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA8655-21-1-7044); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR; Consejería de Economía, Conocimiento, Empresas y Universidad, Junta de Andalucía, (P18-RT-746); Consejería de Economía, Conocimiento, Empresas y Universidad, Junta de Andalucía","Work supported by Grant PID2019-105720RB-I00 funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033, Consejería de Economía, Conocimiento , Empresas y Universidad de la Junta de Andalucía (grant P18-RT-746 ), and Air Force Office of Scientific Research ( FA8655-21-1-7044 ).","Franco V., Blazquez J.S., Ipus J.J., Law J.Y., Moreno-Ramirez L.M., Conde A., Magnetocaloric effect: from materials research to refrigeration devices, Prog.

Bonchev Str., Sofia, 1113, Bulgaria","Revolutionary communication technologies including 5G and their correlated microelectronic equipment have generated the new generation of electronic components with a higher power density, which not only would bring electromagnetic waves (EMWs) radiation pollution but also would produce a lot of waste heat problems. In order to satisfy the requirements of advanced electronic components for the multifunctionality, light weight, flexibility, and complex structure, in this work, the polyolefin elastomer (POE)/graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) nanocomposites with tailorable porous structures were successfully prepared through effectively combining the ultrasonic dispersion strategy with the fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing technology. The results show that the synergistic effect of the constructed GNP network structure and the FDM printed porous structure could effectively enhance the electromagnetic shielding (EMI SE) performance of the 3D printed parts and meet their increasing demands for thermal management. When the content of the incorporated GNPs is 10.93 vol %, the EMI shielding efficiency (SE) value of the printed part could be up to 35 dB, and the value of the thickness-normalized specific SE (SSE/t) under the best printing conditions (50% infill density) could reach up to 244.9 dB·cm2/g. In addition, the achieved maximum thermal conductivity is 4.3 W/(m·K), which is 1600% higher than that of the pure POE matrix. The excellent flexibility of the printed pad also ensures its good contact with the electronic device during operation. Finally, the COMSOL simulation results verify the application feasibility of the FDM printed part. This work provides a novel strategy for preparation of customizable and multifunctional porous flexible parts, which is expected to be applied in the field of microelectronics such as communication intelligent devices. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

It is found that the SLM fabricated alloy exhibited slightly lower strength but much higher dynamic fracture toughness along the building direction, compared to those along transverse directions and the hot-rolled counterpart. The microstructure and defects of the SLM GH3536 alloywere characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) and micro-computer tomography (μ-CT). Furthermore, the correlation between microstructure anisotropy and dynamic fracture behaviors are explored by the KAM, fractography and crack trajectories analyses. It is concluded that the anisotropy related to dynamic fracture mechanism of GH3536 alloy manufactured by SLM can be attributed to the ‘weakest link’ interface due to the laser melted pool geometry, the grain boundary or dendrite, which is strongly dependent on the relative orientation difference between the building direction and the crack plane. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic fracture toughness; Microstructure anisotropy; Nickel-based superalloy; Selective laser melting","Computerized tomography; Cracks; Fracture; Fracture mechanics; Fracture toughness; Grain boundaries; Melting; Microstructure; Nickel; Nickel alloys; Scanning electron microscopy; Selective laser melting; Superalloys; Transmission electron microscopy; Crack initiation and propagation; Dynamic cracks; Dynamic fracture behavior; Dynamic fracture toughness; Impact energy; Microstructure anisotropy; Nickel-based superalloys; ON dynamics; Propagation behavior; Selective laser melting; Anisotropy","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52075366); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","The authors are grateful for the supports provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52075366 ).","Aghaie-Khafri M., Golarzi N., Forming behavior and workability of Hastelloy X superalloy during hot deformation, Mater.

Process parameters largely affect the quality characteristics of AM parts, such as mechanical strength and surface finish. This article aims to optimize the parameters for enhancing flexural strength and surface finish of FDM parts. A total of 18 test specimens of polycarbonate (PC)-ABS (acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene) material are printed to analyze the effect of process parameters, viz. layer thickness, build orientation, and infill density on flexural strength and surface finish. Empirical models relating process parameters with responses have been developed by using response surface regression and further analyzed by analysis of variance. Main effect plots and interaction plots are drawn to study the individual and combined effect of process parameters on output variables. Response surface methodology was employed to predict the results of flexural strength 48.2910 MPa and surface roughness 3.5826 µm with an optimal setting of parameters of 0.14-mm layer thickness and 100% infill density along with horizontal build orientation. Experimental results confirm infill density and build orientation as highly significant parameters for impacting flexural strength and surface roughness, respectively. © 2021 SAGE Publications.","Additive manufacturing; FDM; mechanical strength; micromachining; optimization; surface roughness","","","","","","","","Jeyachandrani P., Patil B., Et al., Development of thermoplastic feedstock filament for 3D printing, pp. 66-69; Patel N., Et al., A design, development and mechanical characterization of FDM machine, pp. 107-112; Deng X., Zeng Z., Peng B., Et al., Mechanical properties optimization of Poly-Ether-Ether-Ketone via fused deposition modeling, Materials, 216, 11, pp. 1-11, (2018); Motaparti K., Experimental investigation of effects of build parameters on flexural properties in fused deposition modeling parts, Virtual Phys Prototyp, 12, 3, pp. 207-220, (2017); Vishwas M., Basavaraj C.K., Vinyas M., Experimental investigation using Taguchi method to optimize process parameters of fused deposition modeling for ABS and Nylon materials, Mater Today, 5, pp. 7106-7114, (2018); Mohamed O., Masood S.H., Bhowmik J.L., Optimization of fused deposition modeling process parameters for dimensional accuracy using I-optimality criterion, Measurement, 81, pp. 174-196, (2016); Peng A., Xiao X., Yue R., Process parameter optimization for fused deposition modeling using response surface methodology combined with fuzzy inference system, Int J Adv Manuf Tech, 73, pp. 7-100, (2014); Onwubolu G., Rayegani F., Characterization and optimization of mechanical properties of ABS parts manufactured by the fused deposition modeling process, Int J Manuf Eng, 2014, pp. 1-13, (2014); Sood A., Ohdar R.K., Mahapatra S.S., Experimental investigation and empirical modeling of FDM process for compressive strength improvement, J Adv Res, 3, pp. 81-90, (2012); Panda S., Padhee S., Sood A.K., Et al., Optimization of Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process parameters using bacterial foraging technique, Sci Res, 1, pp. 89-97, (2009)","S.

After years of reliance on mechanical joints, human engineering now focuses on improving aerodynamic efficiency through smooth, full form changes in material geometry, achieved using technologies such as morphing composites. Promising improved power generation and efficiency in wind turbines and safer more sustainable aircraft and cars, these materials can achieve both large geometric changes with low energy requirements by cycling between several stable physical states and more gradual changes in geometry by exploiting coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch and structural anisotropy, shape memory polymers and 4D printing. The merits and limitations of these various shape change systems are the subject of extensive and ongoing academic research and both commercial and defence industry trials to improve the viability of these technologies for widespread adoption. Shape change capabilities are often associated with problems in material cost, mass, mechanical properties, manufacturability, and energy requirements. Nonetheless, the considerable and rapid advances in this technology, already resulting in successful trials in advanced civilian and military aircraft and high-performance cars, indicate that future research and development of this materials platform could revolutionise many of our most critical power generation, defence and transport systems. © 2022 The Author(s)","A.

In this work, we propose to improve the cracking sensitivity of CM247LC alloy by adding nanoscale TiC particles. The TiC/CM247LC nanocomposite with low crack defects was successfully prepared by selective laser melting (SLM), and the cracking inhibition behavior and strengthening mechanisms were systematically studied. The results show that the optimal SLM processing of TiC/CM247LC nanocomposite is scanning spacing of 80 μm, scanning speed of 1000 mm/s and laser power of 200 W. Under this processing, the defects ratio of the nanocomposite is 1.95%, which is about 2% lower than that of CM247LC, and the ultimate tensile strength and yield strength were obviously improved. The TiC particles can refine the nanocomposite grain and reduce local strain concentration, and the uniformly distributed TiC particles at grain boundaries also can strengthen grain boundaries, which may be the main reasons for the low crack defects of the nanocomposite. Load-bearing strengthening of particles and Orowan strengthening are the main strengthening mechanisms of the TiC/CM247LC nanocomposite. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Composite; Cracking; Nano-TiC particle; Selective laser melting (SLM)","Cracks; Grain boundaries; Melting; Selective laser melting; Superalloys; Tensile strength; Titanium carbide; Crack defects; Cracking sensitivity; Grain-boundaries; Manufacturing fields; Nano-TiC particle; Selective laser melting; Strengthening effect; Strengthening mechanisms; TiC particles; Nanocomposites","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51801115); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial supports provided by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 51801115 .","Catchpole-Smith S., Aboulkhair N., Parry L., Tuck C., Ashcroft I.A., Clare A., Fractal scan strategies for selective laser melting of ‘unweldable’ nickel superalloys, Addit.

The strength of bimetallic interfaces formed by immiscible metals such as stainless steel and copper alloys depends on the mechanism of bonding, the presence and nature of defects, and residual stresses, placing the focus of interest on the structure–mechanical performance relationship in the vicinity of the bimetallic interface. In this article, we report an investigation of laser powder bed fusion fabrication of thin plate bimetallic bronze-stainless steel samples. Sample characterization was performed using several techniques including surface topography and fractography, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, mechanical testing with digital image correlation mapping of strains during in situ tension inside scanning electron microscope. Spatially resolved evaluation of the local residual stress was carried out using the Korsunsky Focused Ion Beam micro-ring-core drilling method (FIB-DIC). Pure bronze and stainless steel samples fabricated separately possessed good strengths (ultimate tensile strengths of 150 MPa and 850 MPa, respectively) and significant amounts of ductility (local strains to failure of 0.8% and 1.2%, respectively), in spite of the presence of a relatively coarse and porous structure. Although the values for the bimetallic sample were somewhat reduced, they also demonstrated good mechanical properties, with the ultimate tensile strength of 105 MPa and 0.7% ductility. The fracture of bimetal takes place within the bronze at a distance of about 150 μm from the interface. The present report discusses the insights obtained, and charts the pathways towards further improvement of bimetal joint strengths through simple modifications of the laser powder bed fusion printing procedures. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Bronze-stainless steel bimetal; In situ tension; Korsunsky FIB-DIC; Laser powder bed fusion; Microstructure; Residual stress","Bronze; Ductility; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Fracture mechanics; Ion beams; Mechanical testing; Residual stresses; Scanning electron microscopy; Tensile strength; Topography; Bimetallic interfaces; Bronze-stainless steel bimetal; In-situ tension; Korsunsky FIB-DIC; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; Residual stress analysis; Steel samples; Ultimate tensile strength; Stainless steel","","","","","FabLab of Skoltech; Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (21-19-00791)","This research was funded by the Russian Science Foundation , grant number 21-19-00791 , https://rscf.ru/en/project/21-19-00791/ , and the authors are grateful to the crew of FabLab of Skoltech for their delicate and accurate sample preparations.

Environmental cost of IoT sensors and benefit from food loss (FL) reduction were both accounted. Sensor manufacturing, led by precious metals consumption, shows strong multiple toxicological effects, underscoring the importance of proper E-waste management and adoption of environmentally friendly materials. Avoiding FL (which will reserve 20–41% of the FL of perishable foods) and subsequent avoidance in the FL treatment further promoted the net gains, while brought multiple benefits in aspects of abiotic depletion (Sb), terrestrial ecotoxicity, photochemical oxidation, acidification, and eutrophication. Partially negative results on abiotic depletion (fossil fuels), ozone layer depletion, human toxicity, freshwater, and marine aquatic ecotoxicity were noted though, advancements in targeted sensor materials and technology innovation could eliminate these shortcomings.

SL can be online monitored via spatial temperature profiling by semi-passive RFID loggers (Jedermann et al., 2009, 2014a), the smart logistic unit (SLU) (La Scalia et al., 2017), the webGIS-based system (Sciortino et al., 2016), or intelligent packaging (Heising et al., 2014), all of which provide technical solutions, such as the wireless sensors and communication system for remote quality supervision (Jedermann et al., 2014b). In this regard, various SL models are established to quantify the ripeness of food by the mathematical correlations between the monitored attributes of various food in the supply chain (such as thermo, humidity, motion, and gases, e.g., H2S, C2H4, CO2, etc.) and the SL (La Scalia et al., 2017), via which it may further empirically develop the correlation between the SL extension and the FL saving (Defraeye et al., 2019; Shoji et al., 2022). LCA has been used as a decision support tool in various technical fields and disciplines to acquire the environmental impact of the product lifecycle which include its goal, scope, function units (FU), life cycle inventory and life cycle impact assessment (Cosme et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2017). The key point meanwhile main challenge of LCA inventory analysis is the precise measuring of input index (matter and energy) and output streams (waste and discharge), especially in some cases where these values may be difficult to measure (Wernet et al., 2016). LCA set up the platform of the environmental assessment of smart sensors application and FL in the supply chain, and SL models are pivotal nodes and connecting bridge between them.We thank the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD), 2019 Jiangsu Special Project for introducing Foreign Talents (BX2019015), and Key Achievement Cultivation Plan Project of Nanjing Forestry University for financial support.

In this paper, a method of combining process, structure and performance was proposed to control the forming quality, and the brake disc for high-speed railways was chosen as a validation example. Meanwhile, multi-laser selective laser melting (ML-SLM) was adopted to prepare large-sized products. Research mainly includes process parameters optimization, mechanical properties distribution, and structural design. Process parameters of 24CrNiMo were optimized by exploring the influence of laser power and scanning speed on porosity, pore characteristics, and forming efficiency. Results show excessive heat input could reduce forming quality, causing an increase in either porosity or pore size. Mechanical properties research reveals that 24CrNiMo parts fabricated by ML-SLM have good consistency and overcome the strength-toughness tradeoff. The ultimate tensile strength reached 1255.25 MPa and impact energy was 101 J for single-laser regions. Furthermore, the new brake disc was redesigned with an innovative hollow self-supporting heat rib structure to enable a lightweight design and simplify post-processing. Finally, the qualified product was produced, and bench tests showed SLM-disc had higher performance. The work shows this method is effective and provides an engineering example for large-sized parts fabricated by ML-SLM. © 2022 The Authors","Alloy steel; Bench test; Brake disc; Large-sized part; Multi-laser selective laser melting","Brakes; Chromium alloys; Fabrication; Melting; Pore size; Quality control; Railroad transportation; Selective laser melting; Speed; Steel metallurgy; Tensile strength; Ternary alloys; Bench tests; Brake disks; Combining process; Forming quality; Large-sized; Large-sized part; Multi-laser selective laser melting; Performance; Selective laser melting; Steel parts; Alloy steel","","","","","Benyuan Fund of Beijing Institute of Technology; Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China, MIIT; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFB1100205); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFB1100205), “Qiming Plan” of MIIT (China) and Benyuan Fund of Beijing Institute of Technology.","Bang G.B., Kim W.R., Kim H.K., Park H.-K., Kim G.H., Hyun S.-K., Kwon O., Kim H.G., Effect of process parameters for selective laser melting with SUS316L on mechanical and microstructural properties with variation in chemical composition, Mater.

The unique architectures of plate lattice metamaterials are regarded as the origin of achieving such advanced performance, but they lead to the difficulty of powder removal after the powder-bed-based additive manufacturing process. In the present work, plate lattice metamaterials with half-open-cell topology are proposed and fabricated via the laser powder bed fusion technique. To investigate their mechanical performance and deformation behaviours, numerical simulations and experimental tests are performed on finite element models and as-built specimens, respectively. Simulation results show that the mechanical properties and elastic anisotropy of half-open-cell plate lattice metamaterials are easily tunable when changing the geometric parameters, e.g., plate thickness or hole diameter. The elastic moduli and Poisson's ratio are found to scale nonlinearly with the hole diameter for different plate thicknesses, and the elastic anisotropy approaches 1.0 for specific hole size. The specific energy absorption of half-open-cell plate lattice metamaterials is up to two times higher than that of truss lattice metamaterials. The porous architecture, lightweight body, superior and easily tunable mechanical performance of half-open-cell plate lattice metamaterials provide them application potential in the fields of load-bearing, energy absorption and biomedical engineering. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Experimental study; Mechanical performance; Numerical simulation; Plate lattice metamaterials","Additives; Biomechanics; Biomedical engineering; Cells; Cytology; Energy absorption; Metamaterials; Numerical models; Topology; Cell plates; Elastic anisotropy; Experimental study; Mechanical performance; Open-cell; Open-cell topology; Plate lattice metamaterial; Plate thickness; Powder bed; Tunables; 3D printers","","","","","Academic Frontier Youth Team, (2018QYTD04); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51922044); Huazhong University of Science and Technology, HUST; Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2020B090923001)","This work is sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51922044 ), the Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province (No. 2020B090923001), the Academic Frontier Youth Team (2018QYTD04) at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST).

The thin films were deposited by an ‘in-plane’ mode or an ‘interlayer’ mode. The main characterisation technique employed was the essential work of fracture (EWF) method. Undertaking EWF tests on such thin films is shown to be a feasible and efficient way to evaluate the extent and quality of fusion bonding between individual filaments of the 3D printed SCF/PA6 composites. For example, firstly, for the 3D printed SCF/PA6 thin films it was readily evident that the extent of fusion bonding, i.e. the adhesion via molecular inter-diffusion, often termed the autohesion, between the filaments is the weakest, and the most variable, in the 3D printed SCF/PA6 thin films deposited via the interlayer mode. This was indicated by the lowest measured values of both the specific essential work of fracture, we, and the coefficient of determination, R2, of 19.6 kJ/m2 and 0.05, respectively, for the interlayer printed SCF/PA6 thin films. Secondly, the quality of the 3D printed SCF/PA6 thin films deposited via the in-plane mode was significantly enhanced by the use of further compression moulding process, since the value of R2 increased from 0.77 to 0.92. The results clearly suggest the need to improve the extent and quality of fusion bonding between individual filaments printed using the FFF process when 3D printed components are made for practical applications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Essential work of fracture; Fused filament fabrication; Fusion bonding; Process–structure–property relationships; Short carbon-fibre reinforced polyamide 6","3D printers; Carbon fibers; Carbon films; Fabrication; Fracture; Reinforcement; Carbon fiber reinforced; Essential work of fracture; Essential work of fracture methods; Fused filament fabrication; Fusion bonding; Polyamide 6; Process-structure-property relationship; Short carbon fibers; Short carbon-fiber reinforced polyamide 6; Thin-films; Thin films","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (190102354, DP190102354)","Funding text 1: This work is supported by the Australian Research Council (Discovery Project # DP190102354 ).

However, there exists a problem in fabricating medium-to large-volume parts in which the scan-line length is too long. The fabricated component often suffers from degraded mechanical properties due to lack-of-fusion pores. In this work, we apply in situ welding to rectify this critical problem. Here we select the Inconel 718 (IN718), one of the most widely used nickel-based superalloys in aerospace as an exemplar alloy to demonstrate this technique. The results are compared with previous studies on Ti–6Al–4V, the workhorse titanium alloy. Results reveal that the overlap distance to eliminate defects for IN718 needs to be greater or equal to 0.70 mm, which is slightly larger than the minimum distance required for Ti–6Al–4V. Columnar-to-equiaxed transition is observed in the overlap regions of samples with 0.70 mm and 3.50 mm overlap distances. An increase in overlap distance leads to a reduction in equiaxed grains, promoting better consistency of the microstructure in EB-PBF IN718 between overlap and non-overlap regions. On the other hand, varying the overlap distance shows little influence on microhardness variation. The overlap regions of the two samples studied have similar microhardness, which are higher than those of the non-overlap regions. This renders the tensile deformation dominant in the non-overlap region and results in a similar tensile property for the studied samples. These findings provide a solid basis for applying in situ EB-PBF welding technology in the industry and suggest a new avenue to tailor the grain morphology during EB-PBF. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Hardness; Inconel alloy; Overlapped melting; Precipitates; Tensile property","Electron beams; Microhardness; Morphology; Nickel alloys; Textures; Titanium alloys; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Electron-beam; Inconel alloys; Inconel-718; Non-overlap; Overlap distance; Overlap region; Overlapped melting; Powder bed; 3D printers","","","","","Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR, (1426800088); Nanyang Technological University, NTU; Xi'an University of Technology, XUT","Funding text 1: The work in the research was financially supported by the A*STAR Additive Manufacturing Centre (AMC) Initiative: Work Package 1 (High Temperature Materials Development for 3D Additive Manufacturing , Grant No. 1426800088 ).

However, the simplicity of the strategy, renewability, cost and effective dispersion of inorganic nanofillers in a hybrid framework remains challenging. This study proposed a simple, cost-effective, and sustainable design strategy to fabricate soybean meal (SM)-based hybrid adhesives using sodium lignosulfonate-functionalized graphene (SLS@G). SLS@G was simultaneously produced and functionalized via a dry ball milling method from graphite without using toxic reagents and tedious fabrication procedures. SLS@G had stable water dispersion and good compatibility with the SM adhesive matrix. The synergistic hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction between SLS@G and the protein chains remarkedly improved the strength and water resistance of the SM-based adhesive. With minimal addition of the SLS@G (0.10 wt% of SM), the modified adhesive dry and wet shear strengths increased to 2.19 MPa and 1.15 MPa, which were 32.7% and 248.5% higher than the pristine adhesive, respectively. Moreover, the construction of the organic-inorganic nanohybrid structure also contributed to the thermal stability of the SM-based adhesives, leading to the increase in carbon residue rate from 26.6% to 28%. Overall, this facile and green strategy offers a new design pathway for developing advanced and multifunctional bio-adhesives for engineered wood-based composites. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Adhesion strength; Functionalized graphene; Organic-inorganic hybrid composites; Soybean meal-based adhesive","Adhesives; Building materials; Cost effectiveness; Graphene; Hydrogen bonds; Hydrophobicity; Nanostructured materials; organic-inorganic materials; Proteins; Sustainable development; Thermodynamic stability; Effective dispersion; Functionalized graphene; Inorganics; Nanofiller; Organic-inorganic hybrid composites; Organic/inorganic nanohybrid; Performance proteins; Sodium lignosulfonates; Soybean meal; Soybean meal-based adhesive; Dispersions","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (32101456); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (BK20200795)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No: 32101456 ) and the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (Grant No: BK20200795 ).","Ahadian S., Estili M., Surya V.J., Ramon-Azcon J., Liang X., Shiku H., Ramalingam M., Matsue T., Sakka Y., Bae H., Nakajima K., Kawazoe Y., Khademhosseini A., Facile and green production of aqueous graphene dispersions for biomedical applications, Nanoscale, 7, 15, pp. 6436-6443, (2015); Arao Y., Kuwahara R., Ohno K., Tanks J., Aida K., Kubouchi M., Takeda S.-I., Mass production of low-boiling point solvent- and water-soluble graphene by simple salt-assisted ball milling, Nanoscale Adv., 1, 12, pp. 4955-4964, (2019); Bae S., Kim H., Lee Y., Xu X., Park J.-S., Zheng Y., Balakrishnan J., Lei T., Ri Kim H., Song Y.I., Kim Y.-J., Kim K.S., Ozyilmaz B., Ahn J.-H., Hong B.H., Iijima S., Roll-to-roll production of 30-inch graphene films for transparent electrodes, Nat.

As-built AM parts, especially when using powder bed fusion (PBF) processes, exhibit surface imperfections and defects leading to a remarkably irregular morphology that can significantly affect the product aesthetical and mechanical performance. Because of that, the part post-processing is a crucial step. Shot blasting is a simple and fast-finishing process commonly used in the AM supply chain to remove residual sintered particles attached to the component surface and reduce the surface roughness. This study investigates the shot blasting processes performed on AlSi10Mg and Ti6Al4V parts produced using laser-PBF (L-PBF) and electron beam-PBF (EB-PBF), respectively, considering the great geometric variability that a single component designed for AM can have in surface texture and geometries. Test artifacts were therefore devised with internal channels enclosed in the reticular structures and inclined flat surfaces to evaluate what happens in the external surface, internal channels, and reticular structures at the level of roughness and accuracy when these are simultaneously affected by the flow of abrasives. The effect of glass and zirconia microspheres and their combination on the surface roughness are analyzed. The results show a reduction of surface roughness up to approximately 38% for L-PBF and 82% for EB-PBF parts without altering their geometrical characteristics and processing the part for less than 1 min. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Additive manufacturing;

Spherical MoSiBTiC powders with uniform size distribution and good dispersion of component elemental particles were prepared by FD-POEM, without a melting process. Due to their distinctive mesh-like structure, the laser absorptivity of the FD-POEM particles was as high as 87.3%, allowing the elemental powders to be sufficiently melted under laser irradiation. The L-PBF build was primarily composed of a unique supersaturated solid solution Mo (Mosss) dendrites enriched with Si, Ti and B elements, Mo + Mo5SiB2 nanostructures, and TiC nanoparticles. The Mosss phase exhibited much higher hardness than Mo phase of the as-cast alloy attributing to the grain refinement and the solid strengthening effect. These results of this study provided an approach of fabricating high-performance Mo-based materials in ultrahigh-temperature applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Freeze-dry pulsated orifice ejection method (FD-POEM); Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF); MoSiBTiC alloy; Solid solution strengthening","Molybdenum; Orifices; Powders; Silicon; Silicon compounds; Solid solutions; Titanium alloys; Titanium compounds; Alloy powder; Freeze dry; Freeze-dry pulsated orifice ejection method; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; MoSiBTiC alloy; Powder bed; Pulsated orifice ejection methods; Solid solution strengthening; Uniform size; Grain refinement","","","","","JST-Mirai Program, (JPMJMI17E7)","This research was supported by the JST-MIRAI Program , Grant Number JPMJMI17E7 in Japan.

This paper details the correlation between the complex thermal cycles during directed energy deposition (DED) and the microstructure formation of a typical metastable β-titanium alloy Ti–15Mo, and elucidates its strengthening and toughening mechanisms. Relative to the forging standard, the yield and tensile strengths of the DED Ti–15Mo alloy increased by 51.4% and 28.7%, respectively, while retaining its elongation. Combined with experimental observation and finite element (FE) simulation, it was proven that the complex thermal cycles generated in the layer-by-layer stacking process of DED resulted in the presence of sub-structure in the Ti–15Mo alloy, precipitating the metastable ω phase, thereby improving its strength. Furthermore, the formation of {332}<113> twins in the tensile process was verified by SEM and EBSD, and the excellent elongation of the Ti–15Mo alloy was confirmed. This work is expected to lay the foundation for manufacturing excellent performing DED metastable β-titanium (Ti) alloys. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Directed energy deposition; Microstructure; Tensile property; Thermal cycles; Ti–15Mo","Deposition; Tensile strength; Thermal cycling; Titanium alloys; Directed energy; Directed energy deposition; Energy depositions; Metastables; Microstructure characterization; Properties of titania; Thermal; Thermal cycle; Titania; Titania–15mo; Microstructure","","","","","Science and Technology Plan of Xi'an City, (2021108, 21CXLHTJSGG-QCY8-0003, 21ZCZZHXJS-QCY6-0001); Science and Technology on Plasma Dynamics Laboratory; Northwestern Polytechnical University, NPU, (SKLSP202110); State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing, SKLSP; Air Force Engineering University, AFEU, (N0614220206021804)","This work was supported by the fund of the Science and Technology on Plasma Dynamics Laboratory (Air Force Engineering University) ( N0614220206021804 ), State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing, Northwestern Polytechnical University ) ( SKLSP202110 ), Science and Technology Plan of Xi'an City ( 21ZCZZHXJS-QCY6-0001 , 21CXLHTJSGG-QCY8-0003 ), and China CEEC University Joint Education Project ( 2021108 ).","Xiang L., Min X., Mi G.B., Application and research process of body-centered-cubic Ti-Mo base alloys, J.

However, pore irregularity as a critical characteristic has been poorly explored. This study proposed a method for parametrically designing porous scaffolds based on a Voronoi tessellation which were manufactured by selective laser sintering (SLS) using the polyamide 12 (PA12) material. The deformation mechanism and energy absorption properties of the prepared Voronoi scaffolds were investigated by quasi-static compression experiments. The results demonstrated that the Voronoi scaffold underwent bending deformation subsequent to transverse expansion under compression, and the Voronoi scaffold simultaneously had been indicated to be effective in improving the carrying capacity and energy absorption performance. Subsequently, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and cell proliferation tests were introduced to comprehensively assess the influence of the scaffolds on cell growth. CFD analysis showed that the permeability of the surveyed scaffolds is between 3.65 × 10−8 and 12.05 × 10−8 m2 similar to that of natural cancellous bone. The cell test expressed that the scaffold exhibits good cell activity, which can be used to promote cell adhesion and migration with superior potential for development and application. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Bone and Bones; Engineering; Humans; Permeability; Porosity; Tissue Engineering; Bone; Cell adhesion; Cell proliferation; Computational geometry; Deformation; Energy absorption; Laser heating; Mechanical permeability; Porosity; Scaffolds (biology); Sintering; Tissue regeneration; Bone tissue; Bone tissue engineering; Guided bone regeneration; Human bones; Mechanical; Permeability properties; Porous scaffold; Porous structures; Voronoi; Voronoi tessellations; bone; engineering; human; permeability; porosity; tissue engineering; Computational fluid dynamics","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51775069); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","The study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51775069).","Bose S., Sarkar N., Trends Biotechnol., 38, pp. 404-417, (2020); Wang Z., Wang J., Jin Y., Luo Z., Yang W., Xie H., Huang K., Wang L., ACS Appl.

The demand for implant in Department of orthopedics has increased. The elastic modulus of the existing solid metal implant is much higher than that of human bone tissue, and it is easy to produce stress shielding effect after operation, which causes complications such as loosening of prosthesis and low fusion efficiency. OBJECTIVE: In order to solve the mismatch of elastic modulus between solid metal orthopedic implants and human bone tissue, metal structures with excellent mechanical properties were prepared. METHODS: The porous structure was designed by spatial dot matrix method, and the metal porous structure was prepared based on selective laser melting 3D printing technology. The residual stress in the preparation process was eliminated by vacuum annealing heat treatment, and the static compression experiment was carried out to study the effects of different pore shape and porosity parameters on the compressive yield strength and elastic modulus of porous structure. The performance changes of porous structure before and after heat treatment were compared, and the porous structure meeting the performance requirements of human bone tissue was selected. RESULTS: The porous structure prepared by selective laser melting technology met the requirements of human bone tissue. The elastic modulus was as low as 0.74 GPa and the compressive yield strength is 201.91 MPa; After annealing heat treatment, the compressive yield strength of porous structure decreased, the maximum change was 3.69%, the elastic modulus increased, and the maximum change was 8.69%. CONCLUSIONS: For the porous structure with the same pore shape, the lower the porosity, the better the mechanical properties of the porous structure. For the same porosity, the comprehensive mechanical properties of dodecahedral porous structure were the best and octahedral porous structure was the worst; the porous structure after annealing heat treatment was more conducive to meet the performance requirements of human bone tissue. © 2022 - IOS Press.

Here, a modified commercial digital light processing (DLP) 3D printer is used to obtain complex macroscopic remotely controlled gear-based devices. The fabrication process is based on the printing of magnetoresponsive polymers containing in situ self-assembled microstructures, i.e., composed of oriented chains of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs). First, it is demonstrated that magnetoresponsive hammer-like actuators with different stiffness can be printed allowing both pure rotation or/and bending motions. Then, the microstructure to create a magnetoresponsive gear is exploited. In particular, this work shows that they can be successfully used to transfer torque to other gears, thereby converting a rotation movement into linear translation. Finally, it is demonstrated that magnetoresponsive gears can also be combined with other nonmagnetic elements to create complex assemblies, such as gear-trains, linear actuators, and grippers that can be remotely controlled. © 2022 The Authors.

Firstly, the FGP parameters of the plate are considered to vary along the thickness direction based on distinct nonlinear porosity distributions. Secondly, the first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) of elasticity, the energy technique, and the calculus of variations are employed to obtain the governing equations of motion. Thirdly, to account for structural damping, the derived equations are extended to constitutive equations using the standard linear solid (SLS) model. Finally, the system of partial differential equations with variable coefficients is analytically solved using the perturbation approach. To do so, the equations with variable coefficients are transformed into a system with constant coefficients by introducing a new parameter, and the lateral dynamic response is determined in a closed-form solution with no approximation. In addition to time-dependent transverse loads, namely transient and impulsive loads, different space-dependent load profiles of constant, linear, parabolic, and sine distributions are also applied on the plate surface. Furthermore, by inserting solution-dependent material properties, a user-defined field (USDFLD) code is provided to evaluate the accuracy of the analytical results in Abaqus/Standard analysis. Ultimately, the influence of different parameters on the dynamic behavior of viscoelastic FGP annular plates is investigated, including the inner-to-outer radius ratio, thickness-to-radius ratio, porosity coefficient, damping parameter, combination of boundary conditions, and porosity pattern. In light of the findings of this study, the asymmetric pattern has the highest vibration amplitude of the different distributions, while the symmetric distribution type 1 has the lowest. Furthermore, for all distributions, raising the void fraction increases the amplitude of vibrations for both transverse and in-plane responses. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Closed-form solution; Dynamic response; Perturbation technique; Porous material; Shear deformation plate theory; Time-dependent property","Beams and girders; Boundary conditions; Calculations; Constitutive equations; Damping; Differentiation (calculus); Dynamic response; Equations of motion; Functionally graded materials; Perturbation techniques; Porosity; Porous plates; Shear deformation; Vibration analysis; Viscoelasticity; Void fraction; Closed form solutions; Functionally graded; Out-of-plane; Radii ratio; Shear deformation plate theories; Thickness direction; Time-dependent properties; Variable coefficients; Viscoelastic plates; Viscoelastics; boundary condition; dynamic response; loading; porous medium; shear; vibration; viscoelasticity; Porous materials","","","","","European Commission, EC, (CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_025/0007293); European Commission, EC; Ministerstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy, MŠMT","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support received from the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports of the Czech Republic and the European Union (European Structural and Investment Funds Operational Program Research, Development, and Education) in the framework of the project “Modular platform for autonomous chassis of specialized electric vehicles for freight and equipment transportation”, Reg.

The formation enthalpies of seven alloys of the Al13(Fe,Co)4 solid solution were measured by DSC at 920 K, allowing the determination of the mixing enthalpy of the solution. These measurements are presented here for the first time and highlight the ideal nature of this solid solution. In addition, the mixing enthalpy of the Al13(Fe,TM)4 solid solutions (TM = Co, Cr, Ni, Pt) was determined by DFT at 0 K. These calculated and measured data (in the case of the Al13(Fe,Co)4 solid solution) were used to perform thermodynamic modelling of the solid solutions and better understand their thermodynamic stability. In addition, our modelling was used to calculate the TM occupancy on the Fe sites of the Al13(Fe,TM)4 solid solution structure at different temperatures. These data were used to quantify the chemical ordering of the solid solutions as a function of temperature. While these solid solutions show significant chemical ordering at low temperatures, only the Al13(Fe,Pt)4 solution remains highly ordered at high temperatures. These data are presented for the first time in this paper and have allowed us to design an optimal sublattice (SL) model for the Al13Fe4 solid solutions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Al13Fe4; Crystal chemistry; DFT calculation; Formation enthalpy measurements; Thermodynamic modelling","Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Cobalt alloys; Crystal chemistry; Density functional theory; Design for testability; Differential scanning calorimetry; Enthalpy; Iron alloys; Mixing; Temperature; Calculation models; Chemical order; Chemistry models; Crystal-chemistry; Density-functional theory calculations; Enthalpy measurements; Formation enthalpy; Formation enthalpy measurement; Mixing enthalpy; Thermodynamic modelling; Solid solutions","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (RGPIN-2017-6 168, ALLRP 560 998 – 20)","We acknowledge the support of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) via the Discovery Grant of Prof. Harvey ( RGPIN-2017-6 168 ).

Under various process parameters, the impacts of SLM producing SiC/AlSi10Mg composites on density, microstructure, tensile characteristics, and fatigue properties were investigated. The results demonstrated that the density of the SiC/AlSi10Mg composites was closely related to the laser energy density. The density of SiC/AlSi10Mg composites might reach 99.7% under the ideal conditions. The Al4SiC4 phase grew with the rise in laser energy density as the aluminum matrix and SiC reacted in situ to generate a new strengthening phase Al4SiC4, which was dispersed on the matrix in a granular way. Therefore, the composite's tensile strength and microhardness reached their maximum values at 190.17HV and 435 MPa, respectively, when the energy density was 151.79J/mm3. This was due to the mixed strengthening mechanism caused by the SiC and Al4SiC4 reinforcing phase Compared with AlSi10Mg alloy, the addition of reinforcing phase SiC could significantly improve the fatigue resistance of composite materials. The fatigue fracture mode was brittle fractures, and the source of the crack was mainly from the surface pore defects. The size of the fatigue source defect size was related to the fatigue performance. The smaller the size of the defect, the more beneficial the fatigue resistance of the composite material. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Fatigue performance; Microstructure; Selective laser melting; SiC/AlSi10Mg composites","Aluminum alloys; Composite materials; Fatigue of materials; Fracture; Melting; Selective laser melting; Silicon; Silicon alloys; Silicon carbide; Tensile strength; Composites material; Fatigue materials; Fatigue performance; Fatigue-resistance; Laser energy density; Material characteristics; Performance characteristics; Reinforcing phase; Selective laser melting; SiC/alsi10mg composite; Microstructure","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52075317); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM, (19511106400, 19511106402)","The author was grateful for the valuable advice of the Dr. Q.

Design/methodology/approach: A case study of a leading original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that uses AM technology to directly produce end-use metal parts for different industries was performed. Primary data were collected using the in-depth interview method, which was complemented by secondary data from internal and publicly available sources. The findings were compared with the existing literature to triangulate the results. Findings: The findings indicate that certain AM adoption barriers make the SC vulnerable to reliance on specialty sources, supplier capacity, production capacity, utilization of restricted materials, importance of product purity, raw material availability, unpredictability in customer demand, reliability of equipment, unforeseen technology failures, reliance on information flow, industrial espionage, and utilities availability. Research limitations/implications: The SCR outcomes of the identified SC vulnerabilities and their interrelated AM adoption barriers are proposed in this study. Practical implications: Drawing on the case study findings and the existing literature, several practices are put forward in a framework that supply chain management (SCM) may use to mitigate the identified SC vulnerabilities caused by the AM adoption barriers. Originality/value: This is the first study to empirically examine and identify the SC vulnerabilities that are caused by the adoption barriers of AM technology. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Adoption barriers; Case study; Mitigation practices; Supply chain resilience; Supply chain vulnerabilities","Additives; Supply chain management; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Additive manufacturing technology; Adoption barriers; Case-studies; Design/methodology/approach; Mitigation practice; Original equipment manufacturers; Supply chain resiliences; Supply chain vulnerability; 3D printers","","","","","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT; Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior, MCTES, (PRT/BD/152828/2021, UIDB/00667/2020)","The first author acknowledges Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT - MCTES) for its financial support via the MIT-Portugal Program (PRT/BD/152828/2021) and the second author via the project UNIDEMI (UIDB/00667/2020).","Astm I., 3, No. 4, (2015); Baumers M., Dickens P., Tuck C., Hague R., The cost of additive manufacturing: machine productivity, economies of scale and technology-push, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 102, pp. 193-201, (2016); Berman B., 3-D printing: the new industrial revolution, Business Horizons, 55, 2, pp. 155-162, (2012); Blackhurst J., Dunn K.S., Craighead C.W., An empirically derived framework of global supply resiliency, Journal of Business Logistics, 32, 4, pp. 374-391, (2011); Chan H.K., Griffin J., Lim J.J., Zeng F., Chiu A.S., The impact of 3D Printing Technology on the supply chain: manufacturing and legal perspectives, International Journal of Production Economics, 205, pp. 156-162, (2018); Chekurov S., Metsa-Kortelainen S., Salmi M., Roda I., Jussila A., The perceived value of additively manufactured digital spare parts in industry: an empirical investigation, International Journal of Production Economics, 205, pp. 87-97, (2018); Chen D., Heyer S., Ibbotson S., Salonitis K., Steingrimsson J.G., Thiede S., Direct digital manufacturing: definition, evolution, and sustainability implications, Journal of Cleaner Production, 107, pp. 615-625, (2015); Colosimo B.M., Cavalli S., Grasso M., A cost model for the economic evaluation of in-situ monitoring tools in metal additive manufacturing, International Journal of Production Economics, 223, (2020); Davies P., Parry G., Alves K., Ng I., How additive manufacturing allows products to absorb variety in use: empirical evidence from the defence industry, Production Planning and Control, 33, 2-3, pp. 175-192, (2022); Delic M., Eyers D.R., The effect of additive manufacturing adoption on supply chain flexibility and performance: an empirical analysis from the automotive industry, International Journal of Production Economics, 228, (2020); Dolgui A., Ivanov D., Exploring supply chain structural dynamics: new disruptive technologies and disruption risks, International Journal of Production Economics, 229, (2020); Durach C.F., Kurpjuweit S., Wagner S.M., The impact of additive manufacturing on supply chains, International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 10, pp. 954-971, (2017); Durao L.F.C., Christ A., Zancul E., Anderl R., Schutzer K., Additive manufacturing scenarios for distributed production of spare parts, The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 93, 1, pp. 869-880, (2017); Dwivedi G., Srivastava S.K., Srivastava R.K., Analysis of barriers to implement additive manufacturing technology in the Indian automotive sector, International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 10, pp. 972-999, (2017); Eisenhardt K.M., Martin J.A., Dynamic capabilities: what are they?, Strategic Management Journal, 21, 10-11, pp. 1105-1121, (2000); El Baz J., Ruel S., Can supply chain risk management practices mitigate the disruption impacts on supply chains' resilience and robustness?

In this work, we contribute to this emerging research by reporting on the production of a composite nylon-based filament for fused deposition modeling incorporating encapsulated PCMs for 3D printing heat sink geometries. Microencapsulated PCM (MEPCM) with a 6 °C transition temperature was selected as the material for thermal energy storage. This transition temperature was selected due to its suitability to provide thermal energy storage to target air-conditioning applications in buildings. In an attempt to improve the thermal conductivity of the composite, fine boron nitride fillers were added, although the effect on improvement was found to be negligible in the overall composite mixture. The nylon-MEPCM ratio in the filaments was optimized, and filaments containing up to 40 wt% MEPCM were successfully synthesized, which were found optimal for 3D printing complex heat sink and other geometries. Thermal and mechanical properties of the filaments were characterized, including latent heat of fusion, thermal conductivity, phase change temperature, tensile strength, and more. Thermal infrared imaging of heat sink geometries printed using the MEPCM filaments undergoing thermal discharging was also conducted. This work presents the most promising result to date in the open literature for a 3D-printed PCM composite in the combination of size, energy density, and geometric complexity of printed parts. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Composite filament; Fused deposition modeling; Phase change material; Polymer heat exchanger; Thermal energy storage","3D modeling; Air conditioning; Deposition; Fused Deposition Modeling; Geometry; Heat sinks; Heat storage; III-V semiconductors; Phase change materials; Polyamides; Rayon; Storage (materials); Temperature; Tensile strength; Thermography (imaging); 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Boron nitride fillers; Complex designs; Composite filament; In-buildings; Manufacturing techniques; Polymer heat exchanger; Synthesised; Thermal energy storage; Thermal energy","","","","","U.S. Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Building Technologies Office and Advanced Manufacturing Office; U.S. Government; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-AC36-08GO28308); National Renewable Energy Laboratory, NREL","This work was authored in part by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, operated by Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC, for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308.

Here, specimens with seven configurations were manufactured and tested to obtain a wide range of stress triaxialities. A combined approach using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and finite element (FE) modelling was used to evaluate the current stress triaxiality levels of the various specimens. The material fracture envelope was defined with the triaxiality in a range from-0.28 to 0.71, noting that the fracture was strongly dependent on the stress triaxiality. The characterisations were then carried out by testing an ad-hoc specimen to evaluate failure criteria at low and high stress triaxialities. It was shown that the FE model using the failure criterion based on triaxiality offers more accurate predictions of the material's failure response than that based on the effective plastic strain. The modelling approach based on anisotropic elasto-plasticity contributes to better predictions of the alloy's response. Thus, the failure models based on the stress triaxiality are highly recommended for producing accurate numerical predictions of the fracture response of Ti6Al4V-EBM. © 2022, Marcílio Alves.

However, due to potential drawbacks and societal change, intensive research has been conducted to replace this material for medical use, as such various promising alloy systems have been proposed. By implementing additive manufacturing (AM) in the value chain of load-bearing implants, the question of the printability of these promising medical alloy systems arose as none were explicitly developed for AM. In a previous paper, an alloy development methodology for AM (NADFAM [Ackers et al., 2021]) was presented, which allows rapid screening of alloys for laser-based powder bed fusion of metals (PBF-LB/M; ISO/ASTM 52911–1). The method was applied to screen several new titanium alloys and rank the alloys according to target properties for PBF-LB/M of load-bearing implants. Following this screening, a novel metastable β-titanium alloy out of the quinary Ti-Ta-Fe-Nb-Zr system was selected for further investigations, and a refined alloy composition Ti-4.5Ta-4Fe-7.5Nb-6Zr (wt%, denoted as TTFNZ) will be presented and compared to Ti64 in this study. The motivation to investigate a system with a lower allotropic transformation temperature (β/α) than Ti64 derived from the idea that (I) it promises reduced cold cracking tendency in the course of rapid solidification (II) common post-print heat treatments could be performed at lower temperatures or could become redundant using printers with a preheating option and (III) it allows exploring a wide range of microstructures and mechanical properties through thermal processing. The present study reports on: (i) AM feedstock/powder production of TTFNZ, (ii) PBF-LB/M process parameter development, (iii) heat treatment optimisation, related microstructures and their effect on mechanical properties tested via indentation, compression and tensile testing. (iv) Corrosion properties and (v) the PVD coatability of TTFNZ were also studied to discuss its amenability for medical and advanced engineering applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Alloy design; Laser processing; Powder bed fusion; Rapid-solidification; Transition metal alloys and compounds","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Biocompatibility; Corrosive effects; Diagnosis; Heat treatment; Iron alloys; Medical applications; Microstructure; Niobium alloys; Powder metals; Rapid solidification; Tantalum alloys; Tensile testing; Titanium alloys; Transition metals; Zircaloy; Advanced engineerings; Alloy designs; Alloy system; Engineering applications; Laser process; Load-bearing; Metastable β titanium alloys; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion; Transition metal alloys and compounds; 3D printers","","","","","Doris Fopp-Spori and Nicola Döbelin; Oerlikon AM Europe GmbH","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Oerlikon AM Europe GmbH , Germany.

In this study, the CoCrFeNiWx (x = 0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.7, and 1.0) HEAs were successfully prepared via the PPA-AM technique. Microstructure and mechanical properties of alloys with different W content were investigated. The results showed that the microstructure changed from a single FCC phase (x = 0) to the dual-phase FCC + µ (x = 0.2 and 0.5), and then to a three-phase combination of FCC + µ + BCC (x = 0.7 and 1.0) with the addition of W. The volume fraction of the µ phase and BCC phase increases with the increase in W content, while the size of FCC columnar grain is significantly reduced. The solid-solution strengthening of the FCC phase and the second phase strengthening were mainly responsible for the increase in the microhardness (136–413 HV) and yield strength (187–567 MPa) while the brittleness of the μ phase contributes to the expansion of the crack, which leads to a decrease in the ductility (50.8% to 0.3%). These results can provide a systematic understanding of the phase transformation of PPA-AM HEAs with different W content and its effects on the mechanical properties. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; High-entropy alloy; Mechanical properties; Microstructure","Additives; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Entropy; Fracture mechanics; High-entropy alloys; Iron alloys; Microstructure; Alloy microstructure; FCC phase; High entropy alloys; High quality; Higher efficiency; Low-costs; Manufacturing IS; Manufacturing techniques; Microstructure evolutions; Plasma arc; 3D printers","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51875213); Wenzhou University, WZU; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2022A1515010065)","Funding text 1: This project is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51875213 ), GuangDong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (No. 2022A1515010065 ).

Herein, a stepwise algorithm-assisted bioprinting technology for the construction of biomimetic tissues with a customizable anisotropic microstructure by combining the Adaptive Mesh Generation algorithm and the Greedy Search algorithm is developed. Based on the mechanical topology optimization design mechanism, the Adaptive Mesh Generation algorithm can generate controllable anisotropic mesh patterns with the minimum free energy in plane models according to tissue-specific requirements. Subsequently, the Greedy Search algorithm can program the generated pattern data into optimized printing paths, effectively avoiding structural deformations caused by the multiple stacking of materials and reducing the printing time. The developed bioprinting technique is suitable for various types of bioinks including polymers, hydrogels, and organic/inorganic complexes. After combining with a calcium phosphorus bioink, the compound algorithm-assisted bioprinting technique successfully customizes femurs with biomimetic chemical compositions, anisotropic microstructures, and biological properties, demonstrating its effectiveness. Additionally, algorithm-assisted bioprinting is generally suitable for most commercial extrusion bioprinters that function in the geometric code (G-code) drive mode. Therefore, the algorithm-assisted extrusion bioprinting technology offers an intelligent manufacturing strategy for the customization of anisotropic microstructures in biomimetic tissues. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","algorithm; anisotropy; biomimetic microstructures; bioprinting; pattern programming","Algorithms; Biomimetics; Bioprinting; Hydrogels; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; Bioinformatics; Biomimetics; Calcium compounds; Digital storage; Extrusion; Free energy; Histology; Learning algorithms; Mesh generation; Microstructure; Tissue; Adaptive mesh generation; Anisotropic microstructures; Anisotropic structure; Biomimetic microstructure; Bioprinting; Greedy search algorithms; Mesh generation algorithm; Pattern programming; Stepwise algorithms; Tissue specifics; algorithm; biomimetics; bioprinting; chemistry; hydrogel; procedures; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; Anisotropy","","Hydrogels, ","","","Foundation of National Facility for Translational Medicine (Shanghai), (TMSK‐2020‐117); GuangCi Professorship Program of Ruijin Hospital Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (82102210); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFB1105600, 2019YFA0112000); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2019YFA0112000 and 2018YFB1105600), National Natural Science Foundation of China (82102210), the Foundation of National Facility for Translational Medicine (Shanghai) (TMSK‐2020‐117), and GuangCi Professorship Program of Ruijin Hospital Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine.

While previous studies on additively manufactured alloy 718 typically have metallic phases only, in this work, we show that oxide nanoparticles can be introduced into alloy 718 via a reactive sintering mechanism. The introduction of micron scale Cr2O3 powder in alloy 718 powder led to the formation of a homogeneous distribution of Al and Ti rich oxide nanoparticles. This surprising finding arises from the chemical reaction between oxide powders and metal matrix containing Al and Ti. In comparison to the control alloy 718 without oxides, the presence of oxide nanoparticles dramatically alters the microstructure, leading to a relatively more equiaxed grain structure, while also reducing the residual stress. While the mechanical testing between the two material groups demonstrates comparable mechanical strength and tensile ductility at room temperature, the high-temperature (900 °C) mechanical properties of the oxide containing 718 samples were significantly improved over the control 718 samples. The apparent possibilities of using this reactive process to introduce oxide nanoparticles into metallic materials may have a general implication for the fabrication of oxide dispersion in various metal matrices via reactive additive manufacturing. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","718 Ni alloy; Mechanical behavior; Oxide dispersion strengthening; Reactive additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum oxide; Chromium alloys; Dispersions; Metal nanoparticles; Metal testing; Nickel alloys; Powder metals; Sintering; Tensile testing; Textures; Titanium alloys; Titanium oxides; 718 ni alloy; Alloy 718; High temperature performance; Mechanical behavior; Metal matrix; Metallic phase; Ni alloys; Oxide dispersion strengthening; Oxide nanoparticles; Reactive additive manufacturing; Metals","","","","","Purdue Internal Funding; Office of Naval Research, ONR, (N00014-17-1-2087, N00014-20-1-2043); Office of Naval Research, ONR; Purdue University, PU","Funding text 1: Stegman and Zhang would like to acknowledge the partial financial support from the Purdue Internal Funding as well as Praxair Surface Technologies for providing the powder and powder processing facilities.

Therefore, accurate measurements and estimations of the phase distribution and topological charge are essential for their applications to ensure VB quality. In this paper, we employed a sinusoidal phase modulation (SPM) interferometry to measure the phase distributions of VBs and the topological charge of VBs were estimated by mean of a method of the process of unwrapped phase. The phase measurement of optical vortices generated by a spatial light modulator (SLM) demonstrated that the SPM interferometry-based technique had a high measurement accuracy with a simplified configuration. The estimation errors of the topological charges for various orders of VBs were within approximately 4%. The fluctuation in the surface of the SLM leading to the flatness of the wavefront was estimated to be 0.06 rad by 10 consecutive measurements. © 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement.","","Interferometry; Light modulation; Light modulators; Optical communication; Optical signal processing; Optical tweezers; Phase measurement; Self phase modulation; Topology; Underwater acoustics; Vortex flow; Light beam; Measurements of; Modulation methods; Optical vortices; Phase distribution; Property; Sinusoidal phase-modulation; Spatial light modulators; Topological charges; Vortex beams; Wavefronts","","","","","","","Berry M.

A preliminary characterization of PPt/r-PP blends at different weight ratios allowed selecting two systems showing adequate rheological behavior for FFF. The selected blends were melt compounded in a twin-screw extruder, optimizing the processing conditions through a design of experiments approach, involving the use of Taguchi’s method. The materials that were prepared with the optimized processing conditions, hence showing the best performance in terms of rheological behavior and thermal characteristics, were then selected for the production of the filament and for the subsequent FFF processing. Finally, the morphology of the filament and the mechanical properties of 3D-printed samples were assessed, demonstrating the achievement of satisfactory results in terms of performances. In general, the obtained results clearly demonstrated that a proper optimization of both material and processing conditions offers the possibility of using recycled PP-based formulations for additive manufacturing processes, hence allowing a remarkable valorization of a low added-value material through its utilization for an innovative and sustainable manufacturing approach. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing; fused filament fabrication; mechanical properties; polypropylene; recycle; rheology","","","","","","","","Iyer K.A., Zhang L., Torkelson J.M., Direct use of natural antioxidant-rich agro-wastes as thermal stabilizer for polymer: Processing and recycling, ACS Sustain.

In sandwich panels, improving the mechanical performance of the face sheets is almost exhausted due to using ultra-high-strength materials. By contrast, the sandwich core offers a high light-weight potential when it constitutes the largest part of the total weight of the sandwich. Novel structures such as lattices can significantly enhance the core's mechanical performance. Lattice structures fabricated by additive manufacturing (AM) provide comparable mechanical properties to honeycombs and allow multifunctional use of the core. Another benefit of using AM is the ability to customize the core mechanical properties. Such a design could be achieved by using a functionally graded lattice core. In this work, an analytical model is derived to determine stresses and deformations in graded lattice cores of sandwich panels. Compared to the classical sandwich theory, the presented model enables the determination of the out-of-plane stresses near the load application areas. Furthermore, evaluating the stresses in the lattice struts of the graded core highlights the benefits of using graded cores in sandwich panels since the stress in graded cores exhibits a more homogeneous distribution, enabling better material exploitation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Graded core;

A series of as-fabricated and after-heated samples were additively manufactured from two high-strength metals (i.e., IN718 and 17-4PH) by selective laser melting (SLM) technique. The microstructure of HOCM samples, and the post-fracture of parent materials were characterized. Quasi-static out-of-plane compressive behavior of the HOCM structures was experimentally and numerically investigated, with an excellent agreement between the measurements and FE simulations. Effects of relative density and parent material (especially the heat treatment) on the compressive properties were explored in terms of deformation mechanism, compressive strength and energy absorption. The layer-by-layer small-scale folding deformation dominating in the crushing process contributes to a relatively high and long stress-plateau stage, which leads to the excellent energy absorption. The heat treatment of the HOCM samples increases the compressive strength, but might not benefit the energy absorption. The IN718 and 17-4PH hierarchical origami-corrugation metallic sandwiches exhibit very competitive mechanical properties compared to cellular topologies, and possess great potential as lightweight load-bearing and energy-absorbent engineering components. © 2022","Compressive strength; Energy absorption; Heat treatment; Hierarchical origami-corrugation metallic sandwich","Deformation; Energy absorption; Heat treatment; Melting; Metals; Selective laser melting; Compressive performance; Hierarchical origami-corrugation metallic sandwich; High-strength; Melting techniques; Metallics; Parent materials; Post-fracture; Selective laser melting; Small scale; Structure-based; Compressive strength","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11802221, 51875441); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (xtr012019004, zrzd2017027); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (11802221, and 51875441), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (grant numbers xtr012019004 and zrzd2017027).

The study aims to critically evaluate the effect of different sterilization and disinfection methods for most commonly used additive manufacturing technologies and materials in medical device development: PLA (polylactic acid), PETG (polyethylene terephthalate glycol), ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene), and HIPS (high impact polystyrene) for material extrusion technology (FFF; fused filament fabrication), polyamide (PA2200) for powder bed fusion technology (SLS; selective laser sintering), MED610™ for PolyJet™ material jetting, and standard Formlabs™ white resin (V4) for SLA (stereolithography) technology. The materials were tested before and after different sterilization and disinfection protocols, including treatment with 70% ethanol, chlorine solution, H2O2 plasma sterilization, autoclave and dry heat sterilization, applying 10 and 20 cycles in all cases. Bacteriostatic/fungistatic and sterility tests were performed using Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans as reference strains. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using A549 cells. The samples showed significant structural or aesthetic alterations detected by various mechanical tests, scanning electron microscopy, or differential scanning calorimetry (DSC-TGA). No significant cytotoxic effect was revealed during the experiment. Our results can serve as a guide for the selection of effective sterilization and disinfection methods for the most common materials used in 3D printing in medical and healthcare applications. © 2022 The Author(s)","3D Printing; Additive Manufacturing; Cytotoxicity; Disinfection; Mechanical test; Medical device; Polymer; Sterilization; Structural analysis","Additives; Differential scanning calorimetry; Disinfection; Escherichia coli; Functional polymers; Laser heating; Scanning electron microscopy; Sintering; Sterilization (cleaning); Styrene; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Additive manufacturing technology; Disinfection methods; Health care application; Mechanical; Mechanical test; Medical Devices; State of the art; Thermoplastic polymer; 3D printers","","","","","University of Pecs; University of Pécs Medical School, (2020-4.1.1-TKP2020); Pécsi Tudományegyetem, PTE, (EFOP-3.6.1-16-2016-00004, GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00022, KA-2019-40, KA-2020-09); Pécsi Tudományegyetem, PTE","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the EFOP-3.6.1-16-2016-00004, GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00022, UP MS grants KA-2019-40, KA-2020-09, and Thematic excellence program-TKP2021-NVA-06” Establishment of the Center of Excellence in Defense Health at the University of Pécs Medical School.

The effect of different scanning strategies on the evolution of the microstructure and properties of Cu-Cr-Zr alloys manufactured by laser powder bed fusion was explored. The microstructure, electrical conductivity and mechanical properties of the specimens exhibited different anisotropy under different scanning strategies. Compared with specimens using the meander scanning strategy, the epitaxially grown columnar grains on the vertical plane of specimens using the chessboard scanning strategy are significantly tortuous. The strength anisotropy of the specimen can be attributed to the combined effect of the anisotropy of the strengthening mechanism and crystallographic texture. The anisotropy of the ductility of the specimen can be attributed to the anisotropy of the deformation mechanism of the grains and the difference in the fracture mechanism. The anisotropy of the electrical conductivity of the specimen can be attributed to the different degrees of lattice distortion. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Anisotropy; Cu-Cr-Zr; Laser powder bed fusion; Microstructure; Properties; Scanning strategy","Chromium alloys; Copper alloys; Electric conductivity; Scanning; Ternary alloys; Textures; Zircaloy; Cu-Cr-Zr; Electrical conductivity; Epitaxially grown; Evolution of the microstructure; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Microstructure and properties; Powder bed; Property; Scanning strategies; Anisotropy","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52171044); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","The authors are grateful to the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52171044 ).","Leon K.V., Munoz-Morris M.A., Morris D.G., Optimisation of strength and ductility of Cu–Cr–Zr by combining severe plastic deformation and precipitation, Mater.

The results showed that the as-LPBFed Al-5Mg2Si-2Mg alloy was featured by the refined compact Al-cells and the divorced Mg2Si eutectic network. After solution at 490 ºC for 1 h, the Mg2Si eutectics were broken to form coarse Mg2Si particles. On the contrary, the characteristics of as-aged microstructure included the heritage of Al-cells and divorced Mg2Si eutectics, and the newly formed ultrafine in-situ Mg2Si particles in the matrix. Tensile results indicated that solution with and without subsequent ageing are not effective for strength improvement. The relative density, yield strength and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of as-LPBFed alloy decreased obviously from 99.25 %, 295 MPa, and 453 MPa to 98.75 %, 167 MPa, and 292 MPa, respectively. On the other hand, the yield strength of 377 MPa, UTS of 488 MPa and elongation of 9.6 % can be achieved after direct ageing at 180 ºC for 3.5 h, showing 28 % increase of yield strength in comparison with as-LPBFed alloy, but still with excellent ductility for engineering applications. It is found that the enhanced mechanical properties are mainly attributed to the newly formed ultrafine in-situ Mg2Si particles. From the results above, the direct ageing was found as a suitable heat treatment method capable of enhancing the strength of as-LPBFed Al-5Mg2Si-2Mg alloy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Aluminium alloys; Heat treatment; Laser powder bed fusion; Mechanical properties; Microstructure","Aluminum alloys; Biomechanics; Eutectics; Magnesium alloys; Microstructure; Silicon alloys; Tensile strength; Yield stress; AL cell; Direct aging; Effect of heat treatments; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Powder bed; Ultimate tensile strength; Ultra-fines; Ultrafine; Heat treatment","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52071343); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2020YFB0311300ZL); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","Financial support from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2020YFB0311300ZL ), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52071343 ) are gratefully acknowledged.","Prillhofer R., Rank G., Berneder J., Antrekowitsch H., Uggowitzer P.J., Pogatscher S., Property criteria for automotive Al-Mg-Si sheet alloys, Materials, 7, pp. 5047-5068, (2014); Hanemann T., Carter L.N., Habschied M., Adkins N.J.E., Attallah M.M., Heilmaier M., In-situ alloying of AlSi10Mg+Si using selective laser melting to control the coefficient of thermal expansion, J.

Further, this work bridges the gap between the additive process conditions (time-temperature history) and the effective layer-to-layer fracture properties developed within a printed component. This is the first step to predict delamination that can occur during printing, during cooling to room temperature after printing, and during service performance of an additively manufactured geometry. A phenomenological model is developed for fusion bonding of semi-crystalline polymer matrix composites by coupling the interdiffusion of polymer chains with the evolution of polymer crystallinity. While the interdiffusion is captured by reptation theory of polymer dynamics, the evolution of crystallinity is modeled by phenomenological crystallization kinetics and crystal melting dynamics. Further, a methodology is developed to determine the critical strain energy release rate, GICof the interlayer interface and experiments are conducted utilizing the double cantilever beam fracture test geometry. Predictions of GIC as a function of thermal history are compared with experiments. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Extrusion deposition additive manufacturing; Fiber-reinforced semi-crystalline polymers; Fusion bonding; Interlayer fracture toughness","Additives; Cantilever beams; Crystallinity; Crystallization kinetics; Deposition; Extrusion; Fused Deposition Modeling; Polymer matrix composites; Reinforced plastics; Strain energy; Strain rate; Additive manufacturing process; Extrusion deposition additive manufacturing; Fiber-reinforced semi-crystalline polymer; Fibre-reinforced; Fusion bonding; Interlayer fracture toughness; Properties of fiber; Semi-crystalline polymer; Semi-crystalline polymer composites; Toughness properties; Fracture toughness","","","","","IACMI; Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE","The authors have no conflicts of interest related to this publication.

Tensile, and fatigue crack growth (FCG) testing was carried out in both horizontal and vertical build orientations with the condition at 25 °C and 500 °C. Three regions can be detected in the specimen: the additive manufacturing zone (AM), the heat affected zone (HAZ) and the substrate. M23C6 and M6C carbides were found in the specimens, only a small amount of hole defects was observed in the samples, and no cracks were found. The tensile test results show that the specimens have obvious anisotropy, and the horizontal specimens displayed higher strength (up to 855.3 MPa ultimate tensile strength at 25 °C). It is worth noting that there is no obvious anisotropy in the FCG rates of the specimens in different directions, and only when the ΔK is about 45–60 MPa m1/2, the FCG rates of the vertical specimens are higher. The increase in temperature will significantly reduce the tensile performance and increase the FCG rate of the specimens. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Fatigue crack growth; GH3536 alloy; High-temperature alloys; Laser solid forming","Anisotropy; Carbides; Fabrication; Fatigue crack propagation; Heat affected zone; Nickel alloys; Substrates; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Build orientation; Condition; Crack free; Fatigue crack growth rates; Gh3536 alloy; Growth testing; Laser solid forming; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Nickel-based superalloys; Tensile crack; Superalloys","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51901252); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Central South University, CSU; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2019JJ50817, 2020JJ5713); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province; National Defense Basic Scientific Research Program of China, (JCKY2020208B020); National Defense Basic Scientific Research Program of China","This work was supported financially by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 51901252 , the National Defense Basic Scientific Research Program of China under Grant JCKY2020208B020 , the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province under Grant No. 2020JJ5713 , No. 2019JJ50817 and the Open Sharing Fund for the Large-scale Instruments and Equipments of Central South University.","Ivekovi A., Montero-Sistiaga M.L., Vleugels J., Kruth J.P., Vanmeensel K., Crack mitigation in laser powder bed fusion processed hastelloy X using a combined numerical-experimental approach, J.

Assessing the internal state of reused cells is key not only at the repurposing stage but also during their SL operation. As an alternative of the traditional capacity tests used to this end, the estimation of State of Health (SOH) allows to reduce the testing time and the need of equipment, thereby reinforcing the economic success of SL batteries. However, the estimation of SOH in real SL operation has been rarely analysed in literature. This contribution aims thus to cover this gap, by focusing on the experimental assessment of SOH estimation in reused modules from Nissan Leaf EVs under two SL scenarios: a residential household with self-consumption and a fast charge station for EVs. By means of partial charge and experimental data from cycling and calendar ageing tests, accuracy and robustness of health indicators is firstly assessed. Then, SOH estimation is carried out using real profiles, covering a SOH range from 91.3 to 31%. Offline assessment led to RMSE values of 0.6% in the residential profile and 0.8% in the fast charge station, with a reduction in testing times of 85% compared to a full capacity test. In order to avoid the interruption of battery operation, online assessment in profiles was also analysed, obtaining RMSE values below 1.3% and 3.6% in the residential and charging station scenarios, respectively. Therefore, the feasibility of SOH estimation in SL profiles is highlighted, as it allows to get accurate results reducing testing times or even without interrupting normal operation. © 2022 The Author(s)","Fast charge station; Lithium-ion battery; Residential storage; Second-life batteries; State of health estimation","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Digital storage; Health; Housing; Ions; Economic viability; Fast charge station; Fast charges; Internal state; Residential storage; Second Life; Second life batteries; State of health; State of health estimation; Testing time; data set; electric vehicle; fuel cell; viability; Lithium-ion batteries","","","","","MCIN; Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI; Universidad Pública de Navarra, UPNA; STARDUST; Horizon 2020; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (774094, 0011-1411-2022-000039); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020","Funding text 1: This work is part of the projects PID2019-111262RB-I00, funded by MCIN/AEI, Spain / 10.13039/501100011033/ , STARDUST ( 774094 ), funded by European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, HYBPLANT ( 0011-1411-2022-000039 ), funded by Government of Navarre, Spain , and a Ph.D. scholarship, also funded by Government of Navarre.

Then, these CNT coated SGF (CNT-SGF) reinforced polylactic acid (PLA) composite filaments were processed as a new fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printing feedstock. Tensile tests were conducted on FDM 3D-printed specimens with two raster angles (±45° and 0°/90°) each containing pure PLA filaments, SGF/PLA and CNT-SGF/PLA composite filaments separately. Compared to the pure 3D-printed PLA samples, experimental results showed that the 3D-printed specimens using SGFs (≥5 wt%) and CNT-SGFs (1–5 wt%) reinforced PLA filaments exhibited higher Young's modulus and tensile strength values due to the enhanced interface adhesion. Furthermore, the FDM printing raster angles (±45° and 0°/90°) did not noticeably affect the tensile properties of the samples made of the same material, which could be attributed to the complete fusion between adjacent rasters during printing. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images on the fracture surfaces of the tensile specimens indicated that the filler distribution within the printed samples was random. Theoretical calculations of the Young's modulus and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation on SGF reinforced PLA samples further verified a random distribution of the fillers within the matrix due to the high printer nozzle diameter to SGF length ratio compared to the short SGF aspect ratio. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","A.

However, with the rapid development of aerospace equipment, it has become increasingly difficult to meet the requirements of integrated design and manufacturing of metal parts by using LPBF or DED alone. LPBF/DED hybrid laser additive manufacturing technology is expected to greatly improve the overall manufacturing capacity of metal components by combining the advantages of the two technologies. It is expected to break through the limitation of overall manufacturing size, to realize the manufacturing of large and complex aerospace parts, and to reduce the number of components required for large and complex structures to meet the overall design and manufacturing requirements. In this paper, AlSi10Mg was selected as the build material for the LPBF/DED hybrid laser additive manufacturing process and the microstructure and mechanical properties of the as-built samples were studied. The analyses of the microstructure show that there are no obvious defects at the interface between the LPBF zone and the DED zone. Although the phase compositions of both the LPBF zone and the DED zone are composed of alpha-Al matrix and eutectic Si, the melt track shape, microstructural morphology, grain size, grain boundary angle distribution and grain texture change significantly around the LPBF/DED interface. The results of mechanical property tests indicated that the LPBF zone has higher microhardness and tensile strength but lower elongation in comparison with the DED zone. The fine microstructure containing a large number of Si-rich nano-precipitates and high amount of solid solution element enhance the microhardness and tensile strength of the LPBF zone, where the lower solid solubility and high percentage of low angle grain boundary increased the elongation of the DED zone. More importantly, the tensile strength of the LPBF/DED interface is not less than the DED zone, and the boundary of DED melt track as well as porosity defect in the DED zone are the weakest region of LPBF/DED hybrid laser additive manufacturing AlSi10Mg specimens. Therefore, the overall tensile strength of the sample is mainly determined by the DED zone. The formation mechanism of the gradient microstructure around the LPBF/DED interface and the effect of microstructure on properties were also analyzed. This paper proves that the LPBF/DED hybrid laser additive manufacturing technology can be used for the overall manufacturing of aluminum alloy components with regular surface structure. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","AlSi10Mg; Direct energy deposition (DED); Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF); LPBF/DED hybrid laser additive manufacturing; Microstructure and mechanical property","3D printers; Additives; Deposition; Grain boundaries; Metals; Microhardness; Morphology; Powder metals; Textures; Direct energy deposition; Energy depositions; Hybrid lasers; Laser additive manufacturing; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powder bed fusion/direct energy deposition hybrid laser additive manufacturing; Laser powders; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Powder bed; Tensile strength","","","","","Huazhong University of Science and Technology, HUST, (2021XXJS029); Huazhong University of Science and Technology, HUST; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFB1103800); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Major Science and Technology Projects of China, (Y2019-VII-0011-0151); National Major Science and Technology Projects of China","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFB1103800 ), the National Science and Technology Major Project (Grant No. Y2019-VII-0011-0151 ), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, HUST (Grant No. 2021XXJS029 ).","Thijs L., Kempen K., Kruth J.P., Humbeeck J.V., Fine-structured aluminium products with controllable texture by selective laser melting of pre-alloyed AlSi10Mg powder, Acta Mater., 61, pp. 1809-1819, (2013); Gu D.D., Shi X.Y., Poprawe R., Bourell D.L., Setchi R., Zhu J.H., Material-structure-performance integrated laser-metal additive manufacturing, Science, 372, (2021); Revilla R., Calster M.V., Raes M., Arroud G., Andreatta F., Pyl L., Guillaume P., Graeve I.D., Microstructure and corrosion behavior of 316L stainless steel prepared using different additive manufacturing methods: a comparative study bringing insights into the impact of microstructure on their passivity, Sci.

Extant studies on OEF models mostly utilize the finite difference method (FDM) to address partial-differential-equation (PDE) constraints related to the dynamics in natural gas networks (NGNs) and district heating networks (DHNs). However, this time-domain approach suffers from a heavy computational burden with regard to achieving high finite-difference accuracy. In this paper, a novel OEF model that formulates NGN and DHN constraints in the frequency domain and corresponding model compaction techniques for efficient solving are contributed. First, an energy circuit method (ECM) that algebraizes the PDEs of NGNs and DHNs in the frequency domain is introduced. Then, an ECM-based OEF model is formulated, which contains fewer variables and constraints than an FDM-based OEF model and thereby yields better solving efficiency. Finally, variable space projection is employed to remove implicit variables, by which another constraint generation algorithm is enabled to remove redundant constraints. These two techniques further compact the OEF model and bring about a second improvement in solving efficiency. Numerical tests on actual systems indicate the final OEF model reduces variables and constraints by more than 95% and improves the solving efficiency by more than 10 times. In conclusion, the proposed OEF model and solving techniques well meet the optimization needs of large-scale IESs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Energy Circuit; Frequency Domain; Integrated Energy System; Model Compaction;

The development of Scalmalloy which has scandium element broadens the applications for additive manufacturing (AM) for scandium–aluminum alloys. In this research, Scalmalloy is processed by the laser-melting deposition (LMD) method. A fully equiaxed grain microstructure is identified and its formation related to the characteristics of LMD-processing method is discussed. The morphology and distribution of Al3Sc and Al3Zr after processing is observed and discussed, and the elemental distribution is analysed. The high mechanical properties are reached and their relation to the microstructure of the Scalmalloy processed is investigated.

Effects of surface morphology and coating thickness on surface roughness and corrosion resistance are systematically studied. Results show that the two-step surface treatment weakens the step effect of the original sample surface distinctively. Meanwhile, the MAO coating can improve the corrosion resistance of the original sample significantly. The corrosion current density Icorr of SLM specimen- is reduced from 6.212 × 10−5 A/cm2 to 2.493 × 10−7 A/cm2 (t = 15 min), and the Icorr of SEBM specimen- is reduced from 8.013 × 10−6 A/cm2 to 2.562 × 10−6 A/cm2 (t = 15 min). © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","AM; Corrosion resistance; TC4; Two-step surface treatment","Corrosion resistant alloys; Corrosion resistant coatings; Melting; Morphology; Selective laser melting; Surface defects; Surface morphology; Surface resistance; Surface roughness; Surface treatment; Thickness measurement; AM; Microarc oxidation; Original sample; Selective electron beam melting; Selective laser melting; Step surface; Surface treatment technology; TC4; TC4 alloys; Two-step surface treatment; Corrosion resistance","","","","","National Key R&D Program-National Key R&D Program Cooperation Unit Project, (2021YFB3701802-03, 2021YFB3701903-03); Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education-Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education Industrialization Project, (21JC015); Xi'an Science and Technology Plan Project 2021, (21XJZZ0051); National Outstanding Youth Science Fund Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China, IUSS, (2121XJZZ0034, 52104341); National Outstanding Youth Science Fund Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China, IUSS; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51874225); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Xi'an University of Technology, XUT, (252062101, 252062102); Xi'an University of Technology, XUT","This research was funded by the National Key R&D Program-National Key R&D Program Cooperation Unit Project (No. 2021YFB3701903-03 ， 2021YFB3701802-03 ), General Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51874225 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China Youth Science Fund Project (No. 52104341 ), Xi'an Municipal-Achievement Office-Advanced Manufacturing Technology Research Project (No. 2121XJZZ0034 ), Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education-Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education Industrialization Project (No. 21JC015 ), Xi'an Science and Technology Plan Project 2021 (No. 21XJZZ0051 ), Xi'an University of Technology Graduate Research Fund Project (No. 252062101 ) and Xi'an University of Technology Graduate Research Fund Project (No. 252062102).

Drill type, cutting speed and feed were determined as evaluation parameters. Multilayer perceptron (MLP), Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) and fuzzy-Mamdani methods were used in the study. In the estimation of Ra, a MAPE value of 0.206 % for MLP and 8 % for Mamdani was obtained. 100 % success was achieved in the classification made with LVQ. The ANN model accurately predicted Ra with excellent nonlinear mapping ability and an error of 4.9 %. It has been demonstrated that the presented models for drilling SLM-Ti6Al4V parts produced with unsupported front holes instead of drilling full holes can determine the appropriate drilling parameters for the desired Ra. The forecast results and presented models can be applied in drilling process planning for target industrial applications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","ANN; Drilling; Pre-hole features; SLM-Ti6Al4V; Surface roughness","Fuzzy inference; Infill drilling; Selective laser melting; Surface roughness; Titanium alloys; Hole feature; Learning Vector Quantization; Mamdani; Modelling and predictions; Multilayers perceptrons; Pre-hole feature; Pre-holes; Selective laser melting; Selective laser melting-ti6al4v; Surface roughness (Ra); Aluminum alloys","","","","","Kutahya Dumlupınar University, (2020-13)","This study was supported by Kutahya Dumlupınar University , Scientific Research Projects Coordination with the Project numbered 2020-13 .","Xu J., Ji M., Chen M., On the quantitative analysis of drill edge wear when machining CFRP/Ti6Al4V stacks, Int.

In this work, a closed cell foam structure elaborately designed by shrinking Voronoi tessellation to achieve the precise control of microstructure and porosity is fabricated by laser additive manufacturing. Then, the porous metal foam is integrated with paraffin to form the CPCM system. The melting behavior of the system involving conjugate heat transfer with phase change is investigated experimentally and numerically under the three heating conditions, including bottom, lateral and top heating. Further, the influences of foam microstructures are discussed to deeply understand the melting performance of paraffin in the system. Compared with pure paraffin, the present CPCM system can significantly save up to 98 % of the melting time for the case of top heating and can provide more uniform melting profile parallel to the heating direction. Moreover, the presence of metal foam greatly alleviates the melting performance difference of paraffin induced by heating directions. The benefits would provide tunable melting performance of PCMs for diverse applications. © 2022","Enhanced heat transfer; Heating directions; Melting performance; Metal foam; Phase change material","Conversion efficiency; Heat storage; Heating; Melting; Metal foams; Metals; Microstructure; Paraffins; Thermal conductivity; Composite phase change materials; Enhanced heat transfer; Experimental investigations; Heating conditions; Heating direction; Material systems; Melting performance; Metal foams; Numerical investigations; Thermal energy storage; Phase change materials","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12072107); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Science and Technology Program of Hunan Province, (222102320201); Science and Technology Program of Hunan Province","We gratefully acknowledge the financial supports provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 12072107 ) and Key Science and Technology Program of Henan Province, China (No. 222102320201 ).","Liu Z., Yu Z., Yang T., Qin D., Li S., Zhang G., Haghighat F., Joybari M.M., A review on macro-encapsulated phase change material for building envelope applications, Build.

Different from traditional counterpart, the AM 17-4 PH steel exhibits a peculiar dual-phase microstructure containing large amount of retained austenite (66 vol%) and the rest martensite. This metastable structure is highly susceptible to surface polishing, thus widely scattered data of phase constitution are reported in many previous papers. It is found that the thermal martensite transformation is suppressed by the ultra-fine microstructure produced by LPBF, thus giving rise to a large amount of austenite retained. And as a consequence, plastic deformation of the AM 17-4 steel displays an obvious three-stage behavior: (I) yield plateau, (II) severe work hardening, and (III) final necking. Underlying mechanisms are revealed, respectively. At the beginning of plastic deformation, because there is lacking of further strengthening mechanism upon yielding in the fine-grained structure, a plastic instability caused by local softening occurs and leads to the formation of complex Lüders band. When the accumulated mechanical energy plus the intrinsic chemical energy exceeds activation energy of martensite transformation, further plastic deformation results in severe strain-induced martensite transformation (SIMT). The SIMT endows the AM 17-4 steel with extremely high work hardening ability in stage II, consequently, flow stress rises sharply from 490 MPa to the maximum level of 1090 MPa, and most of the retained austenite is exhausted in this stage. Afterward, the work hardening rate drops below the true stress, an increase in strain produces no additional load increase, local necking occurs and leads to final rupture of the AM 17-4 steel. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","17-4 PH stainless Steel; Complex lüders band; Laser powder bed fusion; Retained austenite; Strain-induced martensitic transformation","Activation energy; Austenite; Austenitic transformations; Martensite; Martensitic transformations; Microstructure; Plastic deformation; 17-4 PH stainless steel; Complex luders band; Large amounts; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Luders band; Martensite transformations; Powder bed; Retained austenite; Strain induced martensitic transformation; Strain hardening","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51971149); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2019A1515110515)","This work was financially supported by the projects of the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51971149 ) and Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province ( 2019A1515110515 ).","Liu Z., Zhao D., Wang P., Yan M., Yang C., Chen Z., Lu J., Lu Z., Additive manufacturing of metals: microstructure evolution and multistage control, J.

In this research, a civil engineering application of AM is investigated, where thirty small-scale cement mortar prisms reinforced with 3D-printed thermoplastics were tested in flexure. Rebar-like reinforcement were printed using a fused deposition modeling (FDM) printer. Five different thermoplastics were used with three different surface morphologies, obtained by introducing lugs on the rebar surface. The lugs were intended to enhance the reinforcement-matrix bond. Beams were tested in a three-point bending configuration to assess their load–deflection response and flexural ductility. In general, the introduction of lugs increased the load-carrying capacity of the specimen, between 40 and 120%. The ductility of beams was calculated based on displacement and energy methods. Due to the lack of a definite yield point in such composites, modifications to well-established ductility calculation methods are proposed here. The results indicate the capability of thermoplastics to reinforce mortar beams in flexure. Surface morphology has shown to be significantly influential for most of the thermoplastics considered in this study in terms of strength gain and ductility. © 2022 Institution of Structural Engineers","3D printing; Additive Manufacturing; Ductility; Flexure; Polymers; Surface morphology","","","","","","Sustainable Construction Materials and Structural Systems; University of Sharjah, UOS, (19020401140)","The authors would like to acknowledge the support provided by the Sustainable Construction Materials and Structural Systems (SCMASS) research group at the University of Sharjah.

Based on the finite element theory and Bloch's theorem, a dynamic model of the 3D chiral mechanical metamaterial is established to analyze the band structures and transmission responses. The isotactic configuration converts longitudinal waves into transverse waves due to the chirality, which results in the vibration attenuation of the longitudinal wave that is independent on band gaps. The band gaps appear at the band structures of the syndiotactic configuration, and the generation mechanism is related to the vibration mode of ligaments, which can be used to predict band gap. The samples were manufactured by additive manufacturing to vibration transmission test for verifying the dynamic responses and the band gaps of the 3D chiral mechanical metamaterial with different tacticities. In addition, the gradient design and programmable design are used to further expand the vibration attenuation region, which has the potential for practical applications of vibration suppression. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3D chiral mechanical metamaterial; Band gap; Vibration attenuation; Wave propagation","Energy gap; Transmissions; Vibrations (mechanical); Wave propagation; 3d chiral mechanical metamaterial; Chiral units; Connection forms; Dynamics properties; Finite element theories; Longitudinal waves; Mechanical; Tacticities; Vibration attenuation; Vibration isolations; Metamaterials","","","","","Innovation Foundation for Doctor Dissertation of Northwestern Polytechnical University, (CX2021069); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11872313, 12172297); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","Funding for this work has been sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 12172297 and 11872313) and Innovation Foundation for Doctor Dissertation of Northwestern Polytechnical University (grant number: CX2021069).","Puppi D., Chiellini F., Biodegradable Polymers for Biomedical Additive Manufacturing, Appl.

Therefore, many railways have been built in urban and rural areas to improve interstate connectivity in Malaysia. However, train noise generated from train movement can disturb the comfort of nearby residents that live near railways. This study was conducted nearby the residential area between the Kluang – Renggam rail line to investigate the noise level and compare the existing noise level with the guideline from the Department of Environment (DOE) and World Health Organization (WHO) limits. The measurement data was taken by using the Sound Level Meter (SLM) type of SLM-25 at three different locations with distance of 20 m, 30 m, and 55 m away from the train track during morning, noon, and evening. The result shows the maximum value is 102.6 dBA during the evening at point 1 with a distance of 20 m. The residential area at point 1 which is 20 m distance between rail track and point 2 with the distance of 30 m from the rail track was indicated exposed to train noise disturbance whereby the measurement data for each location was exceeded the permissible noise for DOE and WHO which is 60 dBA and 54 dBA. The result can show that the noise level was dependent on the distance of the receiver to the train track. A better method such as developed noise mapping and the questionnaire of annoyance level for the residential area can improve the findings on the effect of train noise in the future. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office.","permissible noise; residential area; Train noise","","","","","","Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, UTHM, (H753)","Funding text 1: This research was supported by Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM) through Tier 1 (Vot H753).; Funding text 2: This research was supported by Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM) through Tier 1 (Vot H753)","Clausen U., Doll C., Franklin F.

To predict residual stress with accuracy and efficiency, this work has developed an innovative modeling approach by incorporating the scanning strategy.

In addition, honeycombs play a critical role when passive protection is required due to their low density and high energy absorption capabilities. With the transition of additive manufacturing from a rapid prototyping approach to a manufacturing process, this technology has recently offered designers and manufacturers the ability to fabricate and modify lattice structures such as honeycombs. The current study presents the application of laser powder bed fusion, a common additive manufacturing process for producing industrial metal components, for fabricating metal honeycombs. In addition, this study examines three modified designs that can only be practically fabricated using additive manufacturing and compares them with conventional honeycombs. For this purpose, quasi-static and dynamic compression tests are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of the honeycomb structures. The results show that the structures produced by additive manufacturing have acceptable performance compared to conventional honeycomb structures, and laser powder bed fusion can be considered to be a reliable manufacturing method for honeycomb production. Furthermore, the honeycombs produced according to the modified designs generally outperformed their counterparts made from the typical hexagonal cells. Ultimately, the use of triangular cells as a design modification is proposed to produce honeycombs with promising performance characteristics in all of their principal axes and under various pressure scenarios, from quasi-static to dynamic loading rates. Finally, this study also investigates the applicability of a newly developed maraging steel for additive manufacturing of honeycombs. Microstructural analysis and quasi-static tensile tests have confirmed the material properties for this purpose. © 2022 The Author(s)","Compression; Digital manufacturing; Honeycomb structures; Impact; Laser powder bed fusion; Strain rate","3D printers; Additives; Compression testing; Dynamic loads; Dynamics; Fabrication; Maraging steel; Powder metals; Strain rate; Tensile testing; Compression; Digital manufacturing; Impact; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Mechanical design; Mechanical performance; Modified designs; Powder bed; Strain-rates; Honeycomb structures","","","","","European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","This study was conducted at LUT University as a part of the project “Verkostoitumisella voimaa 3D-tulostukseen (VERKOTA, project code: A76589)” funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) .

The specific compression performances and deformation mechanisms of novel gyroid structures made of short carbon fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composite fabricated by fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printing technique are investigated in this study. The effects of the number of unit cells, print direction and relative density on the mechanical properties of 3D printed composite gyroid lattices are studied experimentally and numerically using finite element modelling. The FRP gyroid structures show lower effective elastic modulus when compressively loaded parallel to the FDM print direction due to voids between the 3D printed layers. An empirical formula is proposed to predict the mechanical properties of FRP gyroid lattices as a function of its relative density based on the Gibson-Ashby model. The effect of the slenderness ratio on the compression buckling properties of composite gyroid structures is also studied. A transition from plastic yielding to elastic buckling of the gyroid structures occurs with an increase in the slenderness ratio. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Fibre-reinforced composite;

In this study, Ti basic heterogeneous alloy with Ti-6.5Al-3.5Mo-1.5Zr-0.3Si (TC11) as the main component was deposited using the MWAAM method with the deposition current ranging from 360 A to 400 A. The effects of deposition current on the microstructural evolution, mechanical and corrosion properties of the MWAAM titanium alloys were investigated, and the process-microstructure-property relationship was analyzed. The results show that the microstructure of as-received Ti basic heterogeneous alloy was mainly composed of lamellar primary α phase (αP) and transformed β phase (βT), and increasing the deposition current during the MWAAM process would result in the increased width of α phase and the decreased aspect ratio of α phase. The mechanical properties of MWAAM-deposited specimens decrease with increasing current, which means that phase composition played a dominant role in determining hardness. When increasing the deposition current during the MWAAM process the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) decreased from 843.75 to 804.38 MPa. The MWAAM-deposited Ti basic heterogeneous alloy featured excellent corrosion properties, the corrosion potential of the best specimen was − 311 mV SCE and the corrosion current density was 1.23 × 10−8 Acm−2. This study provides a better understanding of the effect of deposition current on the targeted deposition property in the MWAAM process, which will contribute to future process control, improvement and optimization. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Corrosion performance; Deposition current; Mechanical property; Multi-wire arc additive manufacturing; Ti-6.5Al-3.5Mo-1.5Zr-0.3Si","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Aspect ratio; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant alloys; Corrosive effects; Deposition; Microstructure; Silicon; Silicon alloys; Tensile strength; Titanium alloys; Wire; Additive manufacturing process; Alloy effect; Corrosion performance; Deposition current; Mechanical property and corrosion resistance; Microstructure mechanical properties; Multi-wire arc additive manufacturing; Ti-6.5al-3.5mo-1.5zr-0.3si; Titanium (alloys); Wire arc; 3D printers","","","","","Jiangsu Xuzhou Construction Machinery Research Institute Co.

The Inconel 718 samples were produced by conventional Cast and Wrought (C&W) and by Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) techniques like Selective Laser Melting (SLM). The as-built SLM samples which were subjected to only Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) are labeled as SLM HIP and both Hot Isostatic Pressing and Aeronautic Heat Treatment are labeled as SLM HIP-AHT. The tool life machining tests were performed using PVD coated carbide insert under emulsion conditions. The surface integrity parameters such as surface roughness, residual stresses, and microhardness were evaluated. The wear mechanisms on the rake and flank faces of the PVD insert were characterized. It's deduced that notch and flank wear near the depth of the cutting zone were the predominant failure mode affecting the tool life. The age-hardened microstructural features of C&W and HIP heat-treated SLM samples have a negative impact on the tool life. Whereas the microstructure obtained by the SLM HIP-AHT sample indeed played an important role by exhibiting 26 % more tool life than SLM HIP samples and 79 % more tool life than the C&W sample. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","HIP; HIP-AHT; INCONEL 718; Laser powder based fusion; PVD; SLM; Tool life","Cutting tools; Emulsification; Sintering; Surface roughness; Wear of materials; Cast and wrought; Hot isostatic pressing-AHT; Hot-isostatic pressings; Inconel-718; Laser powder based fusion; Laser powders; Powder-based; Selective laser melting; Tool life; Hot isostatic pressing","","","","","Contrat de Plan Etat - Région Nouvelle-Aquitaine; INSA Euromed; University of Fes; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","Funding text 1: The authors thank, INSA Euromed, University of Fes, Morocco for the fabrication support and Cutting tool research and study center operators (CEROC, France) for machining support.

However, different vertical ionospheric models are applied for single-frequency GNSS users, which need an ionospheric mapping function for conversion. Although many mapping functions can be employed, the influence of latitude, azimuth, solar flux, and other factors are not taken into account. Thus, we proposed a mapping function, named SGG-MF, considering the influence of azimuth. The conversional results of single-layer model mapping function (SLM-MF), Klobuchar mapping function (Klobuchar-MF), modified single layer model mapping function (MSLM-MF) and SGG-MF are evaluated by using coinciding pierce point (CPP) technique as well as single-frequency precise point positioning (SF-PPP) in static mode. For the CPP technique, it is found that the mean absolute errors (MAE) of SLM-MF, Klobuchar-MF, and, MSLM-MF range from 1.5 to 2.1 TECU (total electron content unit), while SGG-MF ranges from 1.5 to 1.7 TECU.

However, fabrication of such TMNCs via advanced additive manufacturing (AM) techniques has rarely been realized due to the presence of AM-induced large columnar grains and the cracking issue associated with the reinforcement coarsening. Here, we report a nanoparticle-mediated approach to in-situ fabricate nano-Ti5Si3 reinforced TMNC coatings by selective laser melting (SLM) of Ti powders and minor amount of SiC nanoparticles. Results showed that with the optimized SiC amount and SLM processing parameters, a crack-free and ultrahigh-strength TMNC consisted of near-equiaxed grain structure and nano-scale Ti5Si3 network at the grain boundaries was successfully produced. The optimized TMNC showed an ultrahigh surface microhardness of 706 VHN, 51.5% higher than that of SLM-fabricated SiC-free sample (466 VHN). Spherical nanoindentation results showed that the effective indentation modulus and indentation yield strength were improved by 62.6% and 57.2%, respectively. A more pronounced strain hardening phenomenon was also observed in the optimized TMNC. The dry sliding tests revealed that the wear rate was reduced by 70%, and the wear mechanism transferred from abrasion to adhesion. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Mechanical performance; Microstructure; Selective laser melting; Ti<sub>5</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>; Titanium matrix nanocomposites","Coarsening; Cracks; Fracture toughness; Grain boundaries; Melting; Nanoparticles; Reinforcement; Selective laser melting; Silicon; Silicon carbide; Strain hardening; Textures; Topography; Wear of materials; Columnar grain; Continuous reinforcement; In-situ synthesis; Manufacturing techniques; Material strength; Mechanical performance; Selective laser melting; Titania matrix; Titania matrix nanocomposite; Tribological properties; Nanocomposites","","","","","Department of Materials Science and Engineering; College of Engineering, Temple University","Y.

In this work, two different reactors were fabricated and compared: a Honeycomb monolith reactor with straight channels and a Periodic Open Cell Structure reactor. The Honeycomb monolith reactor was used as an example of a standard reactor (not necessarily additive manufactured) while the Periodic Open Cell Structure is a promising new type of reactor, which improves some key features, such as contact surface area and porosity. The two reactors were manufactured by Stereolithography technology with a high temperature resin and their internal surfaces were chemically activated by the grafting of palladium. For the surface activation, a two-step procedure was developed, firstly using NaOH and in a second step an aqueous solution of Na2PdCl4. After activation, a heterogeneous catalytic reaction was used to characterize the performance of the two fabricated reactors. The chosen reaction was the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction, which is commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry. The experimental results showed that, for equal contact surface area, the new designed reactor had better performance compared to the standard geometry. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Additives; Catalysis; Chemical activation; Honeycomb structures; Organometallics; Sodium hydroxide; organometallic compound; palladium; resin; sodium hydroxide; Catalytic reactions; Cell structure; Contact surface area; Flow chemistry; Honeycomb monolith; Microstructured reactors; Monolith reactors; Open-cell; Performance; Standard equipments; aqueous solution; Article; catalysis; controlled study; geometry; high temperature; porosity; software; stereolithography; surface area; three dimensional printing; 3D printers","","sodium hydroxide, 1310-73-2","PreForm","","Ministère de l'Enseignement supérieur, de la Recherche et de l'Innovation, MESRI","This work has been done as part of a research project, during a Ph.D. thesis funded by the Ministère de l'Enseignement Supérieur, de la Recherche et de l'Innovation (France).

The morphology and chemistry of the LDH-rGO nanostructures were evaluated by the FE-SEM, EDX, FT-IR, XPS, XRD, Raman, and TGA techniques. Characterization results of SLS@LDH-rGO nanostructures proved the uniform decoration of GO nanosheets with LDH nanolayers and the loading of the SLS inhibitor. The active/barrier corrosion mitigation ability (CMA) of the synthesized nanostructures was studied by EIS and potentiodynamic polarization (PP) tests in both solution (NaCl) and coating (epoxy) phases. Results showed the increment of the total resistance and decrement of the current density of MSSs immersed in the SLS@LDH-rGO extract by 358 and 79%, respectively, compared to the blank solution after 48 h. EIS results proved the bi-functional active-inhibitive/barrier CMA for the SLS@APS-LDH-rGO filled epoxy coatings. The total impedance of the intact SLS@APS-LDH-rGO filled epoxy coating was enhanced by about 9700% after 8 weeks compared to that of the blank coating. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Corrosion mitigation; Epoxy coating; Graphene oxide; Layered double hydroxide; Sodium lignosulfonate","Corrosion prevention; Corrosion resistant coatings; Electrochemical corrosion; Graphene; Nanosheets; Silicon compounds; Sodium; Sodium alloys; Sodium chloride; Aminopropyltriethoxysilane; Corrosion mitigations; Epoxy coatings; Graphene oxide nanosheet; Graphene oxides; Layered-double hydroxides; Nano layers; Sodium lignosulfonates; Synthesised; Zn-Al layered double hydroxides; Epoxy resins","","","","","","","Ahangar M., Izadi M., Shahrabi T., Mohammadi I., The synergistic effect of zinc acetate on the protective behavior of sodium lignosulfonate for corrosion prevention of mild steel in 3.5 wt% NaCl electrolyte: surface and electrochemical studies, J.

There are several magnetic refrigerator device designs in existence today that are predicted to be highly energy-efficient, on condition that suitable working materials can be developed. This challenge in manufacturing magnetocaloric devices is unresolved, mainly due to issues related to shaping the mostly brittle magnetocaloric alloys into thin-walled channeled regenerator structures to facilitate efficient heat transfer between the solid refrigerant and the heat exchange fluid in an active magnetic regenerator (AMR) cooling device. To address this challenge, a novel extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) method has been developed to 3D print microchanneled magnetocaloric structures. The printing ink consists of magnetocaloric powders, a polymer binder, and multiple solvents to achieve desirable shear-thinning property, which is critical for a robust printing process. Acting as a sacrificial binding agent for the magnetic powders, the polymer binder holds the 3D printed structures in place and is removed subsequently using a two-step heat-treatment process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the fabrication process, spatially designed microchannels with minimum dimensions of 150 µm were achieved using nanoscaled La0.6Ca0.4MnO3 powders (diameter~10 nm). Results indicate that the crystallographic properties and magnetofunctional response of the sintered 3D printed samples are comparable to that of the precursor powders. Overall, this study provides a promising route for realizing low-cost magnetic regenerators, thus potentially eliminating one of the main barriers to the commercialization of magnetic cooling technology. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D-printed magnetocaloric regenerators; Active magnetic regenerative (AMR) refrigeration technology; Extrusion-based additive manufacturing","Additives; Calcium compounds; Energy efficiency; Extrusion; IIR filters; Lanthanum compounds; Magnetic refrigeration; Manganese compounds; Phase change materials; Powders; Refrigerants; Regenerators; Shear thinning; 3d-printed magnetocaloric regenerator; Active magnetic regenerative  refrigeration technology; Active magnetic regenerative refrigerations; Cooling technology; Energy efficient; Extrusion-based additive manufacturing; Magnetocaloric; Polymer binders; Polymer-assisted; Refrigeration technology; 3D printers","","","","","Higher Education Equipment Trust; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (1726617); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","Work at VCU was partially funded by Natural Science Foundation ( 1726617 ), Higher Education Equipment Trust Fund HEETF and VCU startup funds.

Moreover, AM parts have a different microstructure than conventionally fabricated parts. In this regard, this article presents a comparative analysis of the effect of microstructure on tool wear during micro-turning of conventionally manufactured and selective laser melting (SLM) or laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) fabricated Ti6Al4V. Primary tool wear mechanisms found are abrasion, adhesion, and built-up edge formation for both the materials. Moreover, edge chipping is found in the case of the LPBF Ti6Al4V attributed to their higher hardness than wrought Ti6Al4V. More tool wear for LPBF Ti6Al4V is primarily caused due to an instability of the β phase at a higher temperature. Alternatively, equiaxed grains of wrought Ti6Al4V show lesser tool wear due to a balanced hardness and yield strength compared to LPBF Ti6Al4V. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Metals and alloys; Micro-turning; Microstructure; Selective laser melting; Ti6Al4V; Tool wear","Hardness; Melting; Metallurgy; Selective laser melting; Ternary alloys; Textures; Titanium alloys; Wear of materials; Comparative analyzes; Fabricated parts; Laser powders; Metals and alloys; Micro-turning; Post-processing; Powder bed; Selective laser melting; Surface imperfections; Tool wear; Aluminum alloys","","","","","","","Gomes M.C., Santos A.G., de Oliveira D., Et al., Int.

It will become an increasingly important platform for in vitro drug development and screening. Most importantly, organ-on-a-chip technology, incorporating 3D cell cultures, overcomes the traditional drawbacks of 2D (flat) cell-culture technology in vitro and in vivo animal trials, neither of which generate completely reliable results when it comes to the actual human subject. It is expected that organ chips will allow huge reductions in the incidence of failure in late-stage human trials, thus slashing the cost of drug development and speeding up the introduction of drugs that are effective. There have been three key enabling technologies that have made organ chip technology possible: 3D bioprinting, fluidic chips, and 3D cell culture, of which the last has allowed cells to be cultivated under more physiologically realistic growth conditions than 2D culture. The fusion of these advanced technologies and the addition of new research methods and algorithms has enabled the construction of chip types with different structures and different uses, providing a wide range of controllable microenvironments, both for research at the cellular level and for more reliable analysis of the action of drugs on the human body. This paper summarizes some research progress of organ-on-a-chip in recent years, outlines the key technologies used and the achievements in drug screening, and makes some suggestions concerning the current challenges and future development of organ-on-a-chip technology. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Bioprinting; Cell culture; Drug screening; Microfluidic chip; Microphysiological system; Organ-on-a-chip","Animals; Bioprinting; Biosensing Techniques; Cell Culture Techniques; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Humans; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices; Cell culture; Controlled drug delivery; Microfluidics; Physiology; 3-D cell culture; Bioprinting; Chip technology; Drug development; Drug-screening; In-vitro; Microenvironments; Microfluidic-chips; Microphysiological system; Organ-on-a-chip; algorithm; Article; bioprinting; biotechnology; cell function; cell growth; clinical trial (topic); drug efficacy; drug metabolism; drug screening; drug toxicity; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; medical research; membrane structure; nonhuman; reliability; simulation; three dimensional bioprinting; three dimensional cell culture; toxicology; two dimensional cell culture; animal; bioprinting; cell culture technique; genetic procedures; lab on a chip; preclinical study; procedures; Microfluidic chips","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62122017); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","The authors thank the financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 62122017 ).","Abaci H.E., Shuler M.L., Human-on-a-chip design strategies and principles for physiologically based pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics modeling, Integr.

Additive manufacturing methods utilized by the industry are generally based on polylactic acid (PLA) or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) materials using the fused deposition modelling (FDM) method. However, in present commercial applications, besides extensive use of PLA/ABS, their low strength has emerged as their biggest disadvantage. However, polyetherimide (PEI)/ULTEM 1010 parts represent high-performance engineering thermoplastics and offer superior mechanical properties with high thermal stability. On the other hand, selection of an appropriate raster angle orientation for single- and multi-oriented layers is also of considerable interest. A comprehensive study has been conducted herein on the building of a part using the FDM method using PEI/ULTEM 1010, and attempts have been made to identify the effects of raster angle in single- (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°) and multi-oriented (0/90°, 30°/-60°, 45°/-45°, 0°/90°/45°/-45°) layers. PEI specimens were manufactured via 3D printer, and the mechanical behaviour (tensile, bending and hardness) of the printed parts was correlated with their structures. Morphological properties of tensile fracture surface of 3D printed samples were analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Analysis indicated that a 0° part deposition orientation offers optimal mechanical properties because of the bonding structure.  © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","additive manufacturing; fused deposition modelling; oriented layers; polyetherimide; raster angle","Additives; Deposition; Fused Deposition Modeling; Styrene; Thermal Engineering; Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene; Commercial applications; Engineering thermoplastics; Manufacturing methods; Material's type; Model method; Oriented layer; Part deposition orientations; Performance engineering; Raster angle; Scanning electron microscopy","","","","","Scientific Research Projects Unit; Gaziantep Üniversitesi, (RM.16.01)","Research funding: This work was supported by the Scientific Research Projects Unit (BAPYB) of Gaziantep University (Project numbers: RM.16.01).

Recently, many studies related to cultured meat have been conducted, but producing large-sized cultured meat remains a challenge. It is aimed to introduce 3D bioprinting for producing large cell aggregates for cultured meat production. A hydrogel scaffold is produced at the centimeter scale using a bioink consisting of photocrosslinkable materials for digital light processing-based (DLP) printing, which has high printing accuracy and can produce geometrically complex structures. The light exposure time for hydrogel photopolymerization by DLP bioprinting is optimized based on photorheometry and cell viability assays. Naturally immortalized bovine embryonic fibroblast cells transformed with MyoD and PPARγ2 instead of primary cells are used as the latter have difficulties in maintaining stemness and are associated with animal ethics issues. The cells are mixed into the hydrogel for printing. Myogenesis and adipogenesis are induced simply by changing the medium after printing. Scaffolds are obtained successfully with living cells and large microchannels. The cooked cultured meat maintains its size and shape upon cutting. The overall dimensions are 3.43 cm × 5.53 cm × 0.96 cm. This study provides proof-of-concept for producing 3D cultured meat using bioinks. © 2022 The Authors.

Microstructural evolution observations reveal that the remelted heterogeneous layer consists of gradient refined equiaxed α-Mg grains (average grain size from ∼4.6 μm in the bottom to ∼ 60 nm at the surface) and dispersed block-shaped nanoscaled β-Mg17Al12 precipitations (∼22.8 nm), which is obviously different from the favored coarse dendritic or cellular α-Mg grains and lamellar β precipitations during conventional laser processing. The formation of this remelted layer is attributed to constitutional supercooling caused by solute elements and the thermal undercooling generated by the high cooling rates based on optimized processing parameters and liquid nitrogen cooling. The heterogeneous nanostructured remelted layer makes the laser-treated sample has a high hardness of 1.51 GPa, a yield strength of 230.4 MPa and an ultimate tensile strength of 313.7 MPa with a good ductility (12.5%). The laser-treated samples also show the higher fatigue lifetimes in low-cycle as well as high-cycle fatigue tests, which are respectively 2.3 and 18.6 times higher than the original samples. In addition, the laser-treated specimen exhibits a 25% higher fatigue limit compared with the original sample. The synergistic strengthening mechanism including gradient grain refinement and dispersed nanoscaled precipitations are quantitatively discussed to improve strength-ductility synergy and strain hardening capacity in the laser-treated samples. This mechanism could effectively facilitate resisting the initiation and propagation of the fatigue microcracks, which was further validated by the in-situ transmission electron microscope observations. Our results in this study could be further applied for the modification of grain morphology and precipitation distribution for additive manufacturing applications, critical to the development of advanced structural Mg alloys with high service performance in practical engineering environments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Fatigue resistance; Heterogeneous microstructure; In-situ TEM; Laser surface remelting; Mg alloy","Cooling; Ductile fracture; Ductility; Etching; Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; Magnesium alloys; Microcracks; Microstructural evolution; Morphology; Precipitation (chemical); Strain hardening; Tensile strength; Textures; Transmission electron microscopy; Fatigue-resistance; Heterogeneous microstructure; In-situ TEM; Laser surface remelting; Laser treated; Mg alloy; Nanoscaled; Original sample; Remelted layers; Strength-ductility synergies; Fatigue of materials","","","","","Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU, (G-YW5N); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, (JCYJ20210324131405015)","This work was supported by Fundamental research program of The Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission (No. JCYJ20210324131405015 ) and PolyU Postdoctoral Fellowships Scheme (No. G-YW5N ).

However, the obtainable mechanical performance is significantly limited by the monotonous strut-based feature without any reinforcement topology. The inherent strengthening mechanisms and atom-scale models in material science may be crucial and valuable to optimize the complex structures with desired properties. Inspired by the solid solution strengthening mechanisms in crystal microstructure, a series of novel crystal-inspired hybrid structures, i.e., the common face-center cubic with Z-strut (FCCZ) structure, the face-center substitutional lattice (FCSL) structure, the edge-center interstitial lattice (ECIL) structure and the vertex-node substitutional lattice (VNSL) structure were designed and fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing in this work. The effect of node location on the LPBF formability, mechanical performance, stress distribution, deformation modes and failure mechanisms of the crystal-inspired components was systematically investigated. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method was used to understand the dynamics of molten pool to reveal the formation mechanism and control methods of the dross defect attached to overhanging surfaces. Finite element model (FEM) was established to show the stress distribution and deformation behavior of these hybrid structures during compression. Results showed that the ECIL structure possessed the highest specific energy absorption (SEA) of 13.7 J/g, which increased by 17% compared with the initial FCCZ structure. The crush force efficiency (CFE) of VNSL structure reached the peak value of 66% with a unique axisymmetric shear band during deformation, which increased by 14% compared to the FCCZ structure. The underlying mechanism analysis revealed that the as-designed spherical node could redistribute the stress and the performance of the lattice structures could be manipulated by tailoring the position of the spherical nodes. The present approach suggested that the hardening principles of crystalline materials could inspire the design of novel lattice structures with desired properties. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Crystal-inspired structure; Hybrid lattice structure; Laser powder bed fusion; Mechanical property; Structural feature sensitivity","Computational fluid dynamics; Energy absorption; Failure (mechanical); Mechanisms; Microstructure; Reinforcement; Stress concentration; Structural properties; Struts; Crystal-inspired structure; Feature sensitivity; Hybrid lattice; Hybrid lattice structure; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Lattice structures; Powder bed; Structural feature; Structural feature sensitivity; Deformation","","","","","LPBF, (24–26, 33–35); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51735005, 51921003); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Guangxi Key Research and Development Program, (BE2022069, BE2022069-1); Guangxi Key Research and Development Program","Funding text 1: On the other hand, LPBF fabricated lattice structures often departs from their as-designed counterparts due to the inherent geometric imperfections induced by LPBF [ 24–26]. Furthermore, considering the significant differences of laser absorptivity and heat conductivity between solid material and powder, severe heat accumulation is concentrated at powder-support zone, leading to a relatively large molten pool dimension compared to that of the solid-support part. Based on these considerations, the main defects such as stair stepping, balling phenomenon, bonded powder, dross formation often exist in the overhanging surface [ 27–29]. The evolution and formation mechanism of geometric imperfections play a pivotal role on LPBF formability and surface quality. The multiphase flow models and heat transfer of the molten pool during LPBF were studied for AlSi10Mg [30,31] and steel [32], which have been widely used and investigated for both solid parts and lattice structures. Recently, the mechanical properties and microstructure of high strength Al–Mg-Sc-Zr alloy processed by LPBF have been studied [ 33–35]. The processing parameters and the microstructure-mechanical properties relationship of this alloy were discussed in details, indicating that Al–Mg-Sc-Zr exhibited remarkable potential for structural material because of its great strength-ductility synergy. In addition, the near net shape capability of laser additive manufacturing enables the buy-to-fly ratio close to 1, making it an alternative production route for complex structural components with expensive materials [36]. While these studies mainly focused on the solid parts and Al–Mg-Sc-Zr alloy was rarely applied for lattice structures, which exhibited higher sensitivity of structural dimensions and defects during LPBF process. The underlying fluid transfer of the molten pool and the dross formation mechanism for Al–Mg-Sc-Zr lattice structures under suspension conditions should also be discussed in details.This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51735005), the Key Research and Development Program of Jiangsu (No. BE2022069, No. BE2022069-1) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China for Creative Research Groups (No.51921003).; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51735005 ), the Key Research and Development Program of Jiangsu (No. BE2022069 , No. BE2022069-1 ) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China for Creative Research Groups (No. 51921003 ).","Maconachie T., Leary M., Lozanovski B., Zhang X., Qian M., Faruque O., Brandt M., SLM lattice structures: properties, performance, applications and challenges, Mater.

The forward Euler (explicit) time integration strategy is thoroughly benchmarked for the first time in a Powder Bed Fusion simulation. We also compare the computational times of explicit and implicit schemes when applied to an experimentally validated Powder Bed Fusion simulation. We demonstrate that the use of the former scheme results in considerable speedups (20 to 100) without noticeable loss of accuracy. We furthermore propose a Powder Bed Fusion-dedicated procedure to estimate the maximum allowable time step size of the explicit scheme. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Electron beam melting; Explicit scheme; Finite elements; Forward Euler; Laser beam melting; Mesocale powder bed fusion modelling; Selective laser melting","Electron beams; Laser beams; Melting; Selective laser melting; Electron-beam melting; Explicit scheme; Finite element; Forward euler; Fusion model; Laser beam melting; Mesocale; Mesocale powder bed fusion modeling; Powder bed; Selective laser melting; Finite element method","","","","","Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR, (ANR-17-CE10-0004)","This work was supported by the ANR GeoCAM, grant ANR-17-CE10-0004 of the French National Research Agency (ANR) .","Gibson I., Rosen D., Stucker B., Khorasani M., Additive Manufacturing Technologies, (2021); Teng C., Pal D., Gong H., Zeng K., Briggs K., Patil N., Stucker B., A review of defect modeling in laser material processing, Addit.

The correlation of grain orientation, size and aspect ratio on mechanical properties were investigated using in-situ EBSD tensile method on selective laser melting Al–Mn-Sc alloys in longitudinal section and cross section. The lattice rotation behavior and the effects of grain orientation, grain size and aspect ratio on mechanical anisotropy were explored. The predominant <001> orientation of the columnar crystals in the longitudinal section and the <102 > and <101> orientation that dominates the equiaxed crystals in the cross-section had a certain influence on the anisotropy of mechanical properties. The grains with different shapes and sizes exhibited different rotation behavior, and lattice rotation of equiaxed crystals with smaller grain sizes was more complex. By introducing anisotropy coefficients (Ka), the anisotropy sensitivity to grain orientations was revealed. Based on the anisotropy coefficient, grain size and aspect ratio, the mechanical anisotropy in both directions was accurately predicted. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Al–Mn-Sc alloys; In-situ EBSD tensile; Mechanical anisotropy","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Anisotropy; Aspect ratio; Binary alloys; Crystal lattices; Crystal orientation; Grain size and shape; Melting; Scandium alloys; Selective laser melting; Tensile testing; Textures; Al–mn-sc alloy; Anisotropy of mechanical properties; Aspect-ratio; Grain orientation; Grainsize; In-situ EBSD tensile; Lattice rotations; Longitudinal section; Mechanical anisotropy; Size ratio; Manganese alloys","","","","","National Building Project of Application Demonstration Platform on New Materials Products, (TC190H3ZV/2)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the National Building Project of Application Demonstration Platform on New Materials Products (Project No. TC190H3ZV/2 ) for their supportive effect in finance.","DebRoy T., Wei H.L., Zuback J.S., Mukherjee T., Elmer J.W., Milewski J.O., Beese A.M., Wilson-Heid A., De A., Zhang W., Additive manufacturing of metallic components – process, structure and properties, Prog.

The influences of laser energy density (Ev) on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the as-built H13 were studied. The results show that the relative density (RD) increases with the increasing Ev, and nearly full dense samples (RD > 99.5%) can be obtained with Ev above 40 J/mm3. The microstructure of the as-built H13 consists of prior austenite grains (PAGs), lath martensite and residual austenite. With the increase of Ev, microstructural features including the average width of PAGs, the average grain size of lath martensite, the content of residual austenite and the fraction of the high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBS) remain basically unchanged, whereas the dislocation density increases. Several V-rich and Cr-rich precipitates with diameters of 10–40 nm formed in the matrix as the result of the in-situ tempering effect during the HP-LPBF process. The in-situ tempering effect is stronger at higher Ev. As the Ev increases from 47.6 J/mm3 to 100 J/mm3, the build rate and elongation (El) of the as-built H13 decrease, whereas the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and yield strength tensile (YS) improve continuously. The sample built at 100 J/mm3 achieves excellent YS (1540 ± 25 MPa) and good UTS (1920 ± 30 MPa) and El (3.1 ± 0.6%) in comparison with the H13 fabricated by the conventional LPBF using low-power laser (500 W). Meanwhile, the build rate (40 mm3/s) is about 8–40 times higher than that of the conventional LPBF. The excellent mechanical property of the HP-LPBF H13 is mainly attributed to dislocation strengthening and precipitation strengthening, followed by grain boundary strengthening. The present study provides a potential way to realize the additive manufacturing of high strength H13 tool steel products with a high build rate. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Build rate; H13 tool steel; High power laser powder bed fusion (HP-LPBF); Microstructure and mechanical property","Additives; Austenite; Fabrication; Martensite; Microstructure; Strengthening (metal); Tempering; Tensile strength; Tool steel; Tools; Build rate; H13 tool steel; High power laser powder bed fusion; High-power lasers; Laser powders; Lath martensite; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Powder bed; Prior austenite grains; Relative density; Grain boundaries","","","","","Huazhong University of Science and Technology, HUST, (2021XXJS029); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFB1103800); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Major Science and Technology Projects of China, (Y2019-VII-0011-0151)","This work was supported by the National Science and Technology Major Project (Grant No. Y2019-VII-0011-0151 ), the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFB1103800 ), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities , HUST (Grant No. 2021XXJS029 ).

The high temperature gradient near the laser spot generates high residual stress that can lead to failure of fabricated parts. Estimation of the residual stress for real transient SLM processes by simulation involves considerable computation effort which makes its application in real industrial SLM processes rather difficult. To tackle this challenge, a two-stage coupled transient thermomechanical model with a quasi-transient heat source was developed. In the first stage, a transient thermal analysis was performed to acquire temperature distribution of the full SLM process. The temperature distribution serves as thermal loading input for subsequent transient thermal stress analysis. This quasi-transient thermomechanical model can provide residual stress data consistent with that of a conventional full transient model in 68% less computation time. The data provided by the new model also includes the dynamic stress release due to re-heating and re-melting in overlapped laser scanned regions which was in close confirmation with experimental results. This efficient quasi-transient model is useful for rapid analysis and optimization of SLM processing parameters. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Powder bed fusion; Quasi-transient thermomechanical analysis; Residual stress; Selective laser melting; Stress release; Thermal stress","High power lasers; Melting; Selective laser melting; Stress analysis; Temperature distribution; Thermal stress; Thermoanalysis; Transient analysis; Laser melting process; Modeling of dynamics; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion; Quasi-transient thermomechanical analyse; Selective laser melting; Stress release; Thermo-mechanical analysis; Thermomechanical modelling; Transient model; Residual stresses","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (MOST-110–2218-E-007–053, MOST-110–2221-E-007–004-MY2, MOST-110–2221-E-007–049, MOST-110–3116-F-027–001)","Authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from MOST ( Ministry of Science and Technology ) in Taiwan (Grant No: MOST-110–2218-E-007–053 , MOST-110–2221-E-007–049 , MOST-110–2221-E-007–004-MY2 , MOST-110–3116-F-027–001 ).

Fast-computed numerical solvers are critical in implementing the digital twin framework in the additive manufacturing process addressing one of its main open problems: lack of quality assurance. The first surrogate model is the reduced Gaussian process emulator. It is a data-driven model equipped with a nonlinear dimension reduction scheme and manages to predict temperature profiles almost instantly (around 0.036s on average) with an accuracy of 95% for 99.38% of tests. Another surrogate model is the sketched emulator with local projection. It projects the accurate but high-dimensional finite element method solution on a low-dimensional basis and then bypasses the majority of costly computations for the temperature-dependent matrices in the projected model by randomized sketching. It has higher accuracy (97.78% of tests with relative errors below 1%) while spending comparably more time online (around 42.23s on average). Although compared with the finite element model both surrogates promote time efficiency with some minor controlled compromise in accuracy, the reduced Gaussian process emulator enables real-time implementation while the sketched emulator with local projection offers comparably higher levels of accuracy. A series of numerical experiments are carried out, which assumes a three-layer printing process with a fixed laser beam trajectory using a small number of printing control parameters as inputs, namely the laser power, scan speed, and time coordinates. Both surrogates are also principally feasible in other thermal-driven additive manufacturing to obtain better quality assurance with techniques like uncertainty management and closed-loop control. © 2022 The Author(s)","Finite element method; Gaussian process emulator; Model order reduction; Randomized sketching; Transient thermal model","3D printers; Additives; Finite element method; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Laser beams; Nonlinear equations; Process control; Real time control; Gaussian process emulators; Laser powders; Local projections; Model order reduction; Powder bed; Randomized sketching; Sketchings; Surrogate modeling; Time-efficient; Transient thermal models; Quality assurance","","","","","University of Edinburgh, ED","We are grateful to the Principal’s Career Development and Edinburgh Global Research Scholarship from the School of Engineering at the University of Edinburgh, UK for sponsoring this research.

This paper explores the underwater operation potential of an emerging solid-state additive technology: additive friction stir deposition, wherein material feeding and bonding are enabled by mechanical forces with minimal influences from water. It is demonstrated that additive friction stir deposition of 304 stainless steel can be successfully performed with the print head and substrate immersed in water. High temperature is reached in the deposition zone (>60% melting temperature); the material deposition behavior is similar to that in typical open-air operation. The as-deposited material is fully-dense, having fewer annealing twins and a substantially smaller grain size than the feed material (4.98 μm vs. 31.44 μm). Such microstructural changes stem from dynamic recrystallization caused by the large strain and high temperature introduced during deposition. In addition to grain refinement, small equiaxed dispersoids (∼2–3 μm or less) are formed and evenly distributed in the austenite steel matrix. Rich in Cr, Mn, and O, these particles likely result from the reaction between the elements in stainless steel and water at elevated temperatures. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive friction stir deposition; Dynamic recrystallization; Oxide formation; Solid-state additive manufacturing; Stainless steel; Underwater","3D printers; Deposition; Dynamic recrystallization; Friction; Friction stir welding; Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; Textures; Additive friction stir deposition; Dynamic recrystallisation; Feed materials; Friction stir; Highest temperature; Material supply; Materials quality; Oxide formation; Solid-state additive manufacturing; Underwater; Additives","","","","","Virginia Tech National Center for Earth and Environmental Nanotechnology Infrastructure; National Science Foundation, NSF, (DE-AC52-07NA27344, ECCS 1542100, ECCS 2025151); Naval Sea Systems Command, NAVSEA","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank Dr. Mackenzie Perry from NAVSEA as well as Hannah Glaser, Jake Yoder, and Ryan Gottwald from Virginia Tech for helpful discussions.

To obtain a new lightweight multifunctional structure with novel structure and excellent performance, and promote the deep combination of additive manufacturing and optimization design, ZrO2(3Y)/Al2O3 hollow lattice structure ceramics with two kinds of high precision and different porosity were prepared by vat photopolymerization in this paper, and the process optimization, microstructure evolution, and performance were studied. The hollow lattice structure with good molding accuracy and porosity of 35 %–55 % was prepared by component design, optimization of slurry, degreasing, and sintering process, which effectively avoided the ceramic cracking and collapse caused by resin volatilization. When the Al2O3 content was 6 wt%, dense ZrO2(3Y)/Al2O3 ceramics with grain refinement, excellent microhardness, and fracture toughness were obtained. The relationship between lattice structure and compressive strength was analyzed by simulation and compressive test. The results show that the compressive strength of the two hollow lattice structures decreases with the increase of porosity. The maximum compressive strength of 35 %-face-centered cubic (FCC) hollow lattice structure is 326 MPa, which is significantly higher than that of body-centered cubic (BCC) structure (240 MPa) with the same porosity. The hollow lattice ceramic structure with good comprehensive performance and lightweight will lay a foundation for the application of industrial heat insulation, high temperature catalysis, and purification carrier in the future. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","3D printing; Analogue simulation; Lattice structure; Mechanical properties; ZrO<sub>2</sub>(3Y)/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ceramics","3D printers; Aluminum oxide; Compressive strength; Crystal structure; Fracture toughness; Grain refinement; Laser heating; Microstructure; Optimization; Process control; Sintering; Zirconia; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Analog simulations; Ceramic component; Lattice structures; Microstructure evolutions; Photo polymerization; Printing technologies; Process optimisation; ZrO2(3y)/al2O3 ceramic; Porosity","","","","","Beijing Municipal Commission of Education; Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission, BMSTC, (KM202010005003); Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission, BMSTC","This research was sponsored by the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission Project ( KM202010005003 ) and General Program of Science and Technology Development Project of Beijing Municipal Education Commission .

Specifically, we consider the Rosenthal solution for a moving point heat source in steady state on a semi-infinite solid. Firstly, we analyze the feasibility of the thermal problem while constraining the melt pool size and aspect ratio. We then express the maximum allowable velocity and the corresponding power as explicit functions of the constraints and material properties. Finally, we examine a wide range of melting processes within a dimensionless framework derived from the above solution. The paper concludes with an application example concerning lack of fusion porosity in powder bed fusion additive manufacturing, which shows the reliability of analytical estimates despite the complexity of the underlying physics. This makes it possible to outline a direct procedure for optimizing the main process parameters given a few basic requirements. Ultimately, the proposed methods are not intended to replace other modeling and experimental approaches, but rather to complement their capabilities and encourage more efficient use of available resources. In addition, reframing seemingly different problems within a common perspective can improve understanding, reveal new levels of similarity, and sometimes even allow for global solutions. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Porosity; Process optimization; Rosenthal solution; Welding","Additives; Aspect ratio; Melting; Optimization; Selective laser melting; Melting process; Moving heat sources; Optimisations; Point heat source; Process optimisation; Rosenthal solution; Semi-infinite solids; Steady state; Theoretical framework; Welding; Porosity","","","","","Università degli Studi di Padova, UNIPD","The authors express their gratitude to Franco Bonollo and Paolo Ferro from the University of Padova, who provided insight and expertise in the interpretation of the reviewed literature on aluminium alloys.","Mendez P.F., Lu Y., Wang Y., Scaling analysis of a moving point heat source in steady-state on a semi-infinite solid, J.

The latest research on the PBF-EB technique reveals the possibility of establishing different microstructures and differing mechanical properties inside a component made of titanium aluminides (TiAl). In detail, two different well-adjusted process parameter sets lead to varying melt pool characteristics and a significant change in localized aluminum (Al) loss during melting. After heat treatment, the as-built microstructure containing two different levels of Al is transformed into differing customized microstructure and properties. Areas with high Al concentration will be transformed into a nearly lamellar microstructure (NL+γ) with enhanced strength. In contrast, areas with lowered Al concentration will be changed into a fully lamellar microstructure (FL) that displays an increased creep resistance. The presented dual microstructure concept, based on the functionally graded material (FGM) concept, is a groundbreaking benefit from the PBF-EB process necessary to overcome prevailing design limitations. For the first time, components such as TiAl turbine blades can consist of creep-resistant airfoil sections and high strength root sections taking advantage of new design possibilities and additional weight savings at robust dual microstructure designs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Aluminum evaporation; Electron beam powder bed fusion; functional graded material with dual microstructure; Titanium Aluminides","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Beams and girders; Binary alloys; Creep; Creep resistance; Electron beams; Functionally graded materials; High temperature applications; Microstructure; Titanium alloys; Aluminium concentration; Aluminum evaporation; Electron beam powder bed fusion; Electron-beam; Functional graded material with dual microstructure; Functional graded materials; Lamellar microstructure; Powder bed; Titanium aluminides; Titanium-aluminides; Aluminum","","","","","","","Kim Y.-W., Gamma Titanium Aluminide Alloys, (2014); Schloffer M., Gefüge und Eigenschaften der intermetallischen TNM-Legierung, Dissertation, Leoben, (2013); Mayer S., Et al., Intermetallic β-solidifying γ-TiAl based alloys − from fundamental research to application, Adv.

The electrical properties, strain sensing property and electro-induced shape memory effect of flexible TPAE/MWCNTs nanocomposites are fully investigated. The conductivity of TPAE/MWCNTs nanocomposites increases as the MWCNTs content increases owing to the interconnected MWCNTs conductive network. During compressing test with different deformation strain and speed, the SLS-processed flexible sensor exhibits a regular, fast, sensitive and stable cyclic response which shows its great potential for artificial electronic skin, human-machine interface and health monitoring. The TPAE-5.0C nanocomposite also possessed an excellent shape recovery ability during electro-induced shape memory cycle which was triggered by Joule heat under DC voltage. The MWCNTs-TPAE powder prepared here provides a novel material for SLS 3D-printing and the SLS-processed devices with outstanding performance and multiple functions will be very useful for developing flexible and lightweight wearables in the future. © 2022","Electro-induced shape memory; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs); Selective laser sintering (SLS); Strain sensor; Thermoplastic polyether-block-amide elastomer (TPAE)","","","","","","Key Research and Development and Promotion Projects of Henan Province; SLS-processing; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (20220609, 51703206, 51973201, U1804128); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFB0307600); Major Science and Technology Project of Hainan Province, (181100211200)","Funding text 1: 3D printing is an innovative and fast manufacturing technology, which can turn complex 3D models into real objects through layer-by-layer curing of powdered, liquid or linear materials [1]. Selective laser sintering (SLS) is one of the most mature 3D printing techniques which ensures the higher three-dimensional freedom and accuracy and has been widely applied in different fields, including electronics [2], aerospace [3], automobile [4] and biomedical engineering [5]. After the establishment of CAD model, layout, slicing and pushing powder during the SLS process, the solid powder is selectively sintered into a molten layer via a computer-controlled laser and then the fused layers solidified into the desired shape in a layer-by-layer approach. In contrast with some other additive manufacturing processes, such as stereolithography (SLA) and fused deposition modeling (FDM), which most often require special support structures to fabricate overhanging designs [6], SLS printers do not require auxiliary scaffold structural support during printing because the un-sintered powders can be used as the support for the printed part. As a result, SLS processing speed is usually faster than SLA and FDM [7]. Besides, the higher density products [8,9] and higher productivity can be also achieved by SLS-processing and the technology is suitable for polymers (e.g. nylon with or without fillers, polystyrene), metals (e.g. steel, titanium, alloy mixtures), ceramic (e.g. alumina, zirconia), and so on.Financial support from NSFC (51703206, U1804128, 51973201), the Open Fund for Key Lab of Guangdong High Property and Functional Macromolecular Materials, China (20220609), the Key Research and Development and Promotion Projects of Henan Province in 2020 (Scientific and Technological Research Program, to Peng Fu), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFB0307600), Major science and technology projects of Henan Province (181100211200) is gratefully acknowledged.; Funding text 2: Financial support from NSFC ( 51703206 , U1804128 , 51973201 ), the Open Fund for Key Lab of Guangdong High Property and Functional Macromolecular Materials , China ( 20220609 ), the Key Research and Development and Promotion Projects of Henan Province in 2020 (Scientific and Technological Research Program, to Peng Fu), the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2017YFB0307600 ), Major science and technology projects of Henan Province ( 181100211200 ) is gratefully acknowledged.

Numerical finite element simulations and uniaxial compression tests are carried out to characterise the mechanical structure properties. The deformation of the structure is analysed using the traditional digital image correlation (DIC) method and a new approach based X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning analysis. The effect of material and design parameters of the proposed structure on the Poisson's ratio is investigated to identify the design variables to tune the auxetic behaviour of the structure. The results show that the designed structure exhibits a marked auxetic behaviour with, at the lowest, a Poisson's ratio of about −6. © 2022","AlSi10Mg; Auxetic structure; Electron beam powder bed fusion; Finite element; Laser powder bed fusion; Ti6Al4V","3D printers; Additives; Compression testing; Computerized tomography; Finite element method; Geometry; Image correlation; Poisson ratio; Powder metals; Titanium alloys; Auxetic behavior; Auxetic structures; Electron beam powder bed fusion; Electron-beam; Finite element; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Metal additives; Powder bed; Aluminum alloys","","","","","","","Evans K.E., Nkansah M.A., Hutchinson I.J., Rogers S.C., Molecular network design [7], Nature, 353, (1991); Carneiro V.H., Meireles J., Puga H., Auxetic materials - a review, Mater.

The study has a double interest, that is, the possibility of printing a 3D piece that contains the codified information and the development of a system for its decoding. For this purpose, magnetic nanoparticles (magnetite Fe3O4) were embedded in a polymeric matrix of Polylactic Acid (PLA) and Poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL). Similar to a conventional barcode, a rectangular piece with an alternating pattern of strips with absence (only polymer) and a 5 wt% of embedded magnetic nanoparticles was 3D printed employing the Fused Deposition Modelling technique (FDM). The information was decoded by means of a Giant Magnetoimpedance (GMI) sensor-based prototype, by scanning the surface of the piece and measuring the changes in the magnetic field. As sensor nucleus, an amorphous soft magnetic wire of nominal composition (Co0.94 Fe0.06)72.5 Si12.5 B15 was employed. The decoding prototype incorporates a homemade electronic sensor interface that permits, at the time, the GMI sensor excitation and the subsequent signal conditioning to optimize its response. The output signal enables the detection of the magnetite nanoparticles and the magnetic decoding of the encoded information (“1” and “0”, presence or absence of the magnetic nanoparticles, respectively). © 2022 The Authors","3D printing; Binary encoding information; Electronic sensor interface; GMI effect; Magnetic sensor; Polymer-matrix composites","3D printers; Decoding; Encoding (symbols); Magnetite; Magnetite nanoparticles; Signal encoding; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Binary encoding information; Binary encodings; Electronic sensor interface; Encoding informations; Giant magneto impedance effect; Giant magneto-impedance; Magneto-impedance sensors; Printing technologies; Polymer matrix composites","","","","","Departamento de Desarrollo Económico; Spanish Government; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033, PID2019–107258RB-C32); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN; Universidad Pública de Navarra, UPNA","Funding text 1: This work has been funded by the Gobierno de Navarra - Departamento de Desarrollo Económico within the framework of the Project: “Advanced Manufacturing of Electronics, AMELEC”.

However, the very high preheating temperature in the printing process, shrinkage and warpage of parts, poor reusability of powder limited the industry opportunities. Concurrently, carbon fiber (CF) was added in the PEEK powder to prepare higher strength composites, and yet the processability of the powder was seldom discussed, which was very crucial for the industry application. In this paper, the processability of CF/PEEK mixture powder was focused. The results showed the preheating efficiency of mixture powder was highly enhanced, and the preheating temperature could be lower (305 °C) than pure PEEK (>320 °C), which decreased the process difficulty. Meanwhile, the sintered CF/PEEK composite parts had much smaller shrinkage and warpage, thereby improving the accuracy of the parts significantly. Beyond that, the CF/PEEK mixture showed a better reusability compared with PEEK. For the CF/PEEK mixture, the strength of composite built with the fourth recycled powder showed a slight decrease comparing with the virgin powder. While, the strength of pure PEEK part built with the second recycled powder began declining sharply. Therefore, the enhanced processability and better reusability of CF/PEEK mixture powder manifested the significant potentiality in the industry. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon fiber reinforced PEEK composites; Powder bed fusion; Processability; Reusability","","","","","","National High-tech Research and Development Program, (2015AA042503)","Funding text 1: The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests; Xiaoyong Tian reports financial support was provided by the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program) . ; Funding text 2: This work is supported by the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program) , Grant No. 2015AA042503 .","Yan S., Et al., Hydrogen ion induced ultralow wear of PEEK under extreme load, Appl.

Though electron beam powder bed fusion (E-PBF) can produce components with minimal defects and residual stresses compared to laser powder bed fusion and directed energy deposition, variations of them may occur within the complex geometry of a component, due to inherent variations of thermal signatures and the evolution of section modulus along the build direction. This work reveals the residual stress distribution, characterised from neutron diffraction, of an as-fabricated Haynes 282 monolith containing internal cube voids and thin wall struts of varying thicknesses. Complementary local hardness measurements and multi-scale microscopy were used to investigate the geometry-structure-property relationships. Observed variations in hardness were attributed to a combination of type I macro-scale residual stresses and variations in bimodal γ′ precipitation behaviour. The results highlight the influence of residual stresses and microstructure on the mechanical properties of E-PBF Haynes 282. © 2022 The Authors","Electron beam powder bed fusion; Hardness; Neutron diffraction; Residual stress; Superalloy","3D printers; Additives; Electron beams; Hardness; Neutron diffraction; Nickel alloys; Struts; Superalloys; Thin walled structures; Distribution of residual stress; Electron beam powder bed fusion; Electron-beam; Fabricated parts; Mechanical performance; Minimal defect; Ni-based superalloys; Powder bed; Thin walls; Varying thickness; Residual stresses","","","","","Los Alamos Neutron Science Center; Research Office of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, (P0039581, P0039966); National Science Foundation, NSF, (2019260337); National Science Foundation, NSF; Office of Naval Research, ONR, (N00014-18-1-2794); Office of Naval Research, ONR; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (89233218CNA000001); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Advanced Manufacturing Office, AMO, (DE-AC05-00OR22725); Advanced Manufacturing Office, AMO; Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE; National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL; Los Alamos National Laboratory, LANL; U.S. Navy, USN; University of New South Wales, UNSW; University of Sydney, Usyd; Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, Australian Government","Funding text 1: This research was sponsored by the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science under the auspices of the AUSMURI program which is a part of the Commonwealth’s Next Generation Technologies Fund.

Nowadays the most widely used materials are polyamides (PA12, PA11…) but massively available LPBF-compatible polyolefin powders recently arrived on the market. The need of understanding the crystallization process for these new materials is essential and this was addressed in the present work. Isothermal and non-isothermal crystallization kinetics was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and parts microstructure was analyzed using polarized light optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and wide-angle X-rays diffraction experiments. It was shown that it is important to consider the significant nucleating effect of the sub-surface layers solidification during the building stage. Indeed, half-crystallization times of the PP material are consistent with experimental observations and time range in LPBF only if crystallization occurs from a self-nucleated molten state. Evidence of the presence of nuclei were given thanks to microscopic and wide-angle X-rays diffraction (WAXD) techniques. Alternate patterns of very finely microstructured, oriented transcrystalline regions and isotropic spherulitic regions every 100 µm (i.e. the layer thickness during printing) were highlighted. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Crystallization; Laser powder bed fusion; Microstructure; Polypropylene","3D printers; Additives; Crystallization kinetics; Differential scanning calorimetry; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Isotherms; Polypropylenes; Scanning electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; Crystallization process; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Manufacturing techniques; Nonisothermal crystallization kinetics; Polarized light optical microscopies; Powder bed; Thermoplastic polymer; Wide angle; X- ray diffractions; Microstructure","","","","","Association Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie, ANRT, (2019/0577)","The authors gratefully acknowledge SETUP PERFORMANCE SAS and ANRT for funding the PhD Thesis of Thomas Maulet (CIFRE N° 2019/0577 ).","Jasiuk I., Abueidda D.W., Kozuch C., Pang S., Su F.Y., McKittrick J., An overview on additive manufacturing of polymers, Addit.

Owing to the great differences between these two alloy systems, researches were carried out on the FeCoCrNi- or WMoTaNb-based alloys fabricated by traditional methods, such as cast and sparking plasma sintering. Recently, additive manufacturing is widely employed in forming FeCoCrNi- and WMoTaNb-based alloys due to its superiority of complex shape forming and flexible materials design, which can intensively meet the requirements in the coming divergent demands for refractory alloy. In present study, WMoTaNbV alloying powder was physically mixed with FeCoCrNi alloying powder and the final mixture was additively manufactured by selective electron beam melting. The as-deposited WMoTaNbVFeCoCrNi RHEA exhibits significant elemental segregation and consists of multiple phases, including body-centered cubic (BCC), face-centered cubic (FCC), and Laves phases. Because of the secondary phase strengthening and microstructure refinement strengthening as well as solid solute strengthening, the as-deposited WMoTaNbVFeCoCrNi RHEA has an outstanding Vickers hardness of 836 ± 17 HV at least and a compressive yield strength of 915 ± 47 MPa at 1200 °C. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Additive manufacturing; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Refractory high-entropy alloy; Selective electron beam melting","3D printers; Additives; Alloying; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Electron beam melting; Electron beams; Entropy; High-entropy alloys; Iron alloys; Spark plasma sintering; Tantalum alloys; Ternary alloys; Vickers hardness; Alloy system; As-cast; Complex shapes; High entropy alloy system; High entropy alloys; Manufacturing IS; Plasma sintering; Refractory high-entropy alloy; Selective electron beam melting; Systems research; Microstructure","","","","","Northwest Institute for Non-ferrous Metal Research; State Key Laboratory of Porous Metal Materials","The authors thank the State Key Laboratory of Porous Metal Materials, Northwest Institute for Non-ferrous Metal Research (China) for providing the research funding.","Yeh J.W., Chen S.K., Lin S.J., Gan J.Y., Chin T.S., Shun T.T., Tsau C.H., Chang S.Y., Nanostructured high-entropy alloys with multiple principal elements: novel alloy design concepts and outcomes, Adv.

Apart from the analysis regarding the influence of the manufacturing technique, the effect of the layer orientation with respect to the direction of the applied load will be also analysed, since the additive manufacturing technique is a layer-wise technology that can induce anisotropy in the material. An extensive experimental program was carried out to determine the tensile, fracture, fatigue life and fatigue crack growth behaviours. The main novelty of this work lies, for the first time in polymers, in the use of the perspective of the Kitagawa-Takahashi diagrams for infinite fatigue life and by analogy their extension to failure. © 2022 The Author(s)","Fatigue limit;

In this study, a cemented carbide with AlSi10Mg alloy binder was fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM). The processing parameters were optimized through response surface methodology (RSM). The microstructure and mechanical properties of SLMed cast tungsten carbide (CC) - 40 wt% AlSi10Mg were studied. The SLMed carbide of CC - AlSi10Mg had much finer grain size of AlSi10Mg binder as compared with that of SLMed AlSi10Mg (1.9 μm vs. 7.3 μm). Noticeable metallurgical interaction between CC and AlSi10Mg binder was observed for SLMed carbide, which enhanced the bonding strength between CC and AlSi10Mg. SLMed carbide showed good Vickers hardness (236 ± 10 HV3), compression strength (639 ± 13 MPa), and abrasion wear resistance (0.47 ± 0.03 × 10−3 mm3N−1 m−1). © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","AlSi10Mg; Cemented carbide; Mechanical property; Microstructure; Selective laser melting","Aluminum alloys; Aluminum compounds; Binders; Fabrication; Selective laser melting; Tungsten carbide; Vickers hardness; Wear resistance; Additive manufacture; Al-alloy; Cemented carbides; Low melting point; Mechanical behavior; Metal binders; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Processing parameters; Response-surface methodology; Selective laser melting; Microstructure","","","","","Foshan Science and Technology Innovation Team project, (FS0AA-KJ919-4402-0023); Heyuan Science and Technology Project, (HEKE 000781); Jihua Laboratory Project, (X190061UZ190); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, (2017B090911006); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province","The authors appreciate the financial support from Science and Technology Project of Guangdong Province , P.

The current state of 3D printing in Ukraine was analyzed in terms of new developments (startups), research areas, and direct implementation of additive manufacturing techniques. The main scientific and research teams that were actively engaged in the development and implementation of additive manufacturing techniques in Ukraine since the end of the 1990s were addressed. They include those involved in research of selective laser sintering for ceramic powders produced from refractory ZrO2–TiO2 and TiN–TiB2 compounds conducted at the Frantsevich Institute for Problems of Materials Science, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, and research intended to produce 3D parts by fused deposition of metals or alloys called xBeam 3D Metal Printing conducted at the Paton Electric Welding Institute, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. This technique found its commercial implementation in the Chervona Hvilya PJSC startup. The paper discusses the main trends in the development of new equipment for 3D printing with ceramics, polymer/ceramic materials, and metals and alloys, as well as experiments combining different materials to achieve new properties. The latest experiments on the shape of materials are presented. They involve the formation of lattice structures that not only reduce the weight of parts but also impart properties that are comparable to those of dense materials. The main attention is paid to the overview of up-to-date capabilities and prospects for the use of additive manufacturing techniques and materials in national materials science. Attention is also focused on prospects for producing parts of complex shape for various functional purposes from ceramics, metals, and associated composites. © 2023, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","3D printing; additive manufacturing techniques; ceramics; materials science; metals; polymers","Additives; Industrial research; Laser heating; Powder metals; Sintering; Tin compounds; Titanium dioxide; Zirconia; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Additive manufacturing technique; Ceramic; Ceramic-metal; Manufacturing techniques; Material science; National academy of sciences of ukraine; Property; Ukraine; 3D printing","","","","","","","A House to Be 3D Printed First Time in Ukraine: Where Exactly [In Ukrainian]; ISO/ASTM International Standard, (2015); Ragulya A.V., Zgalat-Lozynskyy O.B., Laser sintering of multilayer gradient materials, Functional Gradient Materials and Surface Layers, pp. 151-159, (2001); Ragulya A.V., Stetsenko V.P., Vereshchak V.M., Klimenko V.P., Skorokhod V.V., Selective laser sintering.

The development of additive manufacturing (AM) enables the prototyping of copper components rapidly and cost-effectively. Especially, Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), one of the AM techniques, now can fabricate pure copper components with complex geometries. However, the high reflection of laser energy in pure copper at the wavelength used in most commercial fiber laser AM machines poses a challenge in industry practice. To circumvent this problem, higher laser power, different laser wavelength, or different energy source (such as electron) have to be adopted, which alleviates the problem of low laser energy absorptivity, but leads to the undesirable tradeoff between the mechanical properties and thermal/electrical performance. In the current study, the high-precision LPBF (HP-LPBF) combining fine beam and small layer thickness managed to achieve enhanced strength and ductility, while keeping the thermal and electrical conductivity close to the annealed one without heat treatment. Utilising small layer thickness with scan strategy of 67° rotation angle, the columnar grain growth was inhibited, which weakened the anisotropy of material properties. As a result, pure copper by HP-LPBF outperforms those by conventional PBF in mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties with reduced anisotropy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Anisotropy; High-precision laser powder bed fusion (HP-LPBF); Mechanical properties; Pure copper; Thermal and electrical conductivity","Copper compounds; Electric conductivity; Fabrication; Fiber lasers; Grain growth; Anisotropic material properties; Copper components; High-precision; High-precision laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Laser's energy; Layer thickness; Powder bed; Pure copper; Thermal and electrical conductivity; Anisotropy","","","","","Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU; Chinese University of Hong Kong, CUHK, (1-CD4H, 15228621); Chinese University of Hong Kong, CUHK; Shun Hing Institute of Advanced Engineering, SHIAE","This work was supported by project RNE-p2-21 of the Shun Hing Institute of Advanced Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and The authors would like to thank GRF Project of 15228621 and Projects ZE1W and 1-CD4H from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.","Davis J.R., Copper and copper alloys, (2001); Silbernagel C., Ashcroft I., Dickens P., Electrical resistivity of additively manufactured AlSi10Mg for use in electric motors, Addit.

This difficulty is compounded by the fact that the regions of small-scale behavior are not fixed, but change in time as the geometry is produced. While much work in recent years has been focused on resolving the problem of multiple scales in space, there has been less work done on multiscale approaches for the temporal discretization of LPBF problems. In the present contribution, we extend on a previously introduced two-level method in space by combining it with a multiscale time integration method. The unique transfer of information through the transmission conditions allows for interaction between the space and time scales while reducing computational costs. At the same time, all of the advantages of the two-level method in space (namely its geometrical flexibility and the ease in which one may deploy structured, uniform meshes) remain intact. Adopting the proposed multiscale time integration scheme, we observe a computational speed-up by a factor ×2.44 compared to the same two-level approach with uniform time integration, when simulating a laser source traveling on a bare plate of nickel-based superalloy material following an alternating scan path of fifty laser tracks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","High-fidelity thermal model; Immersed boundary method; Laser powder bed fusion; Spatiotemporal methods; Two-level method","Integration; Nickel alloys; Turbulent flow; High-fidelity; High-fidelity thermal model; Immersed boundary methods; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Multiple scale; Powder bed; Spatio-temporal methods; Thermal model; Two level methods; Thermoanalysis","","","","","Italian Minister of University and Research; Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR, (20173C478N, 2017L7X3CS)","This work was partially supported by the Italian Minister of University and Research through the MIUR-PRIN projects “A BRIDGE TO THE FUTURE: Computational methods, innovative applications, experimental validations of new materials and technologies” (No. 2017L7X3CS ) and “ XFAST-SIMS ” (no. 20173C478N ).","King W.E., Anderson A.T., Ferencz R.M., Hodge N.E., Kamath C., Khairallah S.A., Rubenchik A.M., Laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing of metals; physics, computational, and materials challenges, Appl.

However, it is difficult to predict or reconstruct the state of melt pool overlapping because melt pools are affected in each processing stage (deposition, melting, and solidification). Moreover, the impact of melt pool overlapping on microstructure and properties is still unclear. Here, a novel reconstruction model was established for melt pool overlapping by using Python during laser powder bed fusion. Melt-pool dimensions used in this model can be derived using experiments or predicted through normalized enthalpy. The “overlapping unit” was proposed to be a result of the periodic regulation of deposition, which helps in simplifying the microstructure formed through multiple melting and layer-wise deposition. Subsequently, the overlapping effect and its impact on elemental losses, defect formation, and microstructure evolution were investigated; the results were elucidated based on the average number of melting cycles (NMC) of the “overlapping unit” and the calculated thermal history. It can be concluded that the loss of elements with low boiling points (Mg in our alloy) is positively correlated with NMC due to repeated vaporization. Most incomplete defects are formed in regions melted less than twice, while hole defects are found predominantly in regions melted more than six times. Furthermore, the fine-grained area (average diameter ≤ 1 µm) tends to vary with both melt pool overlapping and heat accumulation. Moreover, an increase in sample temperature due to overlapping can augment the number and size of precipitates. Overall, this work offers a new way to improve the microstructure and mechanical properties of materials by optimizing overlapping conditions. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Heat accumulation; Melt pool prediction; Overlapping effect; Powder bed fusion","Additives; Defects; Forecasting; Lakes; Laser heating; Magnesium alloys; Melting; Microstructure; Powder metallurgy; Selective laser melting; Sintering; Heat accumulation; Melt pool; Melt pool prediction; Melting cycle; Multiple melting; Overlapping effect; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion; Prediction methods; Processing technologies; Deposition","","","","","Major Special Science and Technology Project of Yunnan Province, (202002AB080001-3); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51425402, 51671073, 52001001); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China 51671073 , 52001001 , 51425402 and Major Special Science and Technology Project of Yunnan Province 202002AB080001-3 .

Hence, severe knock-down factors on their theoretical buckling loads are typically prescribed in design specifications, which greatly impair their structural efficiency. With the aim of enhancing load-bearing resistance and reducing sensitivity to imperfections, the shape optimisation and assessment of compressed free-form wavy cylindrical shells, the realisation of which is now viable through additive manufacturing, are the subject of the present study. The adopted optimisation framework employs the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm, integrating computer-aided geometric design, nonlinear numerical simulations and imperfection sensitivity analyses. The structural performance of the optimised free-form wavy shells is analysed and compared to that of reference circular shells, as well as other types of non-circular shell profiles, including sinusoidally corrugated shells, Aster shells and stringer-stiffened shells. The optimised free-form wavy shell profiles are shown to exhibit increases in ultimate stress of up to 136% compared with the reference circular shell profiles; in general, greater benefits are achieved for more slender cross-sections. In future work, the proposed optimised shells will be manufactured in stainless steel by means of powder bed fusion (PBF), and their structural performance will be further verified through physical experiments. © 2022 The Authors","3D printing;

This necessitates the development of power electronics packages with enhanced thermal characteristics that fulfill the electrical insulation requirements. The present research investigates the feasibility of using ceramic additive manufacturing (AM), also known as three-dimensional (3-D) printing, to address thermal and electrical requirements in packaging gallium nitride (GaN)-based high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs). The goal is to exploit design freedom and manufacturing flexibility provided by ceramic AM to fabricate power device packages with a lower junction-to-ambient thermal resistance (Rθ JA). Ceramic AM also enables incorporation of intricate 3-D features into the package structure in order to control the isolation distance between the package source and drain contact pads. Moreover, AM allows to fabricate different parts of the packaging assembly as a single structure to avoid high thermal resistance interfaces. For example, the ceramic package and the ceramic heatsink can be printed as a single part without any bonding layer. Thermal simulations under different thermal loading and cooling conditions show the improvement of thermal performance of the package fabricated by ceramic AM. If assisted by an efficient cooling strategy, the proposed package has the potential to reduce RθJA by up to 48%.

In this study, a comparative study of a non-weldable superalloy IN738 fabricated through the laser directed energy deposition (DED) without preheating the base plate and the electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF) with preheating up to the upper bound of ductility dip temperature range was performed. With appropriate process parameters, a steep and unidirectional temperature gradient, a sufficiently high cooling rate at the liquid/solid interface, and a relatively low cooling rate at the γ′ solvus are obtained simultaneously in the EB-PBF process. The prevalence of these conditions results in the growth of well-aligned columnar dendrites, mitigates the elemental segregation, reduces the built-in microscopic defects, and lowers the stored deformation energy. Consequently, cracking is successfully prevented and reasonable room temperature tensile properties are achieved in the as-printed EB-PBF product. Moreover, recrystallization is not triggered during the post-printing heat treatment, and thus the <001> fiber texture is preserved. This study provides a detailed understanding of the critical factors that need to overcome for producing directionally solidified superalloys through additive manufacturing. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Columnar dendrite growth; Cracking prevention; Directionally solidified Ni-based superalloys; Electron beam powder bed fusion; Laser directed energy deposition","3D printers; Additives; Cooling; Cracks; Deposition; Nickel alloys; Preheating; Superalloys; Textures; Columnar dendrite growth; Columnar dendrites; Cracking prevention; Dendrite growth; Directed energy; Directionally solidified; Directionally solidified ni-based superalloy; Electron beam powder bed fusion; Electron-beam; Energy depositions; Laser directed energy deposition; Ni-based superalloys; Powder bed; Electron beams","","","","","Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR, (A18B1b0061); Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51901026, 51927801, 52005508); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Academy of Space Technology, CAST, (20200321); China Academy of Space Technology, CAST; National Major Science and Technology Projects of China, (2019-IV-003-0070); National Major Science and Technology Projects of China; Shanxi Provincial Key Research and Development Project, (2022GY-383); Shanxi Provincial Key Research and Development Project","This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51901026 , 51927801 , 52005508 ), the National Science and Technology Major Project of China (Grant No. 2019-IV-003-0070 ) and the Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province (Grant No. 2022GY-383 ).

Additive manufacturing (AM) overcomes the machining difficulties and may provide the geometric freedom. Whereas the metallurgical defects in AM limits their applications, and the multicaloric effects of AM metamagnetic shape memory alloys have been poorly understood. Here, Ni45Mn44Sn11 metamagnetic shape memory alloys are prepared via laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF). A magnetic entropy change of 10.2 J kg−1 K−1 and adiabatic temperature change of 0.8 K is achieved under the external field change of 5 T and 1.5 T, respectively. An improved relative density of ∼99.5% and high compressive strength of 519 MPa is achieved. These result from the defects mitigation which shows homogeneous grain structure/composition and crack healing during rapid printing and subsequent annealing. Particularly, we have proposed a multicaloric approach of “magnetic-field-assisted elastocaloric cooling” to enhance the temperature change up to 7.4 K, which is 20% higher than the sole elastocaloric effect. These results provide a basis for future studies of the multicaloric effect in metamagnetic shape memory alloys fabricated via AM. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Crack healing; Metamagnetic shape memory alloy; Multicaloric effect; Powder bed fusion","Additives; Compressive strength; Cracks; Manganese alloys; Shape-memory alloy; Tin alloys; Caloric effects; Crack-healing; Geometric freedom; Laser powders; Metallurgical defects; Metamagnetic; Metamagnetic shape memory alloy; Multicaloric effect; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion; 3D printers","","","","","Scientific Research Project of Anhui Universities, (KJ2021A1106); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51971232); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LD21E010001); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFB3501203); Ningbo Municipal Science and Technology Innovative Research Team, (2020Z063)","This work is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2021YFB3501203 ), Ningbo Science and Technology Innovation 2025 Major Project (Grant No. 2020Z063 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51971232 ), Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. LD21E010001 ), Scientific Research Project of Anhui Universities ( KJ2021A1106 ).","Moya X., Mathur N.D., Caloric materials for cooling and heating, Science, 370, pp. 797-803, (2020); Gutfleisch O., Willard M.A., Bruck E., Chen C.H., Sankar S.G., Liu J.P., Magnetic materials and devices for the 21st century: stronger, lighter, and more energy efficient, Adv.

In addition to some of the properties of the parts, there are also some inherent aspects of AM techniques that hinder their applicability. In this respect, the application of calcium sulfate parts manufactured by binder jetting (BJ), as expendable casting elements, is limited by both the high quantity of volatile substances, due to the BJ process, and their low compression resistance. In this work, a novel part post-processing procedure is presented. This procedure consists of applying various heat treatments, in combination with a vacuum infiltration process using an Epsom salt solution. The procedure reduces the volatile content of BJ AM parts and enhances the compression strength with little modification to the part geometry. This post-processing substantially improves the applicability of BJ AM parts as expendable casting elements. After presenting this novel procedure and analyzing the significant enhancement of the properties of the AM calcium sulfate parts (i.e. permeability, the reduction of volatile content and reduction of compressive strength), a case study is presented with an expendable mold for aluminum casting. This procedure allows for a safer casting process, improves the part's surface quality and reduces the internal porosity of the cast parts. © 2022 The Authors","Binder jetting; Calcium sulfate; Casting expendable elements; Epsom salt; Vacuum infiltration","Casting; Compressive strength; Driers (materials); Molds; % reductions; Binder jetting; Casting expendable element; Casting mold; Epsom salt; Manufacturing techniques; Post-processing procedure; Property; Vacuum infiltration; Volatiles content; Calcium sulfate","","","","","Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU; Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras, FEDER, (DPI2017–89840-R)","This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities and FEDER, through a research project with the reference DPI2017–89840-R .","Campbell I., Bourell D., Gibson I., Additive manufacturing: rapid prototyping comes of age, Rapid Prototyp.

The fracture assessment of components with different constraint levels manufactured by SLM is critical for the safety of engineering applications. This paper aims to better understand the effect of constraint on the fracture behavior of SLMed AlSi10Mg alloy. Fracture toughness tests were conducted on specimens with varying crack depth and specimen thickness. The results show that the fracture toughness Jc decreases with increasing crack depth and specimen thickness. The constraint level of each specimen was characterized by the constraint parameter ϕ. The unified correlation line of normalized fracture toughness Jc/Jref with ϕ was obtained, which can be used to evaluate the fracture property of components with arbitrary constraint levels. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Constraint effect;

Currently, there are few purpose-built devices, which aim to enhance the ease and reproducibility of generating such tissue. Most ALI cultures utilize stainless steel grids or cell culture inserts to elevate the matrix or scaffold to the surface of the culture media. In this study, a novel buoyant epithelial culture device (BECD) was designed to both contain a fibroblast-seeded collagen hydrogel and float in culture media, thereby automatically maintaining the ALI without further user intervention. BECDs aim to mitigate several issues associated with ALI culture; reducing the chance of media flooding the epithelial layer from physical disturbance, reducing technique sensitivity for less-experienced users, and improving the reproducibility of the epithelia generated. H400 oral squamous cell carcinoma cells cultured in BECDs for 7, 14, and 21 days showed continuous increase in epithelial tissue thickness with expected localization of epithelial differentiation markers: cytokeratin 5, involucrin, and E-cadherin. Fused filament fabrication three-dimensional printing with polypropylene used in BECD production allows for rapid turnover and design iteration, presenting a versatile, adaptable, and useful tool for application in in vitro cell culture. Developing pharmaceuticals and improving understanding of cell biology requires biomimetic models, ranging from two-dimensional cell cultures to in vivo animal studies. Three-dimensional (3D) cultures provide a cellular architecture resembling in vivo tissue, with a reduced need for expensive and ethically questioned animal studies. This article outlines a 3D printed device for producing stratified epithelia typically found in cutaneous and mucosal tissues. These devices were designed to improve ease of use and reproducibility, while reducing cost compared with current methods and are shown to produce tissue with histological structure and differentiation similar to in vivo stratified epithelia.  © 2022 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","air-liquid interface; epithelial rafts; fused filament fabrication; oral mucosal equivalents; stratified epithelial tissue","Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cells, Cultured; Culture Media; Epithelial Cells; Epithelium; Humans; Mouth Neoplasms; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Reproducibility of Results; 3D printers; Animals; Biomimetics; Cell culture; Cells; Histology; Iterative methods; Phase interfaces; Polypropylenes; Scaffolds (biology); Tissue; collagen; collagen gel; cytokeratin 5; hydrogel; involucrin; polypropylene; stainless steel; uvomorulin; Air liquid interfaces; Culture medium; Epithelial raft; Epithelial tissue; Fused filament fabrication; In-vitro; In-vivo; Oral mucosal equivalent; Reproducibilities; Stratified epithelial tissue; air liquid interface; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; cell culture; controlled study; decontamination; epithelium; fibroblast; fused deposition modeling; immersion; immunofluorescence; in vitro study; instrument sterilization; keratinocyte; nonhuman; three dimensional printing; culture medium; epithelium; epithelium cell; human; mouth tumor; reproducibility; squamous cell carcinoma; three dimensional printing; Fabrication","","collagen, 9007-34-5; involucrin, 60108-77-2; polypropylene, 25085-53-4, 9003-07-0; stainless steel, 12597-68-1; uvomorulin, 112956-45-3; Culture Media, ","","","GlaxoSmithKline, GSK; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, BBSRC, (BB/T508329/1)","This work was jointly supported by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC; reference BB/T508329/1), and GlaxoSmithKline as part of an iCASE PhD studentship.

Very recently, high-pressure torsion (HPT) has emerged as an effective approach to significantly reduce porosity content in AM-fabricated metallic components, accompanied with considerably improved mechanical and functional properties. However, the mechanism behind the porosity elimination in additively manufactured metallic parts processed by HPT has not been fully understood yet. In this study, the porosity evolution in additively manufactured 316L SS before and after HPT processing is extensively investigated using microscopy techniques, including optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It is revealed that significant reduction in porosity level and average pore size could be obtained even with a relatively small range of equivalent strain, εeq.-HPT ≤ 5 after 1/4 HPT revolution. Upon further straining to 1 HPT revolution (εeq.-HPT = 13.6), the pores are completely closed, and the bulk material can be considered pore-free. Based on OM, SEM, and TEM analysis, it can be inferred that the porosity closure mechanism is attributed to the creation of strong atomic bond by the release of internal sub-surfaces and formation of nano-scale grain (NG) microstructures that holds the bulk material, resulting from the HPT-induced combined hydrostatic pressure and extreme torsional strain. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","316L stainless steel; Additive manufacturing; High-pressure torsion; Laser powder bed fusion; Porosity; Severe plastic deformation","3D printers; Additives; Austenitic stainless steel; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hydrostatic pressure; Nanotechnology; Pore size; Strain; Torsional stress; 316 L stainless steel; Bulk materials; Electron transmission; High pressure torsions; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Mechanical performance; Metal additives; Powder bed; Severe plastic deformations; Scanning electron microscopy","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS /1/2021/TK0/UTM/02/84)","This research was funded by the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) Malaysia through the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS /1/2021/TK0/UTM/02/84).

Here, we investigate the application of a novel synchronized circular laser array in the powder bed fusion technique to alter the microstructure of printed parts toward the preferable equiaxed grains. This feat is not achievable with the single laser powder bed fusion technique for Ti–6Al–4 V alloy. The temporal temperature distributions for different process parameters (laser power, scanning speed, and internal distance between lasers in the array) were obtained by an anisotropic heat transfer model, and the Hunt criterion was employed to construct the solidification map. The results revealed that a degree of overlap between lasers is recommended to form a coherent melt pool, avoid degeneracy in surface quality, and maintain adequate resolution for all processing windows. However, laser overlap is not required for low scanning speed and high power scenarios. Finally, microstructure prediction shows that 45% of printed track includes equiaxed grains at a high power regime (500 W). However, the volume fraction of the equiaxed microstructure is reduced by decreasing laser power. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Digital twin;

However, poor surface finish and dimension discrepancy in the manufactured stents can significantly affect not only their own mechanical behavior but also mechanical response of arteries. This study investigates the effects of surface irregularities and dimension discrepancy of a 316L stainless steel stent, manufactured using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), on its biomechanical performance, in comparison with the original design and a commercial stent. In silico simulations of stent deployment in a patient-specific coronary artery, based on intravital optical coherency tomography imaging, are conducted to assess the stent deformation as well as arterial stress and damage. Severe plastic strain concentrations (with a maximum value of 1.93) occur in the LPBF stent after deployment due to surface irregularities, suggesting a high risk of stent fracture. The LPBF stent is harder to expand due to its thicker struts and closed-cell design (diameter of 4.14 mm at the peak inflating pressure during deployment, compared to 4.58 mm and 4.65 mm for the designed and MULTI-LINK RX ULTRA stents, respectively). Also, the LPBF stent induces a higher level of stress concentration (with a maximum value of 23.04 MPa) to the arterial layers, suggesting a higher risk of tissue damage and in-stent restenosis. This study demonstrates a clear need for further development of the AM process for manufacturing medical implants, especially the surface finish and dimension accuracy. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; Arterial damage; Dimension discrepancy; Metallic stent; Surface finish","Coronary Vessels; Humans; Stainless Steel; Stents; Additives; Austenitic stainless steel; Finishing; Stents; stainless steel; 316 L stainless steel; Arterial damage; Dimension discrepancy; In-silico; Laser powders; Metallic stents; Patient specific; Powder bed; Stainless steel stents; Surface finishes; Article; computer aided design; computer simulation; coronary artery; finite element analysis; human; in-stent restenosis; inflation pressure; neointima; optical coherence tomography; powder bed fusion; stent deformation; stent fracture; tissue injury; x-ray computed tomography; coronary blood vessel; stent; 3D printers","","stainless steel, 12597-68-1; Stainless Steel, ","Mimics, Materialise, Belgium","Materialise, Belgium","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/R001650/1); Loughborough University, Lboro","Funding text 1: We acknowledge the support from the EPSRC UK (Grant No.: EP/R001650/1; Title: Smart peripheral stents for the lower extremity - design, manufacturing and evaluation).

We report an additive manufacturing protocol through vat photopolymerization 3D printing to fabricate the architectured conductive silicon carbide (SiC) ceramics that simultaneously possess high electrical conductivity as well as low thermal conductivity, and demonstrate electric reliability under high-temperature environments above 600°C. The percolation of graphene into the ceramic scaffold establishes a uniform conductive network, exhibiting its electrical conductivity up to 1000 S m−1. The bulk density of the 3D-printed ceramic is measured from 0.366 g cm−3 to 0.897 g cm−3, with thermal conductivity ranging from 62 mW m−1 K−1 to 88 mW m−1 K−1. Furthermore, the mechanical performance of conductive ceramic can be effectively reinforced by densifying the microstructures via spark plasma sintering treatment. The proposed additive manufacturing strategy widens the potential of ceramics as a structural and functional material, offering a promising pathway toward high-temperature electronics applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Electrically conductive ceramics; Multiscale structures; Spark plasma sintering; Thermal insulation","Additives; Ceramic materials; Electric conductivity; Functional materials; Photopolymerization; Scaffolds; Silicon carbide; Solvents; Spark plasma sintering; Thermal conductivity; Thermal insulation; Catalysts support; Conductive ceramics; Electrically conductive; Electrically conductive ceramic; Electrode conductors; High conductivity; High-temperature environment; Mechanical; Multi-scale structures; Spark-plasma-sintering; 3D printers","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CMMI- 1846863); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE; Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL, (FA8650–20-2–5506); Building Technologies Office, BTO, (DE-EE0008675)","This manuscript is approved by all the authors for publication.

The benefits of AM have not yet been explored on metal case structures of prismatic battery cells. The method allows the manufacturing of complex hollow structures and integration of multiple functions in one part. The main challenge is to address thermal management in an optimal location in the battery cell. More efficient charging and discharging by maintaining the batteries at optimum operating conditions allows a longer battery lifetime. Recent research shows that elevating the charging temperature enables significantly shorter charging times. The aim of this study is to develop a lid structure to support higher peak current, faster charging, and reduced production steps and enable mass customization. The optimum performance simulated with computational fluid dynamics calculations is realized to determine the optimum design. The design case study is verified via laser powder bed fusion prototypes. This study shows that it is possible to produce integrated thermal management liquid channels to the battery lid. Significant improvement is achieved with localized battery cell temperature management. The novel design integrates six critical functionalities of the lid in one part. The design of the features is optimized to avoid support structures in AM and to maximize the number of parts in the printing chamber volume. The better thermal management extends the driving range of the vehicle and improves vehicle safety. Reducing the parts significantly simplifies cell production.  © 2022 Author(s).","","Aluminum; Charging (batteries); Computational fluid dynamics; Manufacture; Secondary batteries; Temperature control; Vehicle safety; Aluminium case; Battery cells; Case structures; Electrical vehicles; Laser powders; Manufacturing design; Metal case; One parts; Powder bed; Vehicle applications; Powder metals","","","","","LUT University","The authors would like to express their gratitude to the City of Turku and Machine Technology Centre for its contributions to this study.

In comparison to an injection molding process for thermoplastic parts, the additive manufacturing process fused deposition modeling leads to an inhomogeneous structure with trapped air inside the volume. In this paper, a neural network-based expert system is presented that provides the user with process knowledge in order to improve the weld seam quality of laser welded additively manufactured parts. Both additive manufacturing and LTW process are assisted by the expert system. First, the designed expert system supports the user in setting up the additive manufacturing process to increase the transmissivity. During welding, the additive manufacturing and LTW process parameters are used to predict the weld seam strength. To create the database for the expert system, specimens of transparent and black polylactide are additively manufactured. In order to change the transmissivity at an emission wavelength of 940 nm of the diode laser used, the manufacturing parameters for the transparent parts are varied. The transmissivity of the parts is measured with a spectroscope. The transparent samples are welded to the black samples with laser powers between 8 and 14 W in the overlap configuration and shear tensile tests are performed. In this work, the predictions of the transmissivity and the shear tensile force are demonstrated with an accuracy of more than 88.1% of the neural networks used for the expert system. © 2022 Author(s).","","3D printers; Expert systems; Injection molding; Reinforced plastics; Tensile testing; Thermoplastics; Welds; Additive manufacturing process; Inhomogeneous structure; Injection molding process; Laser transmission welding; Network-based; Neural-networks; Process knowledge; Seam quality; Transmissivity; Weld seam; Additives","","","","","German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action; Allianz Industrie Forschung, AiF","The IGF-project “Qualitätssicherung beim Laserstrahlschweißen additiv gefertigter thermoplastischer Bauteile -QualLa” (No. 21571N) of the Research Community for Quality (FQS), August-Schanz-Straße 21A, 60433 Frankfurt/Main, has been funded by the AiF within the programme for sponsorship by Industrial Joint Research (IGF) of the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action based on an enactment of the German Parliament.","Gibson I., Roesen D.W., Strucker B., Additive Manufacturing Technologies, (2010); Potente H., Fügen von Kunststoffen: Grundlagen, Verfahren, Anwendung, (2004); Kuklik J., Henkel C., Wippo V., Jaeschke P., Kaierle S., Overmeyer L., Laser transmission welding of additive manufactured components, Proceedings of the 38th International Congress on Applications of Lasers & Electro-Optics (ICALEO 2019), (2019); Vazques-Martinez J.M., Pinero D., Salguero J., Batista M., Evaluation of the joining response of biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) from fused deposition modeling by infrared laser irradiation, Polymers, 12, (2020); Kuklik J., Wippo V., Jaeschke P., Et al., Laser transmission welding of additive manufactured parts: Process modifications to reduce cavities inside the weld seam, Proceedings of the 11th CIRP Conference on Photonic Technologies (LANE 2020), (2020); Kuklik J., Wippo V., Jaeschke P., Kaierle S., Overmeyer L., Investigations on the transmissivity and scattering behavior of additively manufactured components for laser transmission welding applications, Proceedings of the Lasers in Manufacturing Conference 2021 (LiM2021), (2021); Acherjee B., Mondal S., Tudu B., Misra D., Application of artificial neural network for predicting weld quality in laser transmission welding of thermoplastics, Appl.

This study fabricated porous graphene oxide (GO)/HA composite ceramic scaffolds using digital light processing (DLP) technology. The properties of the composite ceramic slurry and the process parameters of curing, degreasing, and sintering were initially examined to ensure molding accuracy. The research showed that a small amount of GO (0.1–0.4 wt%) could better maintain the pore structure and improve the mechanical properties of composite ceramics. Porous scaffolds with pore sizes of 300–400 μm were prepared for co-culture with rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to detect biocompatibility. The results showed that all scaffolds have no cytotoxicity. Compared with HA, the GO/HA ceramic scaffold significantly promoted the cell adhesion, proliferation, and expression of osteogenesis-related genes; GO (0.1–0.2 wt%) /HA scaffolds exhibited superior alkaline phosphatase activity and more effective bone mineralization, showing enhanced osteoinductivity. The porous GO/HA composite scaffold fabricated by DLP presented a strong potential for repairing bone defects. © 2022","Curability; Digital light processing; Graphene oxide (GO); Hydroxyapatite (HA); Molding quality; Osteogenic activity","Biocompatibility; Biomechanics; Bone; Cell adhesion; Cell culture; Graphene; Molding; Phosphatases; Pore size; Pore structure; Repair; Scaffolds (biology); Sintering; Stem cells; Composite ceramic; Curability; Digital light processing; Graphene oxide; Graphene oxides; Hydroxyapatite; Molding quality; Osteogenic activity; Osteoinductivity; Processing technologies; Hydroxyapatite","","","","","Rongxiang Regeneration Medicine Fund of Shandong University, (2019SDRX-11); Shandong University, SDU, (2020SDUCRCB001); Shandong University, SDU; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, (ZR2021QE286); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province; Shandong Jianzhu University, SDJZU, (X21033Z, ZR2020MH180); Shandong Jianzhu University, SDJZU","This work was supported in part by grants from the Clinical Research for Crossing Item of Shandong University (2020SDUCRCB001), the Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation (ZR2021QE286), the Shandong Jianzhu University Doctoral Fund Project (X21033Z), the Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation (ZR2020MH180) and the Rongxiang Regeneration Medicine Fund of Shandong University (2019SDRX-11).

The proposed configurable platform enables hybrid manufacturing, because the bulk of the part can be manufactured with traditional methods and the complex part with AM combining the best qualities of both. The main objective was to find a new way of combining manufacturing techniques to reduce costs both in printing and in the postprocessing phase of production. Mechanical testing and microstructural analysis were used to verify the joint quality and strength between the printed part and the sheet metal. PBF-LB manufacturing was experimented directly on 316L and P355GH sheet metal steels, and in both cases, the results showed that the joints did not degrade the material properties. In addition to specimens for tensile testing, parts for a flexural bending machine were manufactured as a proof of concept. The module platform was successfully used to manufacture parts with reduced material cost and printing time, and the print job could be performed without any support structures, obviating the need for post processing. The proposed platform design can be used not only as a new tool for improving the production efficiency of the PBF-LB technique, but also to overcome some of the limitations in part design.  © 2022 Author(s).","","Cost reduction; Processing; Production efficiency; Tensile testing; Complex parts; Configurable platform; Joint quality; Joint strength; Laser powders; Manufacturing techniques; Microstructural analysis; Powder bed; Reduce costs; Testing analysis; Sheet metal","","","","","Council of Oulu Region; European Commission, EC; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support received from the Council of Oulu Region and the European Union (European Regional Development Fund) for the Hybridi and M3D projects and Business Finland for the DREAMS project.","Culleton M., McDonnell D., Shipley H., Trimble D., Lupoi R., O'Donnell G., Design for additive manufacturing (dfam): The importance of software within selective laser melting (slm), Conference: EUSPEN Special Interest GrouMeeting: Additive Manufacturing; Nyamekye P., Unt A., Salminen A., Piili H., Integration of simulation driven DfAM and LCC analysis for decision making in L-PBF, Metals, 10, (2020); Rautio T., Jalava-Kanervio J., Kumpula J., Makikangas J., Jarvenpaa A., Microstructure and mechanical properties of laser butt welded laser powder bed fusion manufactured and sheet metal 316L parts, Key Eng.

However, traditional manufacturing techniques face challenges in fabricating these structures. Selective laser melting (SLM) can be considered an appropriate alternative for this purpose due to its suitable sophistication and accuracy. Herein, the effects of heat treatment on the mechanical properties and energy absorption capabilities of three triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) structures were investigated using compression tests. After heat treatment, their ultimate elongation increased by more than 120% (from 8.07 to 18.45%). The results also indicate that heat treatment improved the plasticity and energy absorption capability of TPMS structures fabricated via SLM. The compression fracture morphology of samples revealed that the fracture mechanism of TPMS porous structure changed from brittle-to-ductile fracture after a solution treatment of 2 h at 530°C, following which water quenching and artificial aging were performed for 6 h at 170°C. The energy absorption capabilities of the TPMS structures were optimized using heat treatment. After heat treatment, the energy absorption capabilities of the three TPMS structures (Schwarz P, Gyroid, and Schwarz D) at a strain of 50% were 2.76, 8.79, and 16.41 MJ/m3, respectively.

The supports reinforce overhanging regions on the part and/or counteract the thermally-induced residual stresses generated during printing. However, the optimal design of the part for its intended use case is decoupled from the design of the support structures in a conventional design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) workflow. In this work, a novel methodology is presented that simultaneously optimises the part topology and its support structure regions. A two-model topology optimisation approach is considered. One model describes the combined part and support structure regions subject to a pseudo-gravity load and a second model describes the part subject to its intended application load cases. A novel load-aligned trunk and branch support structure is generated from the topology optimisation results. Generating the fine support features in a post-processing step avoids the computational expense of topology optimising the intricate supports directly. Thermo-mechanical simulations of a selective laser melting process confirms that this new approach to optimising support structures can reduce manufacturing process-induced deformation when benchmarked against a conventional DfAM workflow. © 2022, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; Lattice; Support structures; Topology optimisation","Additives; Ground supports; Selective laser melting; Structural design; Structural optimization; Topology; Conventional design; Lattice; Novel methodology; Optimal design; Optimization approach; Simultaneous optimization; Support structures; Thermally induced; Topology optimisation; Work-flows; Shape optimization","","","","","University of Canterbury, UC; College of Engineering, University of Canterbury; Business Economics, University of Canterbury; Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR, (C210112041); New Zealand Institute of Language Brain and Behaviour, University of Canterbury, NZILBB, UC","Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions.

Geometrically reinforced thin plates have been built in nickel–chromium alloy using laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF) and their shapes measured using stereoscopic digital image correlation before and after release from the base-plate of the AM machine. The results show that residual stresses cause potentially severe out-of-plane deformation that can be alleviated using either an enveloping support structure, which increased the build time substantially, was difficult to remove and wasted material, or using buttress supports to the reinforced edges of the thin plate. The buttresses were quick to build and remove, minimised waste but needed careful design. Plates built in a landscape orientation required out-of-plane buttresses while those built in a portrait orientation required both in-plane and out-of-plane buttresses. In both cases, out-of-plane deformation increased on release from the baseplate but this was mitigated by incremental release which resulted in out-of-plane deformations of less than 5% of the in-plane dimensions. © 2022, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; Digital image correlation; Out-of-plane deformation; Residual stresses; Thin plates","3D printers; Additives; Aspect ratio; Chromium alloys; Deformation; Nickel; Plates (structural components); Reinforcement; Residual stresses; Stereo image processing; Strain measurement; Base plates; Complex geometries; Digital image correlations; Manufacturing IS; Metallic component; Nickel chromium; Out-of-plane; Out-of-plane deformations; Residual stress effects; Thin plate; Image correlation","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (20–27082); National Science Foundation, NSF; Center for Selective C-H Functionalization, National Science Foundation; Center for Hierarchical Manufacturing, National Science Foundation, CHM, NSF; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/T013141/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; Neurosciences Foundation, NSF","The research was supported by grants from both the EPSRC (grant no.

However, insufficient material stability and complex procedure about auxiliary supports limit the application based on low viscosity slurry. In this work, we developed a photocurable ceramic paste, in which the high static viscosity and high yield stress characteristics allowed it to exhibit sufficient anti-settling and self-supporting capabilities. The rheological characteristics of the as prepared paste were measured by stress-controlled rheometer, and conformal contactless support was designed including top conformal structure without contact with the crown and appropriate empty layer. The 3D precision of crown was evaluated by laser scanning confocal microscope and optical surface scanner. In addition, mechanical properties and biocompatibility of sintered samples were systematically evaluated. The results demonstrated that the yield stress of the ceramic paste approached around 600 Pa, and integrate morphology at the bottom of the crown with the contactless supported zone was observed. 3D deviation between the printed crown scan data and the reference model was reduced within the range of 40–70 µm. Finally, the flexural strength and fracture toughness of the sintered zirconia ceramics reached 1117 MPa and 7.76 MPa⋅m1/2, respectively, as well as good biocompatibility by the lack of cytotoxicity and hemolytic reaction. The results indicate an important practical significance for the development of vat photopolymerization printing technology of viscoelastic paste and conformal contactless support strategy to realize the integrated manufacturing of ceramic crowns. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Accuracy; Ceramic crown; Conformal contactless support; Vat photopolymerization; Viscoelastic paste","3D printers; Biocompatibility; Fracture toughness; Photopolymerization; Topography; Viscoelasticity; Viscosity; Zirconia; Accuracy; Ceramic crowns; Conformal contactless support; Contact less; Integrated manufacturing; Photo polymerization; Printing technologies; Vat photopolymerization; Viscoelastic paste; Viscoelastics; Sintering","","","","","Open Fund Project of 3D Printing Equipment and Manufacturing Key Laboratory in Jiangsu Province, (3DL202103)","We would like to express gratitude for supporting the research in the field of ceramic stereolithography to Suzhou Key Industrial Technology Innovation Projects (Grant No. SGC2021063 and Grant No. SYG202040 ) and the Open Fund Project of 3D Printing Equipment and Manufacturing Key Laboratory in Jiangsu Province (Grant No. 3DL202103 ).","Sun J., Chen X., Wade-Zhu J., Binner J., Bai J., A comprehensive study of dense zirconia components fabricated by additive manufacturing, Addit.

However, how to control the melt flow in laser metal AM processes to improve surface finish is not clear. Here we reveal the effects of nanoparticles on melt flow behavior at every location of melt pool during laser metal AM process for the first time using Al6061 + TiC nanoparticles system and achieve significant improvement of surface finish by using TiC nanoparticles to control the melt flow and damp the surface wave. Based on the in-situ x-ray imaging observation, the surface wave is fully damped after adding TiC nanoparticles, compared with only 56% damping without nanoparticles during LPBF of Al6061. Our in-depth in-situ x-ray imaging analysis and viscosity measurement enable us to identify that nanoparticle-induced increase of viscosity causes the fully damping of the surface wave by (1) increasing the internal fluid friction for more efficient wave amplitude reduction, (2) controlling the melt flow to increase the surface wave number, (3) controlling the melt flow to increase the wave damping time. Furthermore, we also quantified the relative contributions of increasing fluid friction, increasing wave number and increasing damping time to wave damping, which account for 61%, 25% and 14%, respectively. Our research provides the mechanisms and potential method to address the surface finish challenge in laser metal AM processes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Laser powder bed fusion; Melt flow; Nanocomposites; Surface roughness; Synchrotron x-ray imaging","3D printers; Additives; Damping; Friction; Metal nanoparticles; Metals; Shear flow; Surface waves; Titanium carbide; Ultrasonic waves; Viscosity; Viscosity measurement; Additive manufacturing process; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Melt flow; Metal additives; Powder bed; Surface finishes; Synchrotron x-ray imaging; Synchrotron x-rays; Xray imaging; Surface roughness","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; Argonne National Laboratory, ANL, (DE- AC02-06CH11357); Argonne National Laboratory, ANL; University of Wisconsin-Madison, UW","This work is supported by US National Science Foundation and University of Wisconsin-Madison Startup Fund .

However, the quality of end products depends on the type of filament. In this study, the mechanical properties of the highperformance AM9085F filament subjected to thermal shock stress were analyzed. The V-notch shear test was used to determine the change in the properties of V-notch coupons fabricated using the filament. The coupons were subjected to thermal shock stress through temperature cycling for 180 days. The shear properties of conditioned and unconditioned coupons were examined via experiments, finite element analysis, and an analytical thermal model. The application of thermal shock stress decreased shear strength by 22% and the strain to failure by 16%. Temperature affected the fracture point and loading capacity of the coupons. It was concluded that V-notch testing can be used for determining the shear properties of FFF materials that exhibit similar shear stress and strain during loading until failure owing to the stress concentration caused by the expansion of materials and the variation in the moisture content of materials. © 2023, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","AM9085F; fused filament fabrication; renewable energy; sustainability constituent; thermal shock stress; V-notch shear strength","Shear stress; Stress analysis; Sustainable development; Thermal shock; Am9085f; Fused filament fabrication; Renewable energies; Renewable energy applications; Shear properties; Shears strength; Sustainability constituent; Thermal shock stress; V-notch shear strength; V-notches; Fabrication","","","","","Northern Borders University, (ENGA-2022-11-1128); Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University","Acknowledgments : This project was funded by the Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR) at the Northern Border University (NBU) under Grant number (ENGA-2022-11-1128).

AlSi10Mg products manufactured using the LPBF process allow tailoring the dynamic properties to the needs of applications. Hence, we created a design of experiments based on the Taguchi method to study the effects of the most influential LPBF process parameters. The chosen parameters were laser power, scanning speed, hatching distance, scanning pattern, and fabrication orientation. Using a split Hopkinson pressure bar experimental system, the maximum dynamic stress (MDS) and elongation until fracture were characterized. The dynamic properties were significantly affected: up to a 30% increase in the MDS, without a reduction in elongation was observed. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the fabrication orientation significantly influences the dynamic properties. This study quantitatively correlates the macrostructure of the melt pools and their dynamic properties. There is a close to linear dependency between the crack path following the melt pool boundaries to the MDS. The results obtained from this study can assist engineers in estimating their dynamic response to materials by analyzing the LPBF AlSi10Mg macrostructure. © 2022 The Authors","AlSi10Mg; Design of experiments; Dynamic loading; Laser powder bed fusion; Split Hopkinson pressure bar","Bridge decks; Dynamic loads; Sensitivity analysis; Taguchi methods; Dynamic loadings; Dynamic stress; Dynamics properties; Fusion process; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Macrostructures; Melt pool; Powder bed; Split Hopkinson pressure bars; Design of experiments","","","","","","","Stampfl J., Hatzenbichler M., Additive manufacturing technologies, CIRP Encyclopedia of Production Engineering, pp. 20-27, (2014); DebRoy T., Wei H.L., Zuback J.S., Mukherjee T., Elmer J.W., Milewski J.O., Beese A.M., Wilson-Heid A., De A., Zhang W., Additive manufacturing of metallic components – process, structure and properties, Prog.

The results show that appreciable growth of the Si precipitates at the cellular network boundaries in the as-built microstructure was observed under R = −1. Moreover, significant amorphization of the initial crystalline Si precipitates occurred in the vicinity of the fracture surface under this condition. A layer of fine Al grains was developed in the “fish-eye” region of the fracture surface. These microstructural responses are rationalized by the generation of lattice defects including dislocations and sub-grain boundaries during cyclic pressing of crack surfaces under R = −1, which mediates the Si solute diffusion and re-precipitation in the alloy as well as the amorphization of initial Si crystalline precipitation. In contrast, far fewer dislocations were observed near the crack surfaces under R = 0.5, which is attributed to the absence of cyclic pressing of crack surfaces and severe plastic deformation in this scenario. This work provides insights into the stress ratio dependence of the microstructural evolution in the fatigued Al alloys. The obtained knowledge is useful for future understanding of the fatigue failure in Al alloys produced by additive manufacturing. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","AlSi10Mg alloy; Amorphization; Coarsening; Stress ratio; Very-high-cycle fatigue","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Amorphization; Crack initiation; Fracture; Grain boundaries; High-cycle fatigue; Low-cycle fatigue; Ostwald ripening; Plastic deformation; Precipitation (chemical); Silicon; Al-alloy; Alsi10mg alloy; Amorphizations; Coarsenings; Crack surfaces; Fracture surfaces; Pressung; Si precipitates; Stress ratio; Very-High-Cycle Fatigue; Coarsening","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11872364, 11932020, 11988102, 12072345)","This work was supported by the NSFC Basic Science Center Program for ""Multiscale Problems in Nonlinear Mechanics"" (No.11988102) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Fund Nos. 12072345, 11932020, 11872364).

Currently, lattice structures have wide application prospects due to their excellent mechanical performance and design freedom. This paper provides both experimental and numerical investigations for the failure behaviors of selective laser melting (SLM) Ti6Al4V lattice structures under uniaxial compressive loading. Lattice structures with different cell topologies and strut radii were chosen to conduct quasi-static compression simulations to examine their mechanical properties and failure modes. It is found that adding Z-direction struts in the loading direction could significantly improve the load-carrying capacity and the most superior mechanical properties were presented by FCCZ. The slopes of the double logarithmic relationship between the equivalent stiffness and the relative density of lattice structures can be distinguished as close to 1.0 and 3.0, implying bending-dominated or stretch-dominated behavior of lattice structures, respectively. For stretch-dominated lattice structures under uniaxial compression, FCCZ, BCCZ and FBCCZ, the failure modes would experience a transformation from strut buckling to fracture with the increase of strut radii, which is different from FCC and BCC demonstrated as the bending-dominated lattice structures.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","Additive manufacturing; compressive loading; failure mode; lattice structures; mechanical properties","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Crystal structure; Failure (mechanical); Failure modes; Selective laser melting; Structural properties; Struts; Ternary alloys; Vanadium alloys; Application prospect; Complex designs; Compressive loading; Lattice structures; Manufacturing technologies; Mechanical design; Mechanical failures; Quasi-static; Single parts; Traditional manufacturing; Titanium alloys","","","","","","","Athanker P., Singh A.

Hence, maraging steel M789 was developed to alleviate this issue while maintaining its strength. Most studies of maraging steels processed by additive manufacturing (AM) focus on utilizing laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). However, the research in laser-directed energy deposition (L-DED) fabrication of corrosion-resistant maraging steels is limited. The different cooling rates experienced by materials during L-DED and LPBF processing give rise to differing microstructures and mechanical properties. In this study, the L-DED process was adopted to manufacture nearly-fully dense M789 parts, which were subsequently subjected to direct aging and solutionizing + aging heat treatments. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis reveals a martensitic structure in both as-fabricated and heat-treated samples with the presence of austenite in the as-fabricated and directly aged samples. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD) reveal the presence of Ti- and Al-rich precipitates within the martensites after the solution and aging treatment, suggesting that Orowan looping around precipitates, grain boundary strengthening, and solid solution strengthening are responsible for the high yield strength of L-DED M789. Besides, the as-fabricated alloy shows higher pitting potential than solutioned and aged sample. This work serves as a guidance for the fabrication of corrosion-resistant maraging steels by L-DED and accelerate the implementation of maraging steels for marine and offshore applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Corrosion resistance; Directed energy deposition; Heat treatment; Maraging steel M789; Mechanical properties","3D printers; Additives; Corrosion resistant coatings; Deposition; Fabrication; Grain boundaries; Heat resistance; Heat treatment; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Offshore oil well production; Scanning electron microscopy; Steel corrosion; Cooling rates; Corrosion-resistant; Directed energy; Directed energy deposition; Energy depositions; High strength and toughness; Laser powders; Maraging steel m789; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Powder bed; Corrosion resistance","","","","","Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore, (A18B1b0061); National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF","This research is supported by the National Research Foundation , Prime Minister's Office, Singapore under its Medium-Sized Center funding scheme and Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore via the Structural Metal Alloys Programme (No. A18B1b0061 ).","Svetlizky D., Das M., Zheng B., Vyatskikh A.L., Bose S., Bandyopadhyay A., Schoenung J.M., Lavernia E.J., Eliaz N., Directed energy deposition (DED) additive manufacturing: physical characteristics, defects, challenges and applications, Mater.

Sliding wear behavior in a ball-on-disk configuration with a ball either above or below the disk of the SLM and SPS samples was investigated. A detailed study of the effects of wear debris on the sliding wear behavior was undertaken to clarify the effect of wear debris entrapment in a wear scar. The wear volumes in the as-built SLM samples were slightly higher than in the SPS counterparts in both configurations. Wear volume and coefficient of friction values in the ball-above configuration were significantly lower than in the ball-below configuration. The present results indicated that the wear debris significantly influenced the mechanical contact properties of the HEA, providing new insight into the performance of the new materials in various conditions that could be considered to widen classical approaches by including the fate of the detached particles in the wear process. The impacts of wear debris on the design and application of these novel alloys should be considered. © 2022, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.","","Aluminum alloys; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Friction; Iron alloys; Melting; Selective laser melting; Tribology; Wear debris; Wear of materials; High entropy alloys; Laser spark; Microstructures properties; Selective laser melting; Sliding wear behaviour; Spark-plasma-sintering; Tribological performance; Tribological properties; Wear debris; Wear volume; Spark plasma sintering","","","","","Eesti Teadusagentuur, ETAg, (PRG643); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2020A1515011242, G2021163004L); International Science and Technology Cooperation Programme, ISTCP, (2021A0505050002)","The authors would like to thank Messrs.

In layer-wise manufacturing processes, such as SLM, the evaluation and understanding of the surface characteristics of individual layers of materials are important; however, there is limited work in the literature on the “single-layer” surface characteristics in SLM. Single-layer samples are designed on a smooth surface on top of semi-cylinders and fabricated using different levels of SLM processing parameters, i.e., laser power, scan speed, and hatch spacing, in different numbers of scan lines, i.e., 5, 10, 20, and 40. The fabricated sample surface data are acquired using non-contact optical interferometry. The computational approach utilizes the discrete element method (DEM) for the powder bed distribution, as well as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for simulating the laser-powder interaction. One of the main contributions of this study is to investigate and provide predictive models for the correlations between the surface roughness of raster scans and SLM process parameters through experiments and computational work. In addition, a method for comparing the surface characteristics of the thermo-fluid simulation and experimental results is presented. A technique is employed to extract the surface roughness from the simulated results. The discussion on the experiment-simulation comparison challenges provides a deep insight into the criteria selection for experiment-simulation comparison in the SLM process. Moreover, an artificial neural network was trained using the back-propagation method and K-fold cross-validation, as well as regularization techniques to avoid overfitting. The laser power proved to be the most significant parameter, having a contribution of 48.3%, in determining the surface roughness with a unique trend affected by the spattering of powder particles. The simulation results showed noticeable deviations from the experiments in cases with extreme parameters, e.g., too high or too low values of power, speed, or hatch spacing. The machine learning algorithm achieves reasonable predictability of the single-layer surface roughness, showing a root mean square error and a coefficient of determination of 0.9589 µm and 98.78%, respectively, for a separate testing dataset. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Artificial neural network; Computational fluid dynamics; Discrete element method; Machine learning; Selective laser melting; Surface roughness","Aluminum alloys; Backpropagation; Computational fluid dynamics; Finite difference method; Hatches; Melting; Neural networks; Selective laser melting; Titanium alloys; Torsional stress; Vanadium alloys; Data driven; Discrete elements method; Laser melting process; Laser power; Machine-learning; Process parameters; Selective laser melting; Simulation comparison; Single layer; Surface characteristics; Surface roughness","","","","","U.S. Navy, USN, (N68335-21-C-0168); U.S. Navy, USN","This research has been supported by Technical Data Analysis, Inc. through a Navy STTR project, contract No. N68335-21-C-0168.

First, by adjusting the coupling topology based on the typical 4th-order cross-coupled filter, the spurious mode below the passband is eliminated. Second, an increased-height resonator is proposed to decrease the electric coupling strength to avoid extremely small features, hence effectively reducing the sensitivity to the fabrication tolerances. Third, two types of defected ground structures (DGSs) on the filter shell are introduced to suppress two spurious modes above the passband. The stereolithography apparatus (SLA) 3-D printing with the electroplating copper plating technique is utilized to fabricate this filter for demonstration. A good agreement between simulated and experimental results verifies this design method.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","3-D printing; Bandpass filter; defected ground structure (DGS); mm-wave; spurious suppression; waveguide","5G mobile communication systems; Bandpass filters; Defects; Microwave filters; Millimeter waves; Resonators; Substrate integrated waveguides; Topology; Waveguide filters; 3-D printing; Defected ground structure; Iris; Mm waves; Mm-wave application; Pass bands; Quasi-elliptic; Resonator filters; Spurious modes; Spurious suppressions; Defected ground structures","","","","","","","Basaligheh A., Saffari P., Boroujeni S.R., Filanovsky I., Moez K., A 28-30 GHz CMOS reflection-type phase shifter with full 360° phase shift range, IEEE Trans.

Unlike most recent researches which mainly focus on the manufacturing process and equipment, this paper reports the findings of experiments in which the self-developed flux-cored wire is used for arc additive manufacturing of alloy steel. It studies the effects of the contents of inclusions forming elements Ti and Mn on the microstructure and properties of wall parts, and discusses the microstructure evolution in the manufacturing process. It is discovered that the grain size of alloy steel parts manufactured by arc additive is affected by the number of heterogeneous nucleation cores dominated by inclusions in the molten pool, resulting in changed performance of the samples. During the manufacturing process, different sections of the samples experience different thermal cycles. The central region of the sample is heated and tempered, the microstructure change from granular bainite and acicular ferrite into tempered bainite and massive ferrite, and its hardness decrease. Furthermore, the electron backscatter diffraction analysis shows that the thermal cycle makes for the recrystallization in the middle region of the sample, but plasticity of the material does not change. The mechanical properties of the samples do not show obvious anisotropy with decrease in the grain size. Therefore, this study is of particularly significance in developing raw materials for arc additive manufacturing. © 2022, ASM International.","alloy steel; flux-cored wire; microstructure characterization; wire and arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Alloy steel; Ferrite; Grain size and shape; Microstructure; Nucleation; Particle size analysis; Steel metallurgy; Additive manufacturing technology; Flux-cored wire; Grainsize; Inclusion particles; Manufacturing methods; Manufacturing process; Microstructure and properties; Microstructure characterization; Rapid-prototyping; Wire and arc additive manufacturing; Wire","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51904243, 51974243); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, (2019JZ-31); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education, (2019JQ-284)","The authors do appreciate the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51974243), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51904243), Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province (Grant No. 2019JZ-31) and Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Provincial Department (Grant No. 2019JQ-284) for their financial support to the study.

Of the processes comprising remanufacturing, the repair process poses the greatest challenge. Additive manufacturing (AM) is expected to bring innovation to the repair process of remanufacturing. Although, so far, the directed energy deposition (DED) type AM has been most frequently applied to remanufacturing and only a few studies applied powder bed fusion (PBF) type AM to remanufacturing, PBF demonstrates great potential for application in remanufacturing. This study aims to assess the feasibility of the application of PBF to remanufacturing. We conducted an experimental PBF-based repair and attempted to identify its challenges. In the experiment, 1) we used AlSi10Mg powder, 2) we first fabricated a 5 mm square cube sample by using PBF, 3) we next removed 0.4 mm of thickness from the sample with milling, 4) then we restored 0.44 mm of thickness using PBF, and 5) we observed the restored sample. The observation showed that: 1) misalignment in the restoration occurred, 2) keyhole defects and gas pores were found more in the boundary area between the original and restored parts, and 3) the microstructures showed polycrystals in the restored part. These factors impaired the quality and reliability of PBF-based repair and present challenges of enhancing the feasibility of applying PBF-based repair to remanufacturing. This study also examined the whole process of PBFbased remanufacturing, which includes not only the repair process but also the processes of component inspection, process design, pre-repair process, and postrepair process, and discussed the challenges in these processes. The challenges include the development of repair process design methods, supportless fabrication processes, and non-destructive test (NDT) techniques. © Fuji Technology Press Ltd.","metal-based additive manufacturing; microstructure; parts reliability; powder bed fusion; remanufacturing","3D printers; Nondestructive examination; Powder metals; Restoration; Directed energy; Industrial processs; Manufacturing IS; Metal-based additive manufacturing; Part reliability; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion; Remanufacturing; Repair process; Used product; Microstructure","","","","","","","Giutini R., Gaudette K., Remanufacturing: the next great opportunity for boosting US productivity, Bus.

Box 127788, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","The interior surface of a fluidic oscillator produced by FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling)-based additive manufacturing is associated with a directional pattern corresponding to the 3D printing raster angle. The present research explores the impact of raster angle α=0, 45, and 90° from three commercial 3D printers versus a CNC machined oscillator. The surface is characterized using an optical 3D measurement system. The performance of the emanated jet is assessed using hot-wire anemometry downstream of the outlet nozzle, and the required supply pressure is measured at the actuator inlet. Printer P1 with an actuator average roughness S̄a=8.3 μm and printer P2 with S̄a=29.9 μm inherit clear raster patterns while actuators printed by printer P3, more economical compared to printer P1, do not exhibit an evident pattern related to raster angle with S̄a=17.7 μm. Regardless of the type of printer and associated surface texture, oscillators with 0° raster angle provoke higher jet spreading accompanied by a lower required supply pressure compared to the milled sample. Strikingly, the performance for P30 and P390 is noticeably superior to the other printed oscillators and surpasses the milled actuator in terms of jet switching quality. Power-law fit is depicted to estimate the jet spreading versus surface roughness for each raster angle. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; Fluidic oscillator; Fused Deposition Modeling; Raster angle; Surface texture; Sweeping jet actuator","Additives; Deposition; Fused Deposition Modeling; Layered manufacturing; Printing presses; Surface roughness; Textures; Fluidic oscillators; Interior surfaces; Jet actuators; Manufacturing IS; Model-based OPC; Performance; Raster angle; Supply pressure; Surface textures; Sweeping jet actuator; Actuators","","","","","Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research, KU, (CIRA-2019-025)","This publication is based upon work supported by the Khalifa University of Science and Technology under Award No. CIRA-2019-025 .

As a promising metal additive manufacturing technology, Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) technology brings possibilities for the combination of dissimilar metals. In this study, a gradient SS316L/IN625 joint with a composition ranging from 100% SS316L to 100% IN625 alloy was successfully prepared using LENS. The compositions, microstructures of each layer, and the interfaces between every two layers of the SS316L/IN625 joint were investigated. The results showed that the microstructure and elements were uniformly distributed along the deposition direction. No second phase or crack was detected in each layer or interface was observed in the SS316L/IN625 joint. The microhardness increased from 198 to 265 HV with increasing the content of IN625. The SS316L/IN625 joint showed a tensile strength of 672 MPa and a yield strength of 486 MPa. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","316L stainless steel; Crack-free additive manufacturing; Dissimilar metal joint; Inconel 625; Laser Engineered Net Shaping","3D printers; Additives; Microstructure; Tensile strength; 316 L stainless steel; Additive manufacturing technology; Adjustability; Crack free; Crack-free additive manufacturing; Dissimilar metal joints; Inconel 625; Joint strength; Laser engineered net shaping; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Austenitic stainless steel","","","","","Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research, (2021B0301030001); National Key Laboratory Foundation of Science and Technology on Materials, (6142902210109); Space Utilization System of China Manned Space Engineering, (KJZ-YY-WCL03); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51472188, 51521001); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities of the Central South University; Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project, (B13035); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project","This work is supported by the Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research (2021B0301030001), Project supported by the Space Utilization System of China Manned Space Engineering (KJZ-YY-WCL03), National Key Laboratory Foundation of Science and Technology on Materials under Shock and Impact (6142902210109), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51472188, and 51521001), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China and the “111” project (No. B13035).","Loh G.H., Pei E., Harrison D., Monzon M.D., An overview of functionally graded additive manufacturing, Addit.

A conformal cooling channel (CCC) is one application that is gaining traction in many vital industries, including mold production, aerospace, healthcare, automotive, and electronics. In this study, the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) based AM approach is utilized experimentally and numerically to incorporate a CCC network to improve the performance of a weld joint of 316 L SS plates. The study demonstrates a substantial improvement in welding performance by expediting heat dissipation during the TIG welding process using a specifically constructed CCC network on weld plates. Furthermore, CCC-based computational models reported better hardness around the weld joint and lowered residual stress levels. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","316 L; Additive manufacturing;

However, in comparison with the conventional fabrication technologies, the SiC ceramics produced by VPP technology have insufficient strengths or relatively larger shrinkage rates to meet the requirements of practical applications. Herein, we develop a novel bimodal SiC material recipe for VPP technology and prepare Si/SiC composites by the consequent liquid silicon infiltration (LSI) method. The addition of fine SiC particles improves the material's mechanical properties significantly. The final products possess low shrinkage rates (3.52 ± 0.26% in the x-direction, 3.73 ± 0.39% in the y-direction, and 4.69 ± 0.35% in the z-direction) as well as high flexural strength (363.23 ± 14.21 MPa) and low open porosity of 0.097%. The material compositions and fabrication strategies proposed in this work demonstrate an efficient way for the additive manufacturing of high-precision complex Si/SiC ceramic parts (e.g. lightweight space mirrors and structural ceramic parts). © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Liquid silicon infiltration; Low shrinkage rate; Si/SiC composite; Strength; Vat photopolymerization","Ceramic materials; Fabrication; Liquids; Shrinkage; Silicon carbide; High-precision; Liquid silicon infiltration; Low shrinkage; Low shrinkage rate; Photo polymerization; Shrinkage rates; Si/silicon carbide composite; Silicon carbide composites; Strength; Vat photopolymerization; Photopolymerization","","","","","Innovative and Entrepreneurial Talent Program of Jiangsu Province, (JSSCRC2021531); Government of Jiangsu Province, (JSSCBS20210836)","We acknowledge funding from the Innovative and Entrepreneurial Talent Program of Jiangsu Province (Grant No. JSSCRC2021531 ) and the Innovative and Entrepreneurial PhD Program of Jiangsu Province (Grant No. JSSCBS20210836 ) for supporting this work.","Garoli D., De Marcos L.V.R., Larruquert J.I., Corso A.J., Zaccaria R.P., Pelizzo M.G., Mirrors for space telescopes: degradation issues, Appl.

Additive manufacturing of thin-walled gas-tight structures with complex shapes can fulfil requirements for a wide range of applications, such as process equipment for the chemical industry. The requirement to be gas-tight makes the manufacturing process very fault-sensitive as even a single open pore in the submicron range can lead to an impermissible leak of hazardous gases. Further, it has always been a challenge to make thin walls using Laser Powder Bed Fusion of Metals (PBF-LB/M). We explore the key design limit of inclined overhanging gas-tight thin walls made from 316l. A double pass scan strategy is presented to realize these structures along with guidelines to be followed when attempting to print these structures. The paper reports the common failure modes where leaks occur and lessons learned to successful design and printing of gas-tight walls. The results show that fabrication of gas-tight walls is feasible even for a 30° inclination angle to the horizontal and wall thicknesses in the range of 200–300 µm. A case study shows the successful the application of the findings to the production of modular distillation devices. © 2022 The Authors","Effects of defects; Gas-tight; Laser powder bed fusion; Leak detection; Thin walls; Water-tight","3D printers; Chemical equipment; Chemical industry; Gases; Leak detection; Powder metals; Thin walled structures; Effect of defect; Gas-tight; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Leaks detections; Powder bed; Thin walls; Thin-walled; Water tight; Zero defects; Additives","","","","","IMVT; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, KIT; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (SFB 1441 – Project-ID 42688809 0)","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank Cornelia Schorle from IMVT (KIT) for conducting the He-leak tests, Florian Messerschmidt from IMVT (KIT) for conducting the SEM images, Manuel Hofheinz und Fabian Rupp IMVT (KIT) for machining the samples and assistance with the PBF-LB/M machine.

How the powder affects the L-PBF process is the basic mechanism determining the accurate prediction of the melt pool and the temperatures in finite element heat transfer simulations. The laser is treated as electromagnetic wave essentially and the powder particles can be heated by the formation of the inducted current on the particle surfaces. The laser energy density absorbed by the powder particles was calculated based on the laser-particle interaction. Based on the statistical analysis of particles in spatial distribution, the new volumetric heat source model was obtained and then applied to finite element heat transfer simulations. Results indicate that the temperature rise of the individual particle is not uniform and relates to the distribution of electromagnetic energy density on the surface of particles. The distribution of electromagnetic energy density on the surface of the individual particle at different positions is different. The energy absorbed by the upper particles is mainly determined by the direct irradiation of the laser. The energy absorbed by the bottom particles is mainly caused by the laser reflections. Due to the change of the mechanism for energy absorption, the maximum energy absorption occurs at the location which is near the average diameter away from the top surface of the powder bed. When the powder bed thickness is small, the laser energy density along build direction is in Gaussian distribution. With the increase of the powder bed thickness, the laser energy density distribution along build direction can be fit for 4-order polynomial function. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Electromagnetic wave; Heat source model; Laser powder bed fusion; Powder bed","Additives; Circular waveguides; Electromagnetic waves; Energy absorption; Finite element method; Heat transfer; Particle interactions; Heat source models; Heat transfer simulation; Individual particles; Laser energy density; Laser particle interactions; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; Powder particles; 3D printers","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11572074); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province, (2019-KF-05-07); Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 11572074 ) and Liaoning Provincial Natural Science Foundation ( 2019-KF-05-07 ).","Martin J.H., Yahata B.D., Hundley J.M., Mayer J.A., Schaedler T.A., Pollock T.M., 3D printing of high-strength aluminium alloys, Nature, 549, 7672, pp. 365-369, (2017); Li J.-Q., Fan T.-H., Taniguchi T., Zhang B.I., Phase-field modeling on laser melting of a metallic powder, Int.

Thus, in this study, SLM was used to prepare CuCrZr alloys, and their structure, electrical conductivity, and mechanical properties were analyzed. Moreover, effect of aging treatment on the alloy structure was investigated. With the laser power of 400 W, scanning speed of 300 mm/s, and scanning distance of 80 μm, an CuCrZr alloy sample with a maximum relative density of 99.15% and elongation of 71.7% was obtained by SLM. After direct age hardening (DAH) at 480 °C for 2 h, the conductivity and strength of the alloy increased significantly. In particular, the conductivity increased from 22.16%IACS to 72.8%IACS, indicating an overall increase of 228.5%. Meanwhile, the strength increased from 265.5 to 612.0 MPa. From the backscatter diffraction analysis, the small-angle grain boundaries increased after aging, and the crystal orientation changed from <101> to <111>. During direct aging, a large amount of nanoscale Cr phase was precipitated from the supersaturated solid solution, which increased the strength of the alloy. Further, precipitation strengthening was determined to be the main alloy strengthening mechanism.

Four build orientations - horizontal, vertical, flat, and diagonal - are assessed. A Kolsky pressure bar apparatus along with ultrahigh speed photography is used to carry out the dynamic fracture experiments. In-plane surface displacements near cracks are measured using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) to evaluate the fracture parameters directly. A hybrid experimental-numerical approach that combines DIC measurements and finite element analysis is implemented to extract critical energy release rate and crack growth resistance behaviors. The effect of build orientation is found to be significant on the quasi-static fracture behavior with the horizontal and flat orientations having the best and worst fracture responses, respectively. Under dynamic loading conditions, however, the effects of build orientation are marginal. Both AlF357 and AlSi10Mg show strain-rate sensitivity and change in fracture mechanism under dynamic loading conditions with ~175% and ~200% increase in critical energy release rate. AlF357 consistently outperforms AlSi10Mg in both quasi-static (~30%) and dynamic (~10%) loading conditions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Aluminum alloys; Digital Image Correlation; Fracture mechanics; High strain-rate behavior; Laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF/LB-PBF)","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Cracks; Dynamic loads; Dynamics; Energy release rate; Fracture; High speed photography; Strain measurement; Strain rate; Digital image correlations; Fractures mechanics; Fusion lasers; High strain-rate behavior; High-strain-rate; Laser powders; Laser-powder bed fusion (laser-powder bed fusion/LB-PBF); Powder bed; Rate behavior; Image correlation","","","","","","","Murr L.E., Frontiers of 3D printing/additive manufacturing: from human organs to aircraft fabrication†, J.

Accordingly, this work investigates the relation between the sintering and the issues appearing during pre-heating (e.g., smoking or excessive sintering) in EBM of highly susceptible-to-smoke Nickel-Titanium (NiTi) powder. First, the EB spot size was assessed depending on different focus offsets and beam currents from beam tracking experiments on a ceramic-coated stainless steel plate. Afterwards, the smoke tests were carried out at different focus offsets and beam currents in terms of beam speeds. It is shown that a smaller EB spot can effectively prevents smoking by enhancing the sintering degree. However, since this high sintering degree can cause strong powder bonding preventing the powder recycling, less focused beam (or larger EB spot) was selected to reach medium but efficient sintering in the level of around 30 %. Moreover, due to the influence of the diverging angle on the EB-material interaction, it is found that the negative defocused EB mitigates the smoke phenomenon compared to the positive defocused EB with a similar spot size. Based on the smoke test results, linked to the sintering degree, the processing windows for pre-heating NiTi powder are developed demonstrating three different modes: smoke-heating, melting-heating and healthy-heating. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing;

It has the advantage of flexibility in product design, such that various mechanical parts can be fabricated. However, because metal parts are built-up in a layer-by-layer manner, the material fabricated by LPBF has an anisotropic microstructure, which is important for the design of materials. In this study, the corrosion resistance of 18Ni300 maraging steel (MS) fabricated by LPBF was explored considering the building direction. Furthermore, the effects of heat treatment and aging on the microstructure and corrosion resistance were investigated. Sub-grain cells formed by rapid cooling in LPBF improve the corrosion resistance of MS. As a result, the as-built MS has the highest corrosion resistance. However, the sub-grain cells are eliminated by heat treatment or aging, which causes the deterioration of corrosion resistance. In the case of 18Ni300 MS, the cylindrical sub-grain cells are formed and aligned along the heat dissipation direction, which is similar to the building direction; thus, a significant anisotropy in corrosion resistance is found in the as-built MS. However, such anisotropy in corrosion resistance is diminished by heat treatment and aging, which eliminates the sub-grain cells. © 2022 by the authors.","anisotropy; corrosion behavior; laser powder bed fusion; maraging steel; post heat treatment","Anisotropy; Cells; Corrosion resistance; Corrosive effects; Cytology; Deterioration; Heat resistance; Maraging steel; Microstructure; Product design; Cell-be; Cell/B.E; Cell/BE; Corrosion behaviour; Heat treatment conditions; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Post heat-treatment; Post-heat treatment; Powder bed; Steel corrosion","","","","","Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE","This work was supported by the Global Major Manufacturing Industry Quality Response Ppuri Technology Development Program (Grant No. 20016459, Development of low-temperature carburizing mass-production system and process for GDI high-pressure injector parts with 15 years/300,000 km durability-cycle) funded By the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE, Republic of Korea).","Ngo T.D., Kashani A., Imbalzano G., Nguyen K.T.Q., Hui D., Additive manufacturing (3D printing): A review of materials, methods, applications and challenges, Compos.

The sloped-laminated object manufacturing (S-LOM) method can manufacture free-form formwork rapidly and cost-effectively. However, the S-LOM method has low precision due to the cutting error. This study proposes the slope-optimized laser cutting (SOLC), which can reduce the cutting error by optimizing the cutting conditions depending on cutting angle change. A case study was conducted to verify the precision improvement of the SOLC, and the results showed that the SOLC reduced the maximum error by 35.79%, average error by 35.42%, and standard deviation by 33.21%, compared to the existing cutting method. However, the SOLC is less efficient in reducing errors when the cutting angle is large, and it cannot be applied to various material conditions. In future studies, more detailed experiments on various material conditions and cutting angles should be conducted to improve the SOLC's precision. © 2022","Free-form formwork; Precision analysis; Slope-optimized laser cutting; Sloped-laminated object manufacturing; Three-dimensional printing","3D printers; Construction industry; Laminating; Laser beam cutting; Laser beams; Cutting angles; Formwork; Free-form formwork; Freeforms; Laminated object manufacturing; Laser cutting; Precision analysis; Slope-optimized laser cutting; Sloped-laminated object manufacturing; Three-dimensional-printing; Errors","","","","","Urban Architecture Research Program; Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, MOLIT, (21AUDP-B121595-06); Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, MOLIT; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (NRF-2021R1A5A1032433); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work was supported by the Urban Architecture Research Program funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of the Korean Government (No. 21AUDP-B121595-06 ).

In order to investigate the mechanical behaviors and failure modes of Ti6Al4V lattice structures manufactured by laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), five cell topologies such as face centered cubic with vertical struts (FCCZ), body centered cubic with vertical struts (BCCZ), face and body centered cubic with vertical struts (FBCCZ), diamond and rhombic dodecahedron (RD) were chosen. The compressive tests were performed. The deformation behaviors and failure modes of these five kinds of lattice samples were studied and compared. And stress–strain curves, the compressive strength, the elastic modulus, the specific compressive strength, and the specific energy absorption were calculated and compared. It is shown that the FBCCZ sample has the best performance on the elastic modulus and the compressive strength among these five topologies. The specific compressive strength and the specific energy absorption of the FCCZ sample are the highest, which are 131% and 116% higher than those of the diamond sample respectively. It is also found that the shear failure is the main failure mode of the FCCZ, BCCZ, FBCCZ, and RD samples. While, the diamond sample collapses layer by layer from the bottom layer to the top layer. Finite element analysis was performed and the numerical results can explain the damage evolution of all samples. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Compressive load; Failure mode; Lattice structure; Mechanical behavior","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Diamonds; Elastic moduli; Energy absorption; Failure (mechanical); Failure modes; Struts; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Topology; Additive manufacturing technology; Body-centred cubic; Compressive loads; Diamond samples; Face-centred cubic; Lattice structures; Mechanical behavior; Mechanical failures; Rhombic dodecahedron; Specific energy absorption; Compressive strength","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12032018, 1217021281, 52061135101, 91860128); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant No. 91860128 , No. 52061135101 , No. 12032018 and No. 1217021281 .","Deng F., Nguyen Q.-K., Zhang P., Multifunctional liquid metal lattice materials through hybrid design and manufacturing, Addit.

Targeted chemical treatment allowed the study of variation in surface quality with material removal depth. Characterization of surface and defect morphologies were made, comparing two chemical post-processing methods, Hirtisation® and chemical milling with different milling depths. Surface topography was characterized using white light interferometry and subsurface defect distribution was studied using X-ray computed tomography (XCT). The morphology of the surface at different milling depths was compared to the sub-surface information from XCT scans of the as-built material. Furthermore, Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) treated material was documented for comparison. Results show that post-processed surfaces contain a number of different defects of mixed morphology, position and origin. Post-processing deteriorates the surface quality with increased removal depth due to the presence of sub-surface defects. The position of sub-surface defects in relation to the material surface coincides with the depth at which contour-hatch interactions are likely to have occurred during the EBM building process. The distribution of this sub-surface defect population is anisotropic in the building (horizontal) plane and reasons for this are explored. Hirtisation® produces surfaces morphologically different from chemically milled surfaces. This difference was found to contribute to Hirtisation® producing surfaces with higher roughness (Sa) than chemically milled surfaces at comparable removal depth. HIP did remove all detectable sub-surface defects but microstructural artefacts indicating healed porosity were found. © 2022 The Authors","Chemical post-processing; Defects; Electron beam melting; Surface roughness; X-ray computed tomography","3D printers; Aluminum alloys; Computerized tomography; Electron beam melting; Electron beams; Milling (machining); Processing; Sintering; Surface defects; Surface roughness; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Topography; Chemical post-processing; Effect of chemicals; Electron-beam melting; Hot-isostatic pressings; Milled surfaces; Milling depth; Post-processing; Removal depth; Subsurface defect; X-ray computed tomography; Hot isostatic pressing","","","","","GKN Aerospace Sweden AB; NFFP7, (2017–04846); VINNOVA; seventh Swedish national aeronautics research programme","This work was supported by GKN Aerospace Sweden AB and VINNOVA through the seventh Swedish national aeronautics research programme (NFFP7) , Grant No. 2017–04846 .

Sufficient control of this laser-based additive manufacturing process is necessary to achieve a reliable development as well as reproducible part properties. Besides adjusting the standard process parameters, such as the laser power or the scanning speed, the process gas is an important parameter that influences the part characteristics. In addition to the inertization of the atmosphere, process by-products can be removed during the manufacturing with a constant gas flow across the build plate. Typically, argon or nitrogen is applied. This study investigated the effects of various argon-helium mixtures in comparison to pure argon gas on the heat balance of process by-products during the processing of a high-strength aluminum alloy by means of Schlieren imaging. The method enables visualizations of the process by-products and is further capable of studying evaporation phenomena. For this purpose, a Schlieren imaging setup was designed and installed in an AconityMINI machine. The experimental results were exploited to validate a simplified heat transfer model introduced in this work. The results indicate that the addition of helium to the process gas lowers the amount of fumes and incandescent spatters and thus could decrease evaporation. Also, it was found that the higher thermal conductivity of helium compared to argon leads to significantly higher cooling of process by-products.  © 2022 Author(s).","","Aluminum alloys; Argon; Evaporation; Flow of gases; Heat transfer; High strength alloys; Image processing; Laser beams; Powder metals; Additive manufacturing process; Complex parts; Laser power; Laser-based additive manufacturing; Powder bed; Process gas; Process parameters; Property; Schlieren imaging; Standards process; Helium","","","","","Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Wirtschaft, Infrastruktur, Verkehr und Technologie, StMWi, (NW-1901-0013)","The authors would like to express their sincere thanks to the research project “GasAlloy-X” funded by the program “Neue Werkstoffe” from the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs, Regional Development and Energy (No. NW-1901-0013).

In this research, the inclination angle, shape and size of channel were compared on the complex products produced by SLM. Besides, the surface quality and forming difficulty of AlSi10Mg were investigated. As shown by the results, the overhang length played a key role in collapse, which was determined by inclination angle. In addition, the limited inclination angle was attributed to the position relationship between the inclination plane and the moving direction of the scraper. Meanwhile, the ridge-shaped flow channels had an advantage on surface quality and dimensional accuracy over the circular channel. No matter whether the section of the flow channels is circular or ridge-shaped, the size of the flow channels should be designed equal or >2 mm. The complex product with flow channels had been successfully produced by SLM without remaining powder or defects, which could withstand 2 MPa for 5 min. Furthermore, the CT test is suitable to investigate the forming quality of the flow channels, especially whether there is remaining powder inside the flow channels. Especially for the complex product with flow channels, it provides an integrated detection method based on X ray test and CT test for remaining powder, internal surface quality or internal defects. In addition, the design idea and criteria of three-dimensional flow channels based on the SLM technology provide a basis for the design of other products with flow channels. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Flow channels; Inclination plane; Selective laser melting","Channel flow; Melting; Product design; Selective laser melting; Circular channels; Complex products; Design and manufactures; Dimensional accuracy; Flow channels; Inclination angles; Inclination plane; Moving direction; Selective laser melting; Shape and size; Surface properties","","","","","China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, CASC, (GXGY-2020-07); China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, CASC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFB1103000); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of National Key Research and Development Program of China grants 2017YFB1103000 and Common Process Research Project of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation GXGY-2020-07 .","Laguna O., Lietor P., Godino F., Corpas-Iglesias F., A review on additive manufacturing and materials for catalytic applications: milestones, key concepts, advances and perspectives, Mater.

This study documents an approach for developing LPBF solidification mode selection process map based on an analytical equation model which determines the solidification mode transition criteria as a function of laser power (P), scan velocity (V) and material properties. As case studies, solidification mode selection process maps were developed for three Ti6Al4V-xB alloys (x = 1, 2, 5 wt% B), presenting primary β, primary TiB, and coupled eutectic solidification modes. To validate the proposed approach, laser deposition experiments were conducted to fabricate single-tracks, single-layer and two-layer pads on arc-melted Ti6Al4V-xB alloy buttons with different P-V parameters. The model-developed process maps agreed with the experimental results. P-V windows were found to allow coupled-eutectic solidification for off-eutectic Ti6Al4V-1, 2, 5 % B and primary-β solidification for hyper-eutectic Ti6Al4V-5 %B, producing a microstructure with a continuous TiB network and a microstructure with a discontinuous network of nano-scale TiB whiskers respectively. Single-layer and two-layer pads showed consistent microstructure features of the tracks, except for the narrow region that was remelted during pad deposition. Melt pool hardness was measured, which increases with scan velocity and shows a sudden change when solidification mode was altered. The potential and limitations of the proposed method for LPBF microstructure investigation are discussed. © 2022 The Authors","Boron; Coupled eutectic solidification; Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF); Microstructure engineering; Ti6Al4V","3D printers; Additives; Boron; Deposition; Eutectics; Microstructure; Nanotechnology; Solidification; Titanium alloys; Coupled eutectic solidification; Eutectic solidification; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Microstructure engineering; Mode selection; Powder bed; Process maps; Scan velocity; Solidification mode; Aluminum alloys","","","","","NextManufacturing Center; Carnegie Mellon University, CMU","The authors thank the NextManufacturing Center, the Manufacturing Futures Initiative at Carnegie Mellon University for its financial support.","Frazier W.E., Metal additive manufacturing: a review, J.

The selection of the appropriate process variables plays a fundamental part in the microstructure and in the determination of the final mechanical and corrosion properties. The main purpose of this study is to analyze the corrosion behavior, hardness and microstructure of 17–4 PH SS manufactured by SLM in comparison to the commercial counterparts. The anisotropic behavior was investigated by analyzing the microstructure–hardness and corrosion interrelationship, both in the surface of the construction platform and in the growth direction of the element. The corrosion behavior of the SLM 17–4PH SS in its natural state was investigated in relation to that of the 17–4 PH SS heat treated in a 0.1 M NaCl + 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, using three electrochemical techniques. The results confirmed that the corrosion resistance of SLM 17–4 PH SS was considerably better than that of the forging, even after 60 days of immersion in the test solution. This was attributed to the absence of important manufacturing defects, to the fine microstructure with an important amount of austenite produced by SLM, and to a small amount of non-metallic inclusions precipitated as a result of the fast cooling and the high speed of solidification associated with the SLM process.

A novel MMDoD mechanism is designed and developed using a magnetostrictive actuator to achieve a desktop-based metal AM system using a low input voltage circuit. The MMDoD mechanism further includes the use of a thermally insulating piston to protect the actuator from the heat of the molten metal pool. The oscillation of the piston in the MMDoD mechanism is used to generate the molten metal droplets. To generate reproducible molten metal droplets with the least geometrical variations, the effect of the input signal pulse shape, the input signal voltage amplitude, and stand-off distance between piston and nozzle entrance on the MMDoD mechanism performance is studied using high-speed videography. The input signal pulse shape is selected to be either the unfiltered signal (UFS) and low pass filtered signal (LPFS). Using UFS and LPFS, a parametric study of molten metal droplets size and its variation is conducted by varying the stand-off distance between the piston and nozzle and input signal voltage amplitude across the magnetostrictive actuator. To demonstrate the metal additive manufacturing using this system, a study is conducted to find the optimal gap between each droplet. Using the MMDoD system, molten metal droplets of uniform shape (571 μm) are ejected at fixed generation rate and deposited with an optimal gap to print conductive traces on a polymer substrate. As these conductive lines were printed using metal on polymer substrate, they could provide a new way to connect the electronic components to achieve AM of the electronic circuits. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Droplet-on-demand;

However, the biological inertness and poor corrosion resistance of SLM-NiTi alloy limit their wide application as biomedical implant materials. In this study, polycaprolactone (PCL) coating was prepared on SLM-NiTi alloy by dipping and pulling method, and the effects of alkali heat pretreatment on the morphology, adhesion, corrosion resistance, long-term stability and biomineralisation of the PCL coatings were investigated. The results showed that PCL coating can substantially improve the performance of SLM-NiTi alloy, and the PCL coating after alkali heat pretreatment has higher adhesion (increased from 1,747 to 2,498 mN) and lower corrosion current density (reduced by about an order of magnitude compared to PCL coating alone). In addition, the necessary stability, biomineralisation and biocompatibility ability of coatings were also further improved. Therefore, the alkali heat pretreated PCL-coated SLM-NiTi alloy has good application prospects in implants due to its superior properties. © 2022 The Authors.

The use of simulation methods also requires more time support and higher hardware requirements. In this paper, a three-dimensional transient heat transfer model and a neural network optimization process parameter model in the process of preparing copper alloys by SLM are developed by combining finite element simulation methods with neural network prediction. The thermal behavior of the multitrack molten pools was investigated by ANSYS APDL, and the effects of different laser powers and scanning speeds on the temperature field and structure dimensions of the molten pools were discussed. The results show that the current single-Track has a significant preheating effect on the unmachined single-Track and a reheating effect on the machined single-Track during the multitrack forming process. The laser power and scanning speed can be controlled to regulate the temperature, 3D size, and heat spread area of the molten pool to avoid over-melting and under-melting. The accuracy of the temperature field model was verified by single-Track experiments. A neural network prediction model was constructed to predict the maximum temperature and size of the molten pool by optimizing the backpropagation neural network with a genetic algorithm, providing a methodological guide for the study of SLM process parameters. © 2022 Author(s).","","Copper alloys; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Heat transfer; Neural networks; Selective laser melting; Temperature; Experimental approaches; Laser melting process; Laser power; Laser scanning; Molten pool; Optimal process; Process parameters; Scanning speed; Selective laser melting; Single-tracks; Melting","","","","","","","Tan J.L., Tang C., Wong C.H., Study and modeling of melt pool evolution in selective laser melting process of SS316L, MRS Commun., 8, pp. 1178-1183, (2018); Chen Z., Zong X., Shi J., Zhang X., Online monitoring based on temperature field features and prediction model for selective laser sintering process, Appl.

This issue results in poor mechanical properties and strong mechanical anisotropy of FDM-printed parts. Moreover, this is more critical for FDM-printed parts made of fiber-reinforced composite materials. In this study, an innovative FDM 3D printer with a rotary print head was developed to enhance the tensile strength of parts fabricated from short carbon fiber (CF)-reinforced polylactic acid (PLA) composites. The rotary speed of the print head was a dominant parameter affecting the tensile properties of the parts. The optimal rotary speed was at 200 rpm at a raster angle of 0°, which offered a 1.5-fold enhancement in the tensile strength and 6-fold reduction in anisotropy. In addition, a rotary speed of 200 rpm caused greater entanglement of the polymer chains, whereas increasing the speed to 300 and 400 rpm led to less entanglement. Notably, the rotary shear field provides “in situ” regulation of microstructure formation during the 3D printing process. The results of this study can be useful in enhancing the mechanical strength and reliability of industrially manufactured FDM parts. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Carbon fibers; FDM; Polylactide; Polymer-matrix composites (PMCs); Rotary shear field","Anisotropy; Carbon fibers; Deposition; Fabrication; Fiber reinforced plastics; Laminated composites; Layered manufacturing; Polyesters; Polymer matrix composites; Printing presses; Shear flow; Speed; Tensile strength; Carbon-fiber reinforced plastic composites; Interlayer bonding; Interlayer bonds; Key Issues; Poly lactide; Polymer-matrix composite; Print head; Rotary shear field; Rotary speed; Shear fields; Fused Deposition Modeling","","","","","Chongqing Key Laboratory of Soft-Matter Material Chemistry and Function Manufacturing; Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, YIPA CAS; Venture and Innovation Support Program for Chongqing Overseas Returnees","This work was supported by the Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences , the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) “Light of West China”, Venture & Innovation Support Program for Chongqing Overseas Returnees , and Chongqing Key Laboratory of Soft-Matter Material Chemistry and Function Manufacturing .

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the cross-head speed on the mechanical properties of acrylate and methacrylate-based oligomer/monomer materials of the specimens produced by Stereolithography (SLA) printer. The characteristic mechanical properties of materials, such as modulus of elasticity, Poisson's ratio, and the ultimate strength depending on low strain rate levels were explored. The fractured surfaces of the tensile test specimens were examined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Based on the experimental results, it is concluded the mechanical properties of the photosensitive resins are quite sensitive to the tensile test speeds.  © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","acrylate and methacrylate; cross-head speed; mechanical properties; SLA printing; stereolithographic elastomer","Crosslinking; Elastomers; Light sensitive materials; Materials properties; Photosensitivity; Resins; Stereolithography; Strain rate; Tensile testing; Acrylate and methacrylate; Crosshead speed; Engineering materials; Mechanical properties of materials; Photosensitive resins; Stereolithographic elastomer; Stereolithography printing; Strain-rates; Three-dimensional-printing; Ultimate strength; Scanning electron microscopy","","","","","Dokuz Eylül Üniversitesi, (BAP-2021, KB.FEN.041); Dokuz Eylül Üniversitesi","Research funding: The authors acknowledge Dokuz Eylul University Department of Scientific Research Projects for the financial support through the project BAP-2021.KB.FEN.041.

The transfer to complex parts with various scan lengths can be achieved by adapting beam parameters such as beam power and scan speed. Under ideal conditions, this adaption results in a constant energy input into the powder bed despite of the local scan length. However, numerous PBF-EB machines show deviations from the ideal situation because the beam diameter is subject to significant changes if the beam power is changed. This study aims to demonstrate typical scaling issues when applying process parameters to scan lengths up to 45 mm using a fourth generation γ-TiAl alloy. Line energy, area energy, return time, and lateral velocity are kept constant during the additive manufacturing process by adjusting beam power and beam velocity to various scan lengths. Samples produced in this way are examined by light microscopy regarding lateral melt pool extension, melt pool depth, porosity, and microstructure. The process-induced aluminum evaporation is measured by electron probe microanalysis. The experiments reveal undesired changes in melt pool geometry, gas porosity, and aluminum evaporation by increasing the beam power. In detail, beam widening is identified as the reason for the change in melt pool dimensions and microstructure. This finding is supported by numerical calculations from a semi-analytic heat conduction model. This study demonstrates that in-depth knowledge of the electron beam diameter is required to thoroughly control the PBF-EB process, especially when scaling process parameters from simply shaped geometries to complex parts with various scan lengths. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; beam diameter; electron beam; electron beam powder bed fusion; evaporation; microstructure; titanium aluminide","","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (61375930—SFB 814)","The Chair of Materials Science and Engineering for Metals gratefully acknowledges the German Research Foundation—Project ID 61375930—SFB 814—“Additive Manufacturing” TP B02 for financial support.","Fu Z., Korner C., Actual state-of-the-art of electron beam powder bed fusion, Eur.

The applications of rigid planar parallel robotic manipulators are also significant because of their various desirable characteristics, such as lower inertia, higher payload, and high accuracy. However, rigid planar parallel robots are heavy and require different actuators and components. This study introduces a novel technique to produce a light three degrees of freedom soft parallel manipulator at a low cost, which can be stimulated easily. This technique allows researchers to customize the actuator’s design based on the requirement. The robot is made by 3D printing based on fused deposition modelling and a direct ink writing process. The design, development, and additive manufacturing of a soft parallel robot electrothermally driven by a linear silicon-based actuator and polylactic acid parts are presented. Silicon-based soft actuators replace the rigid conventional linear actuators in this study to drive the planar parallel manipulator. The actuation of actuators is conducted using simple heating compared to the conventional rigid actuator. Various heating approaches and configurations are compared and analysed to find the most suitable one for the effective linear stroke of the soft actuator. The finite element model is used to analyse the performance of the electrothermally silicon-ethanol soft actuators in ABAQUS. The kinematics of the planar parallel robotic manipulator are simulated in MATLAB to achieve its workspace. The final soft parallel robot mechanism and the active and passive links are fabricated and tested experimentally. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.","3D printing; 4D printing; robotic materials; silicon; soft parallel robots","ABAQUS; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Flexible manipulators; Linear actuators; Machine design; Robots; Silicon; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; 4d printing; Parallel robotics; Parallel robots; Robotic manipulators; Robotic material; Silicon-based; Soft actuators; Soft parallel robot; 3D printers","","","","","","","Gul J Z, Et al., 3D printing for soft robotics-a review, Sci.

Although increasing laser power has been an effective way to break through this technical problem, studies regarding the high power LPBF (HP-LPBF) are still insufficient. Relying upon a self-developed 2000 W level HP-LPBF equipment, this paper investigated the defect characteristics, microstructure, and mechanical properties of 316L stainless steel (SS) LPBF samples fabricated at three different laser power levels (200 W, 1000 W, 2000 W). The results show that hot cracks extending along high angle grain boundaries may form at 1000 W and 2000 W. However, no crack is observed at 200 W. With the optimized process parameters, highly dense (relative density>99.5 %) samples can be obtained at all three laser powers. Moreover, the build rate of the dense sample increases monotonously with the increase of laser power, which are 5.76 cm3/h at 200 W, 36 cm3/h at 1000 W, and 61.2 cm3/h at 2000 W. The dominant grain structures of all the as-built samples are columnar grains growing along the build direction. With the increase of laser power, the columnar grains become coarser in size and higher in proportion, the 〈001〉 texture gets stronger, while the dislocation density decreases slightly. Although the Vickers hardness and room-temperature tensile properties of the LPBF samples fabricated at 1000 W and 2000 W are slightly lower than those of the samples fabricated at 200 W, they are significantly higher than those of 316L SS forgings (ASTM A182M-2016A). © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","316L SS; Build rate; Defect; High power laser powder bed fusion (HP-LPBF); Mechanical property; Microstructure","3D printers; Cracks; Grain boundaries; High power lasers; Powder metals; Textures; Vickers hardness; 316 L stainless steel; Build rate; Columnar grain; High power laser powder bed fusion; High-power lasers; Laser powders; Laser power; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Powder bed; Steel defect; Austenitic stainless steel","","","","","Huazhong University of Science and Technology, HUST, (2021XXJS029); Huazhong University of Science and Technology, HUST; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFB1103800); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Major Science and Technology Projects of China, (Y2019-VII-0011-0151); National Major Science and Technology Projects of China","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFB1103800 ), the National Science and Technology Major Project (Grant No. Y2019-VII-0011-0151 ), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, HUST (Grant No. 2021XXJS029 ).

In recent decades the use of advanced composite materials green manufacturing methods has increased the requirement to provide effective means of performing experimental investigations to support analytical and numerical analyses. The main objective of this article is to analyse the performance of additively manufactured (AM) Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) sample with FBG sensors under the influence of environmental factors (temperature, relative humidity). The sample was manufactured using continuous carbon fibre applying Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) technique. During the AM process one FBG sensor was embedded in the middle of the sample, while the second FBG sensor was attached to the finished sample surface. The environmental tests were conducted to investigate the durability of AM elements and influences of embedded FBG sensors on the composite specimen. Additionally, the behaviour of composite materials under environmental loading was modelled using the Finite Element Method (FEM) through an Abaqus software. It allows to achieve a more complex picture of embedded fibre optic influences on AM composite material durability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer; Fibre Bragg Grating sensor; Thermal strain","3D printers; ABAQUS; Bridge decks; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Durability; Electric sensing devices; Environmental testing; Fiber Bragg gratings; Numerical methods; Structural health monitoring; Advanced composite materials; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Composites material; Experimental and numerical studies; Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors; Green manufacturing; Health monitoring devices; Localised; Structural applications; Thermal strain; Additives","","","","","Narodowe Centrum Nauki, NCN, (2019/01/Y/ST8/00075); Narodowe Centrum Nauki, NCN","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the project ’Additive manufactured composite smart structures with embedded fibre Bragg grating sensors (AMCSS)’ funded by the National Science Centre, Poland under M-ERA.NET 2 Call 2019, grant agreement 2019/01/Y/ST8/00075 .

This task is of vital importance in fulfilling the low energy criteria under the policies to tackle energy shortage and climate change. According to the intelligent EC modeling in 3DP, the multisource data consists in three parts including pixel-source, motion-source, and processing-source. Compared with existing solutions, which either only harness the geometric characteristics of computer-aided design (CAD) models or simply integrate the processing parameters into the prediction, the proposed 3DPECP-Net is able to seamlessly fuse relevant data in 3DP, taking full advantage of the complementary information of diverse datasources for more accurate prediction. Specifically, the multisource fusion frame (MSFF) stacks multiple transformer blocks to catch global spatial information, and convolutional blocks to catch local feature details. Furthermore, we propose a continual attention memory network (CAMN) to ably extract and store the inter-layer consistency, enforcing to efficiently learn an exhaustive representation for 3DP EC prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted on an in-house dataset and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 3DPECP-Net achieves a superior prediction performance than state-of-the-art methods. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3DPECP-net; Additive manufacturing; Energy consumption; Inter-layer consistency; Multisource fusion","Additives; Climate change; Computer aided design; Energy utilization; Forecasting; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; 3DPECP-net; Energy-consumption; Intelligent models; Intelligent prediction; Inter-layer consistency; Inter-layers; Modelling and predictions; Multi-source fusion; 3D printers","","","","","Hong Kong Polytechnic University, PolyU, (1-ZE2Q); Innovation and Technology Fund, ITF, (MHP/014/20)","This research was supported by the Project of Strategic Importance in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (No. 1-ZE2Q), and Innovation and Technology Fund - Mainland-Hong Kong Joint Funding Scheme (No. MHP/014/20).

The focus of this research is to propose an efficient FDM-3D printing process utilising multiple filaments with no interruption of the process to ensure the multi-material electronic product achieved is structurally integrated. Such research is an attempt towards development of recyclable rigid electronic structures via multi-material 3D printing, i.e., multiple conductive nanomaterial embedded thermoplastic and non-conductive thermoplastic layers (in coil forms, herein). Six radio frequency identification (RFID) tag coil geometries were selected for the study. The thermoplastic polymer used in this research was polylactic acid (PLA), and the conductive filament was carbon black nanoparticle embedded PLA at approx. 21 wt.%. The nozzle and filaments diameters examined were 1.75 mm. A MakerBot Replicator 2X 3D printer was partially disassembled to be equipped with a dual head, for our examinations. The research investigated the major challenges ahead of the proposed development, mainly, on the deteriorating effects on the quality of the integrated product (structural integrity, electric and magnetic properties) induced by the 3D printing process parameters (e.g., temperature). The most efficient nozzle and bed temperatures to prevent visible defects were found to be higher than the supplier’s recommendation, attributed to the uncertainties associated with the multi-material composition, and were found to require 248 and 100 °C for reliable and continued FDM printing, respectively. The measurements on the electric and magnetic properties, using 4-wire resistance and Hall effect method, respectively, were conducted to quantify process induced deteriorating effects, quantitatively. It has been examined whether the multi-material electronic structure can be achieved via uninterrupted (continuous) processing of polymer nanocomposite-based identification systems for recyclability purpose whilst maintaining the electromagnetic properties of it, a promising technology for reducing landfill. Recommendations were identified for best practices behind such development. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing; carbon black; electrical conductivity; magnetic properties; nanocomposite; PLA; RFID","","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/R016828/1, EP/R513027/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC","The authors are grateful to the technical supports from Keith Pamment and Richard Leach at the School of Science and Technology at City, University of London for the experimental research.

This interest when it comes to NiTi-based shape memory alloys (SMA) has a third reason due to the poor machinability and need for several steps of additional treatments to create functional parts from these alloys. Generating the printability map and achieving fully dense parts is one of the priorities in AM communities, despite the aforementioned benefits of AM that open new doors for controlling the microstructure and thereby enhancing thermomechanical properties of additively manufactured components. Motivated by crystallographic texture-dependence of NiTi thermomechanical properties, a build orientation approach is utilized for controlling the crystallographic texture of LPBF-processed NiTi specimens. The microstructural and phase analyses of parts fabricated at varying angles show the significant effect of building orientation on the crystallographic texture of the as-printed samples. The mechanism of the effect of the proposed approach for controlling texture is discussed. SMA rotary actuator is a potential application of this methodology. We assessed the thermomechanical properties of the as-printed rod specimens under simple torsion using 3D digital image correlation (DIC) to capture the shear strain field. The recovery shear strains of the samples are then correlated to the crystallographic textures. It is shown that the recovery strain of the textured NiTi samples is in good agreement with the theoretical transformation strains obtained from lattice deformation theory. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF); Microstructure; Shape memory alloys; Texture control; Torsion","3D printers; Additives; Binary alloys; Image correlation; Lattice theory; Shape-memory alloy; Shear strain; Textures; Titanium alloys; Build orientation; Crystallographic textures; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; NiTi shape memory alloys; Powder bed; Texture behavior; Texture control; Thermomechanical properties; Torsional behaviors; Torsional stress","","","","","NSF I-Corps; Ohio Third Frontier Technology Validation and Start-up Fund; Glenn Research Center, GRC","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the Ohio Third Frontier Technology Validation and Start-up Fund , NSF I-Corps , and NASA Glenn Research Center .

As a typical difficult-to-machine material, it is extremely easy to cause grinding burns, surface scratches, and grinding wheel blockages during traditional grinding. In this work, we developed a super elastic composite abrasive tool (ECAT) based on the principle of liquid body armor and proposed a high-shear and low-pressure precision intelligent grinding method. The grinding experiments of selective laser melting (SLM)–fabricated Inconel718 workpiece was conducted to explore the grinding characteristics of ECAT using the precision intelligent grinding system. The optimal grinding parameters were explored. Under the optimal grinding parameters, the surface roughness of the SLM workpiece was reduced from 385.2 to 44.5 nm after 40 grinding strokes. The material removal rate was about 0.42 μm/min. The surface quality of the workpiece was significantly improved. In addition, the grinding force with different abrasive layers was investigated. It was found that the average ratio of the tangential force (Ft) to the normal force (Fn) of an abrasive layer with liquid-body-armor-like abrasive system is 0.427, which was much higher than that of 0.162 for pure high-performance fabrics (without liquid-body-armor-like abrasive system). The high-shear and low-pressure grinding characteristic of ECAT was verified. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Grinding force; High-shear and low-pressure grinding; SLM Inconel718 alloy; Super elastic composite abrasive tool; Surface quality","Aerospace industry; Alloys; Grinding (machining); Liquids; Surface roughness; Abrasive tools; Composite abrasives; Elastic composites; Grinding force; High shear; High-low; High-shear and low-pressure grinding; Inconel-718; Low pressures; Selective laser melting; Selective laser melting inconel718 alloy; Super elastic composite abrasive tool; Surface properties","","","","","Key Research and Development Project of Zibo City, (2019ZBXC070); Scientific Innovation Project for Young Scientists in Shandong Provincial Universities; Taishan Scholar Foundation of Shandong Province, (tsqn201812064); Key Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong, (2018GGX103008); Youth Innovation Technology Project of Higher School in Shandong Province, (2019KJB030); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, NNSF, NSF, NSFC, (51,905,322, 51875329); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, (ZR2017MEE050); Taishan Scholar Foundation of Shandong Province; Postdoctoral Research Foundation of China, (2021T140420); Shandong University of Technology and Zibo City Integration Development Project","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51875329 and 51,905,322), the China postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2021T140420), the Taishan Scholar Special Foundation of Shandong Province (No. tsqn201812064), the Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation (No. ZR2017MEE050), the Shandong Provincial Key Research and Development Project (No. 2018GGX103008), the Scientific Innovation Project for Young Scientists in Shandong Provincial Universities (No. 2019KJB030), and the Key Research and Development Project of Zibo City (No. 2019ZBXC070).

This technique can expand the potential applications of additive manufacturing and offer new solutions for the engineering design of hybrid parts. In this work, laser powder bed fusion was used to deposit MS1 maraging steel on a conventionally produced (cast and hot-rolled) 42SiCr martensitic steel base material. Despite the profoundly different chemical compositions and hardening behaviours of these materials, their yield and ultimate tensile strengths in solution-annealed and hardened conditions are quite similar. Various heat treatments were performed to optimise the mechanical properties of the resulting hybrid part. The highest yield strength of 1400 MPa and tensile strength of 1483 MPa was achieved with a post-processing heat treatment which consisted of annealing at 900 °C for 25 min followed by water quenching and subsequent very short tempering at 490 °C. In the tensile tests, all the hybrid parts, regardless of heat treatment parameters, fractured within the base material and neither in the joint nor in the adjacent heat-affected zone. The interface areas and the microstructures of both materials were documented in detail in the as-built state and also after the heat treatment. © 2022, The Author(s).","High strength steel; Hybrid part; Maraging steel; Powder bed fusion; Selective laser melting","Additives; Chromium alloys; Chromium steel; Hardening; Heat affected zone; High strength steel; Hot rolling; Interface states; Maraging steel; Martensitic stainless steel; Martensitic transformations; Melting; Silicon alloys; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Base material; Bimetallics; Engineering design; High-strength steels; Hybrid part; Laser powders; New solutions; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion; Selective laser melting; Selective laser melting","","","","","Ministerstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy, MŠMT","This contribution has been prepared within the project ITI CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/18_069/0010040, “Research of additive technologies for future application in mechanical engineering practice—RTI plus” under the auspices of the National Sustainability Programme I of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic aimed at supporting research, experimental development and innovation.

Impact energy absorption is one such area where advanced measures are being adopted to prevent any damage to the infrastructure from any impact caused by vehicles or other elements. Honeycomb structures have been primarily used in such high impact energy absorption applications. With the advent of modern additive manufacturing practices, drastic modifications to the simple honeycombs generally used are possible, thus expanding the reach and capability of these structures. In this article, in-plane uniaxial compression performance of hybrid and hierarchical hexagonal honeycombs has been studied in the context of strain energy absorption for in-plane impact such as the case of vehicle collision to the pillars of flyover or bridges. The polylactic acid (PLA) filament has been used to manufacture the honeycombs through fused deposition modeling (FDM) additive manufacturing technique. Simple hexagonal honeycombs have been studied first at low deformation speed to understand the deformation mechanics under uniaxial compression and its dependence on the unit cell dimensions and cell wall thickness. The effect of transition to the hybrid and hierarchical hexagonal honeycombs on the compression deformation has been highlighted next. While the hierarchical structures show better energy absorption capabilities and plateau stress, the hybrid hexagonal honeycombs show their high loadresistance.

This study investigates the effect of high strain rate on mechanical behavior, considering the fact that materials can be shown different mechanical properties under rapid straining compared to quasi-static loading. In addition, the role of polymerization as a determining factor in the final mechanical properties of the SLA parts is indicated. Regarding that, samples based on urethane dimethacrylate resin material were printed in different directions (θ = [0–90]) and post-treatment was performed with respect to the UV and UV with temperature. The effect of high strain rate was analyzed through a servo-hydraulic machine, monotonic, and interrupted tensile tests ranging from 0.3 to 117.4 s−1. Scanning electron microscopy was applied to analyze the failure surface characteristics. The results show the important effect of strain rate on mechanical properties such that by increasing the strain rate, yield stress and ultimate stress were increased. Furthermore, investigation of the strain rate sensitivity during the different steps of the failure indicates more sensitivity of the non-linear zone of the stress–strain curve with strain rate. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Additive manufacturing; High strain rate; Mechanical behavior; Polymers (durable resin); Stereolithography manufacturing","Additives; Fabrication; Resins; Stereolithography; Strain rate; Tensile testing; Yield stress; Build orientation; Durable resin; High-strain-rate; Mechanical behavior; Photocurable resins; Polymer (durable resin); Post-curing; Quasi-static; Stereolithography manufacturing; Strain-rates; Scanning electron microscopy","","","","","","","Ligon S.C., Liska R., Stampfl J., Gurr M., Mulhaupt R., Polymers for 3D printing and customized additive manufacturing, Chem Rev ACS Publications, 117, pp. 10212-10290, (2017); Zirak N., Shirinbayan M., Deligant M., Tcharkhtchi A., Toward polymeric and polymer composites impeller fabrication, Polymers (Basel).

The annealing of such specimens was carried out in a chamber furnace in a protective atmosphere of argon at a temperature of 1038 °C for 1 h. The cooling process was carried out in an atmosphere of air at ambient temperature. The microstructure of the IN 625 nickel superalloy after the 3D printing process and after the post-process heat treatment (HT) was examined by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The results showed a uniform microstructure after the SLM process with element microsegregation. The cooling rate in the heat treatment was not sufficient which caused precipitation at the grain boundaries, most probably carbides and resulted in only a partial increase in ductility much lower than that of the material in initial state despite the high temperature applied during the annealing. The strength in the HT was on a level comparable to as-build state, 852 MPa and 891 MPa, respectively. Additional corrosion resistance tests were performed by the potentiodynamic method in a 3.5% NaCl solution at room temperature. HT increased the current density variation from ipass due to the formed precipitates. Our studies show that the size effect is an important factor when assessing the properties of IN 625 obtained using SLM.

Ltd, 629656, Singapore","Metal powder bed fusion additive manufacturing (PBF-AM) has been widely adopted in the aerospace and orthopedic industries. As the feedstock, the condition of metal powders affects the quality of the PBF-AM part and contributes significantly to the overall cost. However, it is not feasible to adopt virgin powder for every single build. Therefore, reusing the powder feedstock in subsequent builds becomes an economical method to reduce manufacturing costs. However, there is no standard for reusing powder, whose quality may change with increasing reuses and in turn deteriorate the PBF-AM part's quality. Herein, we evaluate the reusability of Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb intermetallic powder in electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF) process up to 15 times (∼300 h in total cumulative build time). The powder characteristics, chemical compositions, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the EB-PBF parts are evaluated to understand the mechanisms of powder quality changes. We found that Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb powder can be reused up to 15 times without compromising the resultant microstructure and mechanical properties. However, contaminations are unavoidable and their formation mechanisms are revealed here. These findings provide an in-depth understanding of the process-powder-microstructure relationship in additively manufactured Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb intermetallic and can be applied to other alloys with volatile elements (such as Al, Mg, Zn, Pb, Mn). Further, these mechanisms underlying powder reusability are universal for all materials involved in the EB-PBF process. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Mechanical properties; Powder characteristics; Reuse; Titanium","Aluminum alloys; Chromium alloys; Electron beams; Feedstocks; Intermetallics; Mechanisms; Microstructure; Powder metals; Quality control; Reusability; Titanium alloys; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Condition; Electron-beam; Fusion process; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Powder bed; Powder characteristics; Reuse; Titania; 3D printers","","","","","GTT-Technologies","The Hitachi-SIMTech joint lab (Singapore) financially supported the work in the research.

It is well known that the naturally formed surface by SLM processing is usually rough and irregular. The effects of the rough surface on heat transfer and fluid flow cannot be neglected when SLM is applied to fields such as heat exchangers and cooling equipment. In this paper, a novel bottom-up approach was proposed to build the naturally formed rough surface by SLM 3D printing. Numerical investigation on pressure loss and heat transfer characteristics of rectangular channels has been carried out based on the naturally formed rough model. Constant thermal boundary and symmetry boundary conditions were employed in the procedure of numerical computation. For comparison, a variety of typical surfaces with different roughness elements in previous studies have been introduced and analyzed. Results confirmed that the proposed rough surface modeling method was fully capable of descripting the real 3D-printed surface topography. Compared with the smooth surface, the heat transfer capacity of the 3D-printed rough channel was increased by 8.99%, while the pressure loss was increased by 25.02%. Additionally, 3D-printed rough surface had better overall thermal performance compared to rough surfaces with regular roughness element.

Because of a powder gas jet setup that is aimed at melting particles in the laser beam before they enter the melting pool, high process speeds of up to several hundred meters per minute and a layer thickness as thin as 25 μm can be achieved. EHLA is generally applied for rotationally symmetric coating applications. In previous experiments on a prototype machine of ponticon GmbH, EHLA was used for building up dense volumes, thus qualifying its use for additive manufacturing, now termed EHLA 3D. In this work, using iron-base alloy 1.4404 and a process speed of 40 m/min, cubic volumes are produced with EHLA 3D. Different deposition strategies commonly used in DED-LB are tested for their transferability to EHLA 3D. The results of different deposition strategies achieving the best near net shape geometry are shown in comparison to DED-LB. Furthermore, the influence of the deposition strategy and used technology on thermal management and microstructure are investigated. The best near net shape is achieved in this comparison using a contour-hatch strategy with 1.5 contours per layer and a 90° rotation of the hatch, both for EHLA and DED-LB. The microstructure of EHLA 3D built cubes is more similar to a typical laser powder bed fusion microstructure than to a typical DED-LB microstructure with respect to grain size and structure. © 2022 Author(s).","","3D printers; Deposition; Geometry; Hatches; Iron alloys; Laser beams; Melting; Coating application; Directed energy; Energy depositions; Fraunhofer; Gas jet; High Speed; Layer thickness; Near net shape; Process speed; Symmetrics; Microstructure","","","","","Stiftung Industrieforschung","The experimental work in this study was part of the master's thesis of Co-Author David Hausch.

Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) material for the specimens and the printing temperature, layer thickness, and surface layer were determined as the control parameters that influenced the surface roughness. Experimental design with Taguchi level 9 (3*3) Orthogonal Arrays (OA) was designed with nine experimental runs. Three levels of each control factor was identified. In addition, data for multi-responses of build time and surface roughness was obtained by utilizing and conducting the nine-requirement experimental run for Taguchi Method. The specimens were printed using an open-source ultrasonic vibration assisted FDM printer with a 20kHz ultrasonic vibration supplied to the printing platform of the printer. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to determine whether p-values are significant with the model or otherwise. The experiments examined the build time and surface roughness, the responses were collected and optimized by using the grey relational grade (GRG). The result shows no correlation between build time and surface roughness in the grey relational grade, and the p-value was higher than 0.05 significant level. However, the surface roughness for optimal level combination setting showed the obvious result, which the settings consist of printing temperature (level 1), layer thickness (level 1), and surface layer (level 1). © 2022 Penerbit UTM Press.

However, the conventional forming methods are difficult to realize the preparation of devices with complex structures and high resolution. In this study, BCZT ceramics were fabricated using vat photopolymerization. The rheological and curing properties of BCZT slurry were investigated systematically. The influences of sintering temperature on the phase composition, microstructure, and electric properties of BCZT ceramics were explored. Results showed that as the sintering temperature increased, the phase composition changed from the rhombohedral phase to the coexistence of tetragonal and rhombohedral phases. Moreover, with increased sintering temperature, the dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties were enhanced significantly. The printed BCZT ceramics sintered at 1500 °C exhibited optimal electric properties: d33 = 430 pC/N, εr = 4800, tan δ = 0.025, Pr = 14.38 μC/cm2. These results indicate that vat photopolymerization is a promising method to prepare high-performance lead-free piezoelectric ceramics. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","BCZT ceramics; Electric properties; Piezoelectric properties; Vat photopolymerization","Phase composition; Piezoelectric ceramics; Piezoelectricity; Sintering; BCZT ceramic; Complexes structure; Lead free ceramics; Lead-Free; Photo polymerization; Piezoelectric components; Piezoelectric property; Property; Sintering temperatures; Vat photopolymerization; Photopolymerization","","","","","Huazhong University of Science & Technology Analytical & Testing Center; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51975230); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; State Key Laboratory of New Ceramics and Fine Processing, (KF202004); State Key Laboratory of New Ceramics and Fine Processing; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2018KFYYXJJ030, 2019kfyXKJC011, 2019kfyXMPY020, 2020kfyFPZX003); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Hubei Technological Innovation Special Fund, (2019AAA002); Hubei Technological Innovation Special Fund","Funding text 1: This work was supported by grants from the Major Special Projects of Technological Innovation in Hubei Province ( 2019AAA002 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51975230 ), Open Project of State Key Laboratory of New Ceramics and Fine Processing of Tsinghua University ( KF202004 ) and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( 2019kfyXMPY020 , 2020kfyFPZX003 , 2018KFYYXJJ030 , 2019kfyXKJC011 ).

HDH Ti powder was hydrophobic surface-treated with methyltrichlorosilane and mixed with spherical powder at a 1:1 ratio to ensure flowability for PBF process. Subsequently, PBF process with practical recoating speed (50 mm/s) and heat treatment process were optimized. It was confirmed that a high specific strength structural material with interesting mechanical properties at a low cost was formed, with a tensile strength of 924 MPa and an elongation of 9.5 %. This paper also discusses an intuitive and accurate apparatus for measuring the spreadability of metal powders for PBF applications. A recoating tester was developed for direct quantification of the spreadability in PBF, and this confirmed the possibility of using the mixed Ti powder containing low price HDH Ti in PBF with practical recoating speed. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Hydrogenation–dehydrogenation titanium powder; Powder bed fusion; Powder spreadability; Recoating tester for powder bed fusion","3D printers; Additives; Costs; Hydrogenation; Hydrophobicity; Surface chemistry; Tensile strength; Hydrogenation–dehydrogenation titania powder; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion; Powder spreadability; Recoating; Recoating tester for powder bed fusion; Spreadability; Ti powders; Titanium powders; Dehydrogenation","","","","","Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE","This work was supported by the Industrial Strategic Technology Development Program-Development of Material Component Technology (20001221, “Development of high strength and fatigue resistance metal and manufacturing technology for root analogue dental implants” and 20013122, “Development of manufacturing technology for casting mold for 3D cooling channels to improve the quality and productivity of automobile parts”) funded By the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE, Korea)","DebRoy T., Mukherjee T., Wei H., Elmer J., Milewski J., Metallurgy, mechanistic models and machine learning in metal printing, Nat.

Electro-mechanical devices are characterized by a dual nature, which combine mechanically moveable parts with electric components. For this reason, their production is particularly advantageous when different additive manufacturing technologies are employed in synergy. In this context, the present work aims at producing and experimentally verify the first functional accelerometer capable of piezoelectric signal readout fully fabricated through additive manufacturing techniques. A smart combination of 3D printing and inkjet materials deposition is here proposed: stereolithography of a photocurable resin is chosen to fabricate the structural components of the accelerometer, while inkjet printing is employed to pattern a P(VDF-TrFE) piezoelectric layer and the corresponding silver electrodes exploited for acceleration readout. The results achieved demonstrate that the proposed hybrid additive manufacturing technology is a very promising route for electro-mechanical sensors fabrication at the mesoscale. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Accelerometer; Inkjet printing; Piezopolymer; Stereolithography","Additives; Electromechanical devices; Fabrication; Ink jet printing; MEMS; Piezoelectricity; Stereolithography; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Additive manufacturing technology; Customizability; Electro-mechanical devices; Inertial sensor; Ink-jet printing; Piezopolymer; Process flexibility; Tridimensionalities; Accelerometers","","","","","3D of Politecnico di Milano","This work was carried out in the framework of the interdepartmental laboratory MEMS&3D of Politecnico di Milano, Italy.","Gibson I., Rosen D.W., Stucker B., Khorasani M., Additive Manufacturing Technologies, (2021); Blachowicz T., Ehrmann A., 3D printed MEMS technology-recent developments and applications, Micromachines, 11, pp. 1-14, (2020); Kumar S., Bhushan P., Pandey M., Bhattacharya S., Additive manufacturing as an emerging technology for fabrication of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), J.

Texture control may be achieved site-specifically by varying the processing variables and tailoring the local melt pool geometry and solidification kinetics. However, the type and direction of textures currently achievable in AM alloys are limited by the melt pool geometry itself. In this work, we advance the capabilities of controlling crystallographic texture in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) by producing specimens of β titanium-niobium alloy with textures aligned along three different directions: the laser scan direction (SD), the build direction (BD), and—for the first time—the direction perpendicular to both BD and SD (i.e., PD). We achieve this three-dimensional (3-D) texture control by fine tuning the keyhole melt pool geometry and amount of overlap throughout the build. We test the tensile properties of the three different specimens along their respective texture axes and elucidate the relationships between crystallographic orientation, mesostructure, and mechanical behavior. We find that the novel PD texture exhibits the best combination of strength, strain hardenability, and ductility. We ascribe these results to the unique mesostructure of this specimen. This work opens new opportunities for designing novel materials with directional properties by achieving three-dimensional (3-D) texture control during fusion-based AM. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Beta Ti alloy; Crystallographic texture control; Deformation behavior; Elastic modulus; Mechanical properties","Geometry; Lakes; Niobium alloys; Textures; Titanium alloys; Beta ti alloy; Build direction; Crystallographic texture control; Crystallographic textures; Deformation behavior; Laser powders; Melt pool; Mesostructures; Powder bed; Ti alloys; Elastic moduli","","","","","FACTS; Nanyang Technological University, NTU, (04INS000761C160); Nanyang Technological University, NTU; School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the NTU Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship (Grant number: 04INS000761C160).

The proposed technique makes use of interlayer application of commercial solder flux to serve as coupling medium for in situ inspection using a special-purpose UT probe. The experimental work was carried out in deposited ER5356 aluminum straight walls following a threefold structure. First, characterization tests with geometrically similar walls with and without interlayer application of solder flux highlight its neutrality, with no effect on the chemical, metallurgical and mechanical properties of the walls. Secondly, UT tests on walls at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 100 °C demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the solder flux as a coupling medium, with little to no soundwave amplitude losses or noise. Finally, acoustic attenuation, impedance and transmission estimations highlight the effectiveness of the proposed technique, establishing a basis for the future development of automated NDT systems for in situ UT of additive manufacturing processes. © 2022 by the authors.","high-temperature inspection; non-destructive testing; ultrasonic testing; wire arc additive manufacturing","","","","","","FCT-MCTES, (UIDB/00667/2020); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia of Portugal; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT; UNIDEMI","The authors acknowledge the supported provided by Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia of Portugal and IDMEC under LAETA-UIDB/50022/2020.

For each topology, three different material configurations including (a) Nylon, (b) Carbon fibre reinforced Nylon and (c) Glass fibre reinforced Nylon were used. A numerical model was constituted to imitate the compressive behaviour of these multi-material cellular structures under quasi-static loading. For the validation, samples were printed with Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) technique and experimentally tested. A good correlation was captured between numerical and experimental analyses. This study found that deploying a multi-material approach enhanced the re-entrant cellular structures specific energy absorption, compressive strength and modulus values over the single Nylon structure of 60 %, 104 % and 201 %, respectively. A similar trend with lesser improvements of 15 %, 60 % and 127 % was monitored for hexagonal cellular structure, in the same sequence. © 2022 The Authors","","Carbon fibers; Cellular automata; Compressive strength; Polyamides; Rayon; Reinforcement; Absorption enhancement; Auxetics; Carbon fiber reinforced; Cellular structure; Lattice structures; Material configurations; Material reinforcement; Multi materials; Multiple materials; Reinforced nylons; Energy absorption","","","","","Royal Academy of Engineering, RAENG, (IFS1819\40)","This research is kindly funded by the Royal Academy of Engineering Industrial Fellowship Scheme , UK.

Previous studies have reported that the microcracks may be eliminated by adding 2 wt% TiB2 ceramic particles, while the modified HX materials are generally classified as HX-based composites. An investigation of the effects of different TiB2 contents (i.e. 1 wt% and 3 wt%) on SLM of HX-TiB2 composites would thus be interesting in terms of the processability, microstructure and mechanical performance. The results indicate that compared to pure HX, microcracks were not detected in the SLM-fabricated neither the HX- 1 wt% TiB2 (HX-1) nor the HX-3 wt% TiB2 (HX-3) composites due to the significant grain-refinement behaviour. The microcracks elimination together with the added TiB2 particles also contributed to a remarkable improvement in the composites’ tensile performance. The determined ultimate tensile strength of HX-1 and HX-3 were 77% and 106% higher than that of pure HX at 850 ℃, respectively. This research also explored the processability and microstructure of HX-TiB2 graded composites by combining the HX-1 and HX-3 via the SLM process, which offers a promising pathway to manufacture advanced components with graded structures and materials via the SLM process. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Composites; Hastelloy-X; High-temperature performance; Selective laser melting; TiB<sub>2</sub> reinforcement","Fabrication; Grain refinement; Melting; Microcracks; Microstructure; Nickel alloys; Selective laser melting; Titanium compounds; Ceramics particles; Classifieds; Hastelloy X; High temperature performance; Laser melting process; Mechanical performance; Microstructure performance; Processability; Selective laser melting; TiB2 reinforcement; Tensile strength","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52005295); Huazhong University of Science and Technology, HUST, (P2022-013); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, (RCBS20200714114921323); Natural Science Foundation of Qingdao, (RZ2021ZR11)","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Gant No. 52005295 ), Shenzhen Science and Technology Program (Grant No. RCBS20200714114921323 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Rizhao (Grant No. RZ2021ZR11) and the State Key Laboratory of Materials Processing and Die & Mould Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Grant No. P2022-013).","Han Q., Mertens R., Montero-Sistiaga M.L., Yang S., Setchi R., Vanmeensel K., Van Hooreweder B., Evans S.L., Fan H., Laser powder bed fusion of Hastelloy X: effects of hot isostatic pressing and the hot cracking mechanism, Mater.

SLM is a 3D printing technology. Blue diode laser is anticipated to effectively form pure copper parts because the absorptance of 450 nm light on pure copper is higher than that of conventional 1 μm light. In our previous study, the authors reported a newly developed blue diode laser whose wavelength was 450 nm. Laser power and fiber core diameter were 200 W and 100 μm, respectively. In this study, the height and width of the copper part were changed, and their influence on the density of the parts was investigated. As a result, it was found that the larger the volume of the fabricated copper part, the lower the density. In addition, the diluted layer of pure copper and the stainless steel baseplate in the copper part were measured. By controlling the amount of laser heat input between the diluted layer and the undiluted layer, it was possible to form a pure copper part with a high density of 99.6%.  © 2022 Author(s).","","Additives; Diodes; Laser beam welding; Melting; Semiconductor lasers; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Absorptance; Blue diode laser; Copper parts; Laser induced; Printing technologies; Pure copper; Relative density; Selective laser melting; Selective laser melting","","","","","New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, NEDO","The authors would like to acknowledge JBM Engineering Corporation for technical assistance with the experiments.

The manufacturing of mechanically sustainable composites structures are currently needed. In the recent past, few scientific studies have reported modifying the mechanical properties of thermoplastic material using the metal spraying method by the FFF process. In this study, the acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS-based thermoplastic composites structures have been prepared by Aluminum (Al) metal spray. To investigate the effect of Al spray reinforcement, three input parameters have been selected: the number of sprayed layers (2, 3, and 4), infill pattern (line, triangle, and cubic), and infill density (60, 80, and 100%). The results of the study suggested that maximum strength at peak and maximum strength at break have been observed for composite structures prepared with three number of Al spray layers, triangular-shaped infill printing pattern, and 100% infill density. The genetic algorithm-based multi-objective analysis has been performed for the selection of optimum process parameters. Results of the study were supported with crystallinity analysis using x-ray diffraction (XRD), particle analysis using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), and fracture analysis using optical microscopy. © 2022, ASM International.","ABS; ABS-Al composites; Al; FFF; metal reinforcement; tensile strength","3D printers; Butadiene; Crystallinity; Genetic algorithms; Infill drilling; Metal analysis; Polymer blends; Reinforced plastics; Structure (composition); Styrene; Tensile strength; ABS; ABS-aluminum composite; Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene; Alternating layers; Aluminum composites; Composites structures; Fused filament fabrication; Maximum strength; Metal reinforcement; Thermoplastic materials; Scanning electron microscopy","","","","","Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana and University Center for Research and Development, Chandigarh University; Center for Manufacturing Research","Authors are highly thankful to the Center for Manufacturing Research, Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana and University Center for Research and Development, Chandigarh University for technical/experimental assistance in this research work.","Meisner M.D., Robin W.N.M., Three-Dimensional Modelling and/or Manufacturing Apparatus, and Related Processes, U.S. Patent Application, 137, 10; Wu P., Wang J., Wang X., A Critical Review of the Use of 3-D Printing in the Construction Industry, Autom.

This work investigated the corrosion fatigue response of a zinc-magnesium (Zn-Mg) alloy gyroid scaffold fabricated via laser-powder-bed-fusion additive manufacturing at the first time. The high-cycle compression-compression fatigue testing of the printed Zn-Mg scaffold was conducted in simulated body fluid, showing its favorable fatigue strength, structural reliability, and anti-fatigue capability. The printed Zn-Mg scaffold obtained a 227% higher fatigue strength than that of the printed Zn scaffold but 17% lower strain accumulation at 106 cycles. The accumulative strain of the Zn-Mg scaffold at its fatigue strength was dominant by fatigue ratcheting, since the fatigue damage strain of the scaffold was approximately zero. The corrosion products (ZnO and Zn(OH)2) were conducive to the inhibition of fatigue ratcheting and fatigue damage. Dislocation pile-up and solid solution phases at the grain boundaries of the Zn-Mg scaffold could retard the spreading of the crack tip and impede excessive grain coarsening, improving its fatigue endurance limit. Notably, the printed Zn-Mg scaffold could dissipate the fatigue energy through moderate grain boundary migration, thus reducing its plastic deformation. These findings illuminated the anti-fatigue mechanisms related to microstructural features and corrosive environments and highlighted the promising prospects of additively manufactured Zn-Mg scaffolds in orthopedic applications. Statement of significance: Additive manufacturing (AM) of biodegradable metals shows unprecedented prospects for bone tissue regeneration medicine. The corrosion fatigue property is one of the key determinants in the performance of AM biodegradable scaffolds. In this study, a Zn-Mg gyroid scaffold was additively manufactured with admirable fatigue endurance limit and anti-fatigue capability. We reported that the corrosion fatigue performance was highly relevant to the microstructural features, validating that the grain boundary engineering strategy improved fatigue strength and inhibited crack penetration. Notably, moderate grain boundary migration could dissipate fatigue energy and reduce plastic deformation. Furthermore, corrosion products were conducive to impeding fatigue ratcheting and fatigue damage, indicating the promising potential of AM Zn-Mg scaffolds in treating load-bearing bone defects. © 2022 Acta Materialia Inc.","Additive manufacturing; Corrosion fatigue; Laser powder bed fusion; Triply periodic minimal surface; Zinc-magnesium","Absorbable Implants; Alloys; Biocompatible Materials; Corrosion; Magnesium; Materials Testing; Plastics; Reproducibility of Results; Zinc; 3D printers; Additives; Binary alloys; Body fluids; Coarsening; Corrosion fatigue; Crack tips; Fatigue damage; Fatigue testing; Grain boundaries; II-VI semiconductors; Piles; Plastic deformation; Scaffolds; Zinc alloys; Zinc oxide; magnesium; zinc; alloy; biomaterial; magnesium; plastic; zinc; Anti-fatigue; Corrosion-fatigue; Fatigue ratcheting; Fatigue strength; Gyroids; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; Triply periodic minimal surfaces; Zinc-magnesium; Article; body fluid; compression; compressive strength; controlled study; corrosion; electron diffraction; fatigue; finite element analysis; human; porosity; relative density; scanning electron microscopy; three dimensional printing; transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; Young modulus; biodegradable implant; chemistry; corrosion; materials testing; reproducibility; Magnesium alloys","","magnesium, 7439-95-4; zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6; Alloys, ; Biocompatible Materials, ; Magnesium, ; Plastics, ; Zinc, ","","","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2022TQ0110); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFC2400400); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; Guangxi Key Research and Development Program, (2020BAB049); Guangxi Key Research and Development Program; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2022A1515010304); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","The research was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2021YFC2400400), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation ( 2022TQ0110 ), the Hubei Key Research and Development Program (2020BAB049), and the Guangdong Province Basic and Applied Basic Research Fund Project (2022A1515010304).
