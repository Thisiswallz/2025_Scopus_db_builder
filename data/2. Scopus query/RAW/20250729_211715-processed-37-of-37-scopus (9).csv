One of the main advantages of this technology is the possibility to produce a shape with complex geometry in a reduced time. Therefore, Additive Manufacturing is often applied in rapid prototyping, which is an essential activity for the evaluation and testing of the design concepts. Even if the advantages and drawbacks of 3D printing are well known in the literature, there is still a lack of tools and methodologies to support a rapid techno-economic analysis for selecting the key manufacturing process between traditional machining tools and 3D printing. A case study on a 3D part of moderate complexity, a gas burner head, fabricated by additive manufacturing, using selective laser melting, has been described in this paper. This test case is focused on the context of rapid prototyping. The 3D part is a gas burner head which has to be printed for testing activity. The analysis focuses on the cost, time, and quality of the built part. An analytical approach has been proposed to calculate the cost of the 3D printing process. The analytical cost is related to the results of the numerical simulations to support the techno-economic analysis. The paper shows a method to compare additive manufacturing and traditional machining processes in rapid prototyping. However, the paper also shows a simulation activity to analyze with more details the 3D printing process in terms of part orientation and deformation of the build. © 2021 CAD Solutions, LLC.","3D printing simulation;

The ion-exchange capacity of the Nafion membrane was tested, and the morphology of IPMCs was observed. The electro-mechanical properties of IPMCs under AC voltage inputs were studied, and grasping experiments were performed. The results show that the Nafion membrane after hydrolysis has a good ion-exchange ability and water-holding capacity. SEM observed that the thickness of the IPMC’s electrode layer was about 400 nm, and the platinum layer was tightly combined with the substrate membrane. When using a square wave input of 3.5 V and 0.1 Hz, the maximum current of IPMCs reached 0.30 A, and the displacement and blocking force were 7.57 mm and 10.5 mN, respectively. The new fabrication process ensures the good driving performance of the printed IPMC. And two pieces of IPMCs can capture the irregular objects successfully, indicating the feasibility of printing IPMCs by FDM technology. This paper provides a new and simple method for the fabrication of three-dimensional IPMCs, which can be further applied in flexible grippers and soft robotics. © 2021 The Author(s).

This work aims to study the microstructural homogeneity evolution of β phases, such as size, morphology, distribution, crystallographic orientation, and phase composition in different regions of the SLM Ti-6Zr-5Fe near β titanium alloy. The results indicate that the microstructure in different regions of SLM Ti-6Zr-5Fe alloy sample is quite different. The β phase in the bottom area had the smallest size about 7.25 μm, the β phase in the side-top area had the largest size about 20.56 μm. The β phase in the side-middle and middle part had a lower aspect ratio of 1.52 and 1.59, the β phase in the side-bottom and top part had a larger aspect ratio of 1.93 and 1.92. Most of the β phase in the side-bottom and top part had the 〈001〉 crystal orientation towards build direction and laser moving direction, the texture type in other regions was random. The α phase in the top of the SLM Ti-6Zr-5Fe sample had a smaller size than that in the middle and bottom of the sample. Meanwhile, the microhardness in the top of SLM Ti-6Zr-5Fe sample was higher than that in the middle and bottom of the sample. The temperature gradients, cooling rates, and reheating treatment play different leading roles in different regions of the SLM Ti-6Zr-5Fe alloy sample. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Homogeneity; Microstructure; Selective laser melting; Ti-6Zr-5Fe alloy","Aspect ratio; Cooling; Crystal orientation; Deposition; Industrial heating; Iron alloys; Melting; Microstructural evolution; Morphology; Phase composition; Selective laser melting; Ternary alloys; Textures; Thermal gradients; Zircaloy; Additive manufacturing technology; Build direction; Crystallographic orientations; Different layers; Microstructural homogeneity; Moving direction; Near beta titanium alloys; Selective laser melting (SLM); Titanium alloys","","","","","Beijing Laboratory of Metallic Materials and Processing for Modern Transportation; National Natural Science Fund for Innovative Research Groups; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (91860113); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, (2202007); Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, (51621003)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by Beijing Natural Science Foundation [Grant No. 2202007], National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant No. 91860113], National Natural Science Fund for Innovative Research Groups [Grant No. 51621003], and the Beijing Laboratory of Metallic Materials and Processing for Modern Transportation.; Funding text 2: This work was supported by Beijing Natural Science Foundation [Grant No. 2202007 ], National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant No. 91860113 ], National Natural Science Fund for Innovative Research Groups [Grant No. 51621003 ], and the Beijing Laboratory of Metallic Materials and Processing for Modern Transportation .","Pal S., Lojen G., Hudak R., Rajtukova V., Brajlih T., Kokol V., Drstvensek I., As-fabricated surface morphologies of Ti-6Al-4V samples fabricated by different laser processing parameters in selective laser melting, Addit.

The standard process model of the SLS process consists of three stages. (i) The preheating stage, where the building chamber is heated up, (ii) the layer-wise building stage during which cross sections of the part are molten using a laser beam and remain as melt, captured by the surrounding powder, and (iii) the cooling stage where crystallization of the part is assumed to be induced. In the present work we investigate this process model by means of experiments and a verified and validated finite element simulation tool. It will be shown that crystallization may already be induced during the building stage after the deposition and melting of a few layers. To account for typical temperature fields as they arise in SLS, i.e. with negative and positive cooling rates, the standard Nakamura crystallization model is adapted to allow for negative crystallization rates of partially crystallized material, once the melting temperature is reached. Further, a dependency of the average temperature and crystallization fields on the geometry will be shown. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Crystallization; Finite element simulation; Heat equation; Selective laser sintering","Laser beams; Laser heating; Melting; Sintering; Building chambers; Crystallization fields; Crystallization modeling; Crystallization rates; Experimental investigations; Finite element simulations; Manufacturing techniques; Selective laser sintering(SLS); Selective laser sintering","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (61375930- SFB 814)","Funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft ( DFG , German Research Foundation) Project-ID 61375930- SFB 814 ‘Additive Manufacturing’ TP C03 and B03.","Jamshidinia M., Kong F., Kovacevic R., Numerical modeling of heat distribution in the electron beam melting ®of Ti-6Al-4V, J.

While most commonly used FDM filaments are PLA and ABS, nylon is a widely used thermoplastic polymer in industry. This study investigated the mechanical properties of FDM-produced specimens made of nylon and quantified the effect of process parameters such as raster orientation and nozzle temperature on the mechanical properties. As the nozzle temperature increases, specimens become stronger with higher elongations at the break. This is mainly due to the improved fusion between the layers, provided by an expansion of the heat-affected zone. On the other hand, specimens with diagonal raster orientation exhibit higher elongations than those with perpendicular and parallel raster. The findings also emphasize the synergistic effects between nozzle temperature and printing orientation, showing that optimization should consider the two parameters together. Overall, FDM can produce strong nylon parts with adequate ductility suitable for load-bearing applications. However, achieving such results requires a detailed optimization of process parameters. © International Journal of Modern Manufacturing Technologies.","Additive Manufacturing; Fused Deposition Modeling; Mechanical Properties; Nylon; Polyamide","","","","","","METU; Orta Doğu Teknik Üniversitesi","This project was supported by the undergraduate research program AdımODTÜ by Middle East Technical University.

Composite materials are of great interest, as they allow to combine the useful properties of the composite constituent elements and expand parts manufacturing possibilities. Parts manufacturing from composites by selective laser melting (SLM) is interesting because the composite material is formed during the build process. There is a wide opportunity to combine the composition of the raw material for powder. Special attention is paid to composites with TiC-reinforced steel matrix. Carbide is able to improve performance and reduce the weight of the product due to low density. The formation of the composite in the process of SLM is not fully investigated and creates prerequisites for a more in-depth study. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Additive technologies;

To monitor the deformation of soft robotic systems, elastomer-based sensors are being used. However, the embedding of sensors into soft actuator modules by polymer casting is time consuming and difficult to upscale. In this study, it is shown how a pneumatic bending actuator with an integrated sensing element can be produced using an extrusion-based additive manufacturing method, e.g., fused deposition modeling (FDM). The advantage of FDM against direct printing or robocasting is the significantly higher resolution and the ability to print large objectives in a short amount of time. New, commercial launched, pellet-based FDM printers are able to 3D print thermoplastic elastomers of low shore hardness that are required for soft robotic applications, to avoid high pressure for activation. A soft pneumatic actuator with the in situ integrated piezoresistive sensor element was successfully printed using a commercial styrene-based thermoplastic elastomer (TPS) and a developed TPS/carbon black (CB) sensor composite. It has been demonstrated that the integrated sensing elements could monitor the deformation of the pneumatic soft robotic actuator. The findings of this study contribute to extending the applicability of additive manufacturing for integrated soft sensors in large soft robotic systems. © 2021 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; fused deposition modeling; piezoresistive sensor; pneumatic actuator; soft robotics","","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (828818)","This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No. 828818 (SHERO PROJECT).

The process of SLM is defined by several parameters like laser power, laser scanning speed, hatch spacing, or layer thickness. The manufacturing of small components via AM is very difficult as it sets high demands on the powder to be used and on the SLM process in general. Hence, SLM with subsequent micromilling is a suitable method for the production of microstructured, additively manufactured components. One application for this kind of components is microstructured implants which are typically unique and therefore well suited for additive manufacturing. In order to enable the micromachining of additively manufactured materials, the influence of the special properties of the additive manufactured material on micromilling processes needs to be investigated. In this research, a detailed characterization of additive manufactured workpieces made of AISI 316L is shown. Further, the impact of the process parameters and the build-up direction defined during SLM on the workpiece properties is investigated. The resulting impact of the workpiece properties on micromilling is analyzed and rated on the basis of process forces, burr formation, surface roughness, and tool wear. Significant differences in the results of micromilling were found depending on the geometry of the melt paths generated during SLM. © 2020, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; Machining; Micromilling; Selective laser melting","Additives; Cutting tools; Micromachining; Microstructure; Powder metals; Selective laser melting; Surface roughness; Laser scanning speed; Layer thickness; Metal additives; Micromilling process; Process parameters; Selective laser melting (SLM); Small components; Special properties; Milling (machining)","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (172116086–SFB 926, AU 185/57-1); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG","Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

Since PEEK is a semi-crystalline polymer, we employ a non-isothermal quiescent crystallization model, informed by infra-red (IR)-imaging measurements, to understand our findings. We propose that, under typical FFF cooling conditions, the weld region between filaments remains amorphous. In contrast, the core of the filament has increased time above the glass transition temperature allowing for a significant crystal fraction to develop. We correlate the predicted crystal fraction to a storage modulus using the Halpin and Kardos model. With only a single model fitting parameter we can make reasonable predictions for the perpendicular and parallel storage moduli measured via DMA over a range of printing conditions. This work provides a foundation for optimizing crystallization for the mechanical performance of the FFF printed PEEK. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA); Fused filament fabrication (FFF); Infra-red (IR) thermography; Polyether ether ketone (PEEK); Quiescent crystallization model","Crystals; Elastic moduli; Fabrication; Glass transition; Ketones; Cooling conditions; Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA); Imaging measurements; Mechanical performance; Polyether ether ketones (PEEK); Printing conditions; Quiescent crystallizations; Semi-crystalline polymer; Ethers","","","","","Royal Society, (IESR3/183003); Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851; China Scholarship Council, CSC","The first author would like to give thanks to the China Scholarship Council (CSC) of China for the support of this project.

Design/methodology/approach: The research was divided into two activities: simple; and complex-part production capability. In the simple-part step, the performance of gypsum powder and the minimum mold thickness that would withstand the casting process. In the complex-part step, the authors first investigated the powder removability as a function of geometry complexity and then binder jetting performance was evaluated for the case of lattice-structure fabrication. Findings: All the geometries tested withstand the casting process demonstrating the benefits in terms of complexity part design; however, the process suffers of all the typical defect of casting as misrun, porosity and cold shut. Originality/value: The results found in this research improve the benefits related to additive manufacturing application in industrial environment and in particular to the binder jetting technology and the rapid casting approach. © 2021, Luca Giorleo and Michele Bonaventi.","Binder jetting;

In order to reduce the roughness of these surfaces different treatments could be applied, but all of them have limitations when applied to SLM parts. One of the main challenges for surface treatments is to provide quality surfaces regardless of its starting state or geometry. Currently, chemical polishing is the best positioned treatment to achieve this but it usually employs hazardous electrolytes. Therefore, more comparative data about the performance of alternative treatments to polish parts with different geometrical characteristics are required by industry. In this study, electropolishing, blasting and laser have been applied, either separately or combined, to complex SLM Ti6Al4 V parts.

In pursuit of assuring quality in the selective laser sintering (SLS) AM, this paper builds a modeling and control framework of the key thermodynamic interactions between the laser source and the materials to be processed. First, we develop a three-dimensional finite element simulation to understand the important features of the melt pool evolution for designing sensing and feedback algorithms. We explore how the temperature field is affected by hatch spacing and thermal properties that are temperature-dependent. Based on high-performance computer simulation and experimentation, we then validate the existence and effect of periodic disturbances induced by the repetitive in- and cross-layer thermomechanical interactions. From there, we identify the system model from the laser power to the melt pool width and build a repetitive control algorithm to greatly attenuate variations of the melt pool geometry. © 2021 ASME Letters in Dynamic Systems and Control.

Unfortunately, the ubiquitous stratified build approach used by these technologies is responsible for the pain point that hinders their adoption in production of parts that will be subjected to complex loads: the junction of adjacent layers tends to have subpar mechanical properties when compared to those of the bulk material, and thus, assessing the structural integrity of an AM part becomes difficult. In the advent of the industrialization of series production of AM parts for the automotive industry, the necessity to understand and predict how and why AM parts fail under complex stress states becomes of paramount importance. This paper applies a failure criterion for materials with anisotropic properties with stress interactions, to predict failure of multi-jet fusion (MJF) parts manufactured using polyamide 12 powder. The results are compared to the failure surfaces of Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) components. Special test specimens were designed, produced, and tested to measure failure under tensile, compressive, shear, and combined loading scenarios. The results show that much like SLS, MJF parts have a notable difference in tensile and compressive strengths. Unlike SLS however, MJF parts do not exhibit a strong interaction between stresses when under combined loading. The experimental data shows an excellent fit with the failure criterion, precisely capturing the strength behavior of MJF printed parts under complex loading conditions. Of great interest in this study is that the stress interactions with MJF parts were determined to be negligible when compared to SLS specimens, which emphasizes the fact that when performing stress analyses, each one of these powder-based additive manufacturing techniques must be treated differently. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Failure criterion; Multi-jet fusion (MJF); PA12; Selective laser sintering (SLS)","Additives; Aerospace industry; Compressive strength; Laser heating; Oil well drilling equipment; Selective laser sintering; Sintering; Anisotropic property; Complex geometries; Complex stress state; Manufacturing techniques; Product development cycle; Selective laser sintering(SLS); Stress interaction; Strong interaction; Failure (mechanical)","","","","","","","Kianian B., 3D printing and additive manufacturing state of the industry, annual worldwide progress report: chapters titles: The Middle East, and other countries, Wohlers Rep., 22, (2017); Wong K.V., Hernandez A., A review of additive manufacturing, Int.

Among them, polylactic acid (PLA) is particularly appreciated, as it is a bioderivation polymer, biodegradable and compostable with high thicknesses, with excellent shape memory properties, which can be activated by varying the temperature of the material across the glass transition temperature. In this study, PLA is used in the 4D printing process for the manufacturing of complex geometry components by Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM), with a potential as stress-absorbers. The shape memory properties of the manufactured component have been tested varying the operational parameters of the printing process (i.e., the temperature at the nozzle, the deposition speed, the layer thickness) as well as the activation temperature that allows the recovery of the initial shape. In particular, the time needed to recover the shape and the percentage of recovery with respect to the initial shape were assessed. Experimental results have shown that PLA components have adequate shape memory properties, with short recovery times and high recovery rates being easily achievable. Among process parameters, the activation temperature is found to be the most significant parameter to trigger the recovery of the initial shape in the shortest possible time. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","4D printing;

The preferred raw material is silica (quartz) sand, as it is the most readily available and cost effective sand. However, silica sand as a refractory material has some technical limitations, including high thermal linear expansion, low refractoriness, and thermal conductivity. Therefore, it is not suitable for all castings. Other refractory sand types are available, including chromite sand, which is abundantly available in South Africa. Analysis of the physical and chemical properties of in-laboratory coating of a locally available chromite sand was conducted through known metal foundry tests that provide an understanding of the quality and suitability of the use of chromite sand as a potential substitute for silica material for rapid sand-casting applications. The results of this study will inform the industry about the optimisation of parameters for the manufacturing of a resin-coated chromite sand and its use in additive manufacturing using a Voxeljet VX 1000 printer. © 2021, South African Institute of Industrial Engineering.

Especially in highly complex applications with small batches, such as aerospace or tooling, laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) has become established. But one of its major limitations is the size of the build chamber, which is limited to around 800 x 400 x 500 mm for the largest machine that is currently available. One solution to overcome this size limitation is to weld additive manufactured parts. While it has been proven for different materials that conventional welding processes can be applied to LPBF manufactured parts, the resulting weld seam quality for AlSi10Mg is still insufficient. By using laser welding in a vacuum, which is a newly developed and highly efficient laser welding process, the quality of the weld seams, especially in terms of porosity, can be improved. This technology is used to produce weld seams that are then tested for their mechanical properties. Finally, a solution for combining LPBF parts with conventional aluminium alloys is presented. © 2021, South African Institute of Industrial Engineering.

However, poor surface finish, inadequate dimensional accuracy, and high manufacturing costs impede the technology to be adopted in the mould-making industry as an alternative. In this study, a time-efficient machined substrate hybrid AM strategy was developed for the fabrication of injection mould inserts using a hybrid additive-subtractive powder bed fusion process. The primary goal is to reduce AM build and post-processing time. Pre-machined support-free substrate blocks with position alignment and referencing features for subsequent machining operations were used for the additive manufacturing and high-speed machining processes. Four mould inserts, selected from a production injection mould, were redesigned with conformal cooling channels and fabricated in a metal powder bed fusion system using the standard AM practice and the proposed hybrid-build method. In comparison with the standard AM practice, a considerable saving in processing time was attained, but with a slight compromise in tensile strength. Through optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), a strong fusion bonding can be seen at the interface boundary between the additive powder and machined substrate. This new strategy will provide mould performance enhancement at reduced manufacturing costs for the plastic products manufacturing industry. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Additive manufacturing; Hybrid additive-subtractive manufacturing; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Powder bed fusion","3D printers; Additives; Costs; Injection molding; Machining; Machining centers; Molds; Plastic products; Plastics industry; Powder metals; Scanning electron microscopy; Tensile strength; Conformal cooling channels; Dimensional accuracy; High speed machining; Injection mould inserts; Interface boundaries; Machining operations; Manufacturing industries; Performance enhancements; Substrates","","","","","CAMEX Limited","The authors wish to thank Viscount Plastics for their consent and support of this research study.

However, existing FDM extruders are usually short and fat, which significantly restricts the popularization of multi-axis FDM 3D printing technology because one significant trend of additive manufacturing is the use of long and thin extruders to avoid collisions between extruders and workpieces in the printing process. This paper presents the design of a throat-extended FDM extruder to print complex-shaped workpieces with details. The main contributions in this paper include: (i) presenting a novel extruder structure including an extended-throat, a smaller heater block, and a cooling mini-fan; (ii) designing an optimized heater block using the shapes of its components and the milling tool as constraints to make its volume as little small as possible; (iii) Construct experimental and simulation methods to examine the temperature distribution of the throat to optimize the shapes of the heat dams of nozzle throats and the wind speed of the heat-dissipation fan. Based on the throat-extended FDM extruder, a five-axis FDM 3D printer has been developed, and various complex-shaped workpieces have been printed without any support. © 2021 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

In the present work, an ML based framework is proposed to predict the evolution of local strain distribution, plastic anisotropy and failure during tensile deformation of AlSi10Mg aluminum alloy produced by selective laser melting (SLM). The framework combines the methods involved in additive manufacturing (AM) and artificial intelligence (AI). This includes printing of test specimens using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), x-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning to measure internal defects distribution, mechanical testing with digital image correlation (DIC) to get local strain evolution, extraction and coupling of CT and DIC data, and the development, validation and evaluation of an artificial neural network (ANN) model. The experimental data from CT and DIC measurements are used to train, validate and evaluate the proposed ANN model. Microstructural features such as the size, shape, volume fraction and distribution of porosity are used as an input to ANN. The proposed ANN model successfully predicts the evolution of local strains, plastic anisotropy and failure during tensile deformation. The intensity and location of strain hotspots as well as the shape of shear bands and the location of crack initiation are well predicted. The current research demonstrates the applicability of an ML based ANN approach to predict microstructure - property - performance relationships for engineering materials with intricate heterogeneous microstructures such as those produced additively by SLM. The success of the present approach motivates further use of ML techniques, as a mean for accelerated development of new alloys, AM process optimization and its wide scale applicability.  © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.","Artificial intelligence; Fracture; Machine learning; Plastic anisotropy; Selective laser melting","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Anisotropy; Computerized tomography; Deformation; Failure (mechanical); Forecasting; Machine learning; Mechanical testing; Microstructure; Neural networks; Optimization; Selective laser melting; Strain; Turing machines; Artificial neural network models; D. digital image correlation (DIC); Engineering materials; Heterogeneous microstructure; Microstructural features; Microstructure properties; Selective laser melting (SLM); X-ray computed tomography; Plastics industry","","","","","CanmetMATERIALS of Natural Resources Canada; Industrial Research Chair; NSERC-IRC, (IRCPJ-503185-2016); General Motors of Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","The authors are thankful to Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council - Industrial Research Chair (NSERC-IRC) under grant no.

During the printing process, the meltpool is created, which controls the build parts' microstructure and quality. So, it is crucial to determine the meltpool size and establish the effect of process parameters on the meltpool dimensions. An analytical approach is utilized to determine the meltpool size. These predicted data from the analytical approach were validated with experimental data. Inconel 718 powder was used to fabricate the cubed shaped samples with a combination of different SLM process parameters; namely, laser power; scanning speed; and hatching space. Meltpool dimensions were measured from the microstructure images of the samples. After the validation of analytical data with experimental data, the effect of SLM process parameters on meltpool dimensions was established. The result shows that the SLM process parameters significantly affects meltpool geometry, which is very useful for selecting suitable process parameters. © 2021 Old City Publishing.

It is thus seen as a hope for a shift towards decentralised production and the associated positive effects on the environment. The most widespread process, Fused Filament Fabrication, already impresses with a large variety of materials and the possibility of including non-polymeric additives as fibre materials. To support this development, this paper describes a form of wire implementation as an add-on for existing FFF systems, that can be realised without major changes to hardware or software. The aim is to integrate electrical functions directly into the component - in one manufacturing process. The process is based on a hybrid material made of PLA with a copper core, which was developed in advance. Within this work, two retrofittable units for FFF printers are described, which cut a continuous wire with a diameter of 0.2mm embedded in a polymer in a fully automatic manner. Furthermore, two thermal contacting processes are presented, which make it possible to contact the embedded wire via the heated extruder nozzle and metallic inserts. Thereby, a best contact resistance of 0.009 ± 0.0023Ω (50% confidence interval) could be achieved for a screw contact. For a plug-in or solder contacts, a contact resistance of 0.059 ± 0.028Ω (50% confidence interval) was realised. In terms of process technology, the wire deposition within the plastic structure could be reliably realised at printing speeds of 10mm/s on straight sections and 1mm/s in curves with a radius of 5mm. The developed process was successfully validated using a functional demonstrator. The functional sample can be selectively heated to the glass transition temperature and reversibly formed. In summary, the developed methods are suitable for cost-effectively expanding existing FFF systems to integrate electrical functions during the 3D printing process. © 2013 IEEE.","3D-printing; additive manufacturing; automated contacting; automated wire placement; composite materials; computer aided manufacturing; contact resistance; embedded wires; generative manufacturing; hybrid filament; hybrid integrated circuits; integrated circuit manufacture; integrated manufacturing systems; thermoforming","3D printers; Additives; Contact resistance; Fabrication; Glass transition; Hybrid materials; Polymers; Printing presses; 3D printing process; Automated cutting; Confidence interval; Functional parts; Manufacturing process; Metallic inserts; Plastic structure; Process Technologies; Wire","","","","","","","Additive Fertigung: Branchentrends Und-Prognosen, (2020); Trends in 3D Printing at Scale: A Survey of 3D Printing Stakeholders in Production Manufacturing, Dimensional Res., (2020); Crabtree J., Dunham S., The additive manufacturing landscape 2020-AMFG, Proc.

Design/methodology/approach: The effect of sintering parameters including laser power, scanning speed and slice thickness on strength and accuracy of selective laser sintering (SLS) parts were analyzed experimentally. Then, the laser sintering mechanism of nylon-12 coated copper was discussed through analyzing the interfacial reaction of nylon-12 and copper. The SLS parts were infiltrated with epoxy resin to meet the strength requirements of injection molding. Findings: In this study, mechanical mixed nylon-12/copper and nylon-12 coated copper composite powders were investigated and compared as SLS materials. An effective dissolution–precipitation method was proposed to prepare nylon-12 coated copper powders with better processing and mechanical properties. The bending strength and modulus of fabricated parts after infiltration with epoxy reach 65.3 MPa and 3,200 MPa, respectively. Originality/value: The composite materials can be used in the manufacture of injection molds with a conformal cooling channel for the production of common plastics in prototype quantities, showing a broad application prospect in rapid tooling. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing;

Conventionally, these devices are fabricated using techniques such as soft-lithography, paper microfluidics, micromachining, injection moulding, etc. The advancement in modern additive manufacturing methods is making three dimensional printing (3DP) a promising platform for the fabrication of microfluidic devices. Particularly, the availability of low-cost desktop 3D printers can produce inexpensive microfluidic devices in fast turnaround times. In this paper, we explore fused deposition modelling (FDM) to print non-transparent and closed internal micro features of in-plane microchannels (i.e., linear, curved and spiral channel profiles) and varying cross-section microchannels in the build direction (i.e., helical microchannel). The study provides a comparison of the minimum possible diameter size, the maximum possible fluid flow-rate without leakage, and absorption through the straight, curved, spiral and helical microchannels along with the printing accuracy of the FDM process for two low-cost desktop printers. Moreover, we highlight the geometry dependent printing issues of microchannels, pressure developed in the microchannels for complex geometry and establish that the profiles in which flowrate generates 4000 Pa are susceptible to leakages when no pre or post processing in the FDM printed parts is employed. © 2020 by the authors.

Significant variation in the mechanical properties of 3D printed specimens is observed because of varied process parameters and interfacial bonding between consecutive layers. This study investigates the influence of heat treatment on the mechanical strength of FDM 3D printed Polylactic acid (PLA) parts with constant 3DP parameters and ambient conditions. To meet the objectives, 7 sets, each containing 5 dog-bone shaped samples, were fabricated from commercially available PLA filament. Each set was subjected to heat treatment at a particular temperature for 1 h and cooled in the furnace itself, while one set was left un-treated. The temperature for heat treatment (Th) varied from 30 °C to 130 °C with increments of 10 °C. The heat-treated samples were characterized under tensile loading of 400 N and mechanical properties like Young's modulus (E), Strain % (ϵ) and Stiffness (k) were evaluated. On comparing the mechanical properties of heat-treated samples to un-treated samples, significant improvements were observed. Heat treatment also altered the geometries of the samples. Mechanical properties improved by 4.88 % to 10.26 % with the maximum being at Th of 110 °C and below recrystallization temperature (Tr) of 65 °C. Deformations also decreased significantly at higher temperatures above 100 °C, by a maximum of 36.06 %. The dimensions of samples showed a maximum decrease of 1.08 % in Tr range and a maximum decrease of 0.31 % in weight at the same temperature. This study aims to benefit the society by establishing suitable Th to recover the lost strength in PLA based FDM 3D printed parts.  © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston, Germany 2021.","3D printing (3DP); annealing, polylactic acid (PLA); Fused deposition modelling (FDM); interfacial bonding; recrystallization temperature","Deposition; Elastic moduli; Fused Deposition Modeling; Heat treatment; Polyesters; Strain; Ambient conditions; Effect of heat treatments; Fused deposition modelling; Interfacial bonding; Poly lactic acid; Process parameters; Recrystallization temperatures; Tensile loading; Stiffness","","","","","Ministry of Human Resource Development, MHRD, (2015-PN-1); Ministry of Human Resource Development, MHRD","This research work was supported by Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) under the Design Innovation Centre (DIC) project “Medical devices and restorative technologies” [Reference no.17-11/2015-PN-1].

However, residual deformation of the metal builds has been a significant issue. Laser scanning strategies adopted in the laser-assisted fabricating process have proved to have important influence on the residual stress and deformation. As the main contribution of this paper, the effects of different laser scanning strategies are incorporated into the modified inherent strain modeling (MISM) framework for the first time to enable accurate simulation for residual deformation of the L-PBF metal parts. Anisotropy in mechanical property of the fabricated components caused by the laser scanning strategies is also fully considered. For the rotational laser scanning strategies, only a small-scale representative volume element (RVE) is modeled by employing both the inherent strains and asymptotic homogenization. By employing the homogenized inherent strains, residual deformation can be predicted for the L-PBF manufactured components using different rotational scanning strategies accurately. Regarding the unidirectional parallel line scanning strategy, the directional inherent strain vector and orthotropic mechanical properties are used in the MISM-based layer-wise simulation. Good accuracy of the proposed framework is fully validated through comparing the simulated residual deformations with the experimental results for Inconel 718 parts produced by different laser scanning strategies. Thus, it is demonstrated that the effects of both parallel line and rotational laser scanning strategies have been successfully integrated into the MISM framework for predicting residual deformations of the L-PBF builds. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Homogenization; Inherent strain; Laser scanning strategy; Material property anisotropy; Residual deformation","3D printers; Deformation; Laser applications; Powder metals; Scanning; Asymptotic homogenization; Fabricating process; Inherent strain; Laser scanning; Representative volume element (RVE); Residual deformation; Scanning strategies; Stress and deformation; Strain","","","","","Andrew Holmes in the Swanson Center for Product Innovation; NASA STTR; SCPI","Funding text 1: The authors want to gratefully acknowledge financial support provided by the NASA STTR, USA program.

One of the main challenges of this process is the preparation of a homogeneous and stable ceramic slurry with a high solid load and low viscosity. In this work, different dispersants and resins were tested, aiming to provide a solvent-free slurry suitable for DLP additive manufacturing. Disperbyk-111 and PEGDA 250 stood out in the tests, providing a 40 vol% ceramic slurry with no noticeable sedimentation and viscosity of 2.3 Pa.s at 30 s-1 despite the relatively high specific surface area (15 m2/g) of the 3Y-TZP powder used compared to powders usually used for VP slurries. The adsorption of Disperbyk-111 on ceramic particles surface was investigated by FTIR. Finally, ceramic bodies were 3D printed, debound and sintered at 1500 C for 2 h, confirming the ability to manufacture detailed dense ceramic parts. © 2021 Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos.

Furthermore, the additive nature of the process makes it less accurate than subtractive processes. Hence, additive manufacturing techniques could tremendously benefit from finishing processes to improve their geometric tolerance and surface finish. Design/methodology/approach: Rotary ultrasonic machining (RUM) was chosen as a finishing operation for drilling additively manufactured carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites. Two distinct additive manufacturing methods of fused deposition modeling (FDM) and laser-assisted laminated object manufacturing (LA-LOM) were used to fabricate CFRP plates with continuous carbon fiber reinforcement. The influence of the feedrate, tool rotation speed and ultrasonic power of the RUM process parameters on the aforementioned quality characteristics revealed the feasibility of RUM process as a finishing operation for additive manufactured CFRP. Findings: The quality of drilled holes in the CFRP plates fabricated via LA-LOM was supremely superior to the FDM counterparts with less pullout delamination, smoother surface and less burr formation. The strong interfacial bonding in LA-LOM proven to be superior to FDM was able to endure higher cutting force of the RUM process. The cutting force and cutting temperature overwhelmed the FDM parts and induced higher surface damage. Originality/value: Overall, the present study demonstrates the feasibility of a hybrid additive and subtractive manufacturing method that could potentially reduce cost and waste of the CFRP production for industrial applications. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive; Additive manufacturing; Carbon fiber; Composites; Drilling; Fiber; Finishing; Laminates; Machining; Manufacturing; Surface; Surface finishing; Ultrasonic; Ultrasonic drilling","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Finishing; Fused Deposition Modeling; Graphite fibers; Infill drilling; Plates (structural components); Ultrasonic cutting; Carbon fiber composite; Carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite; Design/methodology/approach; Fused deposition modeling (FDM); Laminated object manufacturing; Manufacturing techniques; Quality characteristic; Rotary ultrasonic machining; Additives","","","","","Celanese Corporation; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA","The authors thank the support from the Kansas NASA EPSCoR Program (KNEP) Partnership Development Grant (PDG).

This paper presents physics-based simulation modelling for predicting the thermal field solution and molten pool geometry in laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) process for Ti6Al4V, SS316L, and IN625 metal powders. Two-dimensional (2D) thermal field on the powder bed surface along the laser path and the hatch direction are computed for a moving laser heat source using implicit numerical formulation to understand the temperature rise during L-PBF process. The temperature field into the powder is computed using the temperature solution obtained along the laser path. The results are compared against the literature to corroborate the computed molten pool geometry. This numerical solution approach is found to be highly practical for computing thermal fields and suitable for digital twin development in metal additive manufacturing. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Additive manufacturing; Digital twin; Finite element method; Metal; Nickel; Physics-based simulation; Powder bed fusion; Steel; Titanium","Aluminum alloys; Finite element method; Nickel; Powder metals; Selective laser melting; Titanium alloys; Fusion process; Laser paths; Laser powders; Manufacturing IS; Molten pool; Physics-based Simulation; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion; Simulation model; Thermal field; Additives","","","","","","","Abolhasani D., Seyedkashi S.M.H., Kang N., Kim Y.J., Woo Y.Y., Moon Y.H., Analysis of melt-pool behaviors during selective laser melting of AISI 304 stainless-steel composites, Metals, 9, 8, (2019); Anam M.A., Pal D., Stucker B., Modeling and experimental validation of nickel-based super alloy (Inconel 625) made using selective laser melting, Proceedings of 23rd Annual International Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium, pp. 463-473, (2013); Arisoy Y.M., Criales L.E., Ozel T., Modeling and simulation of thermal field and solidification in laser powder bed fusion of nickel alloy IN625, Optics and Laser Technology, 109, pp. 278-292, (2019); Grade 316 Stainless Steel Datasheet, (2020); Bergheau J.M., Fortunier R., Finite Element Simulation of Heat Transfer, (2008); Boivineau M., Cagran C., Doytier D., Eyraud V., Nadal M.H., Wilthan B., Pottlacher G., Thermophysical properties of solid and liquid ti-6Al-4V (TA6V) alloy, International Journal of Thermophysics, 27, 2, pp. 507-529, (2006); Criales L., Arisoy Y.M., Ozel T., Sensitivity analysis of material and process parameters in finite element modeling of selective laser melting of Inconel 625, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 86, 9-12, pp. 2653-2666, (2016); Criales L., Ozel T., Temperature profile and melt depth in laser powder bed fusion of Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy, Progress in Additive Manufacturing, 2, 3, pp. 169-177, (2017); Criales L.E., Arisoy Y.M., Lane B., Moylan S., Donmez A., Ozel T., Predictive modeling, and optimization of multi-track processing for laser powder bed fusion of nickel alloy 625, Additive Manufacturing, 13, pp. 14-36, (2017); Criales L.E., Arisoy Y.M., Lane B., Moylan S., Donmez A., Ozel T., Laser powder bed fusion of nickel alloy 625: experimental investigations of effects of process parameters on melt pool size and shape with spatter analysis, International Journal of Machine Tools and Manufacture, 121, pp. 22-36, (2017); Denlinger E.R., Jagdale V., Srinivasan G.V., El-Wardany T., Michaleris P., Thermal modeling of Inconel 718 processed with powder bed fusion and experimental validation using in situ measurements, Additive Manufacturing, 11, pp. 7-15, (2016); Fischer P., Karapatis N., Romano V., Glardon R., Weber H.P., A model for the interaction of near-infrared laser pulses with metal powders in selective laser sintering, Applied Physics A, 74, pp. 467-474, (2002); Gaikwad A., Yavari R., Montazeri M., Cole K., Bian L., Rao P., Toward the digital twin of additive manufacturing: integrating thermal simulations, sensing, and analytics to detect process faults, IISE Transactions, 52, 11, pp. 1204-1217, (2020); Gusarov A.V., Smurov I., Two-dimensional numerical modelling of radiation transfer in powder beds at selective laser melting, Applied Surface Science, 255, pp. 5595-5599, (2009); Gusarov A.V., Yadroitsev I., Bertrand Ph, Smurov I., Heat transfer modelling and stability analysis of selective laser melting, Applied Surface Science, 254, 4, pp. 975-979, (2007); Hussein A., Hao L., Yan C., Everson R., Finite element simulation of the temperature and stress fields in single layers built without-support in selective laser melting, Materials and Design, 52, pp. 638-647, (2013); Jahn M., Luttmann A., Schmidt A., Paul J., Finite element methods for problems with solid-liquid-solid phase transitions and free melt surface, Proc.

The comparative analysis was performed between two manufacturing processes using black recycled Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) pellets to evaluate the potential environmental impacts between Injection moulding and Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM). The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the Unit Process Life Cycle Inventory (UPLCI) methodology were adopted, which resulted in an impact assessment separated by operation modes and subunits of the equipment. The LCA results indicate a lower environmental impact of the FDM when the aim is to produce a batch size smaller than 14 parts. For batch sizes above 50 parts, the Injection moulding process generated less impact to the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Cumulative Energy Demand (CED). The printing stage contributed the most to generating impacts for the FDM. In the Injection moulding process, the main responsible for generating impacts were the injection phase. Mechanical tensile tests were carried out with the parts obtained by the FDM with different infills (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%), and it was observed that parts with 100% infill obtained the best relation between mechanical properties and environmental impacts. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","acrylonitrile butadiene styrene; fused deposition modelling; Sustainable production; waste electrical and electronic equipment","ABS resins; Additives; Butadiene; Deposition; Electronic Waste; Environmental technology; Fused Deposition Modeling; Global warming; Injection molding; Life cycle; Recycling; Styrene; Sustainable development; Tensile testing; Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene; Batch sizes; Comparative life cycle assessment; Conventional manufacturing; Deposition modeling; Injection molding process; Production alternatives; Recycled polymer; Sustainable production; Waste electrical and electronic equipment; Environmental impact","","","","","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (406,017/2018-2); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","Funding text 1: We would like to thank the Sinctronics Innovation Center for their openness and trust to conduct this study on their production process.

The FFF technique has been mainly used for rapid prototyping owing to the poor mechanical and geometrical properties of pure thermoplastic parts. However, both the development of new fibre-reinforced filaments with improved mechanical properties, and more accurate composite 3D printers have broadened the scope of FFF applications to functional components. FFF is a complex process with a large number of parameters influencing product quality and mechanical properties, and the effects of the combined parameters are usually difficult to evaluate. An array of parameter combinations has been analysed for improving the mechanical performance of thermoplastic parts such as layer thickness, build orientation, raster angle, raster width, air gap, infill density and pattern, fibre volume fraction, fibre layer location, fibre orientation and feed rate. This study aims to assess the effects of nozzle diameter on the mechanical performance and the geometric properties of 3D printed short carbon fibre-reinforced composites processed by the FFF technique. Design methodology approach: Tensile and three-point bending tests were performed to characterise the mechanical response of the 3D printed composite samples. The dimensional accuracy, the flatness error and surface roughness of the printed specimens were also evaluated. Moreover, manufacturing costs, which are related to printing time, were evaluated. Finally, scanning electron microscopy images of the printed samples were analysed to estimate the porosity as a function of the nozzle diameter and to justify the effect of nozzle diameter on dimensional accuracy and surface roughness. Findings: The effect of nozzle diameter on the mechanical and geometric quality of 3D printed composite samples was significant. In addition, large nozzle diameters tended to increase mechanical performance and enhance surface roughness, with a reduction in manufacturing costs. In contrast, 3D printed composite samples with small nozzle diameter exhibited higher geometric accuracy. However, the effect of nozzle diameter on the flatness error and surface roughness was of slight significance. Finally, some print guidelines are included. Originality value: The effect of nozzle diameter, which is directly related to product quality and manufacturing costs, has not been extensively studied. The presented study provides more information regarding the dependence of the mechanical, microstructural and geometric properties of short carbon fibre-reinforced nylon composite components on nozzle diameter. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Carbon fibre-reinforced composites; Dimensional accuracy; Fused filament fabrication; Mechanical characterisation; Nozzle diameter; Rapid prototyping","Bending dies; Bending tests; Errors; Fabrication; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Geometry; Graphite fibers; Mechanical properties; Nozzles; Plastics; Quality control; Rasterization; Scanning electron microscopy; Surface roughness; Carbon fibre reinforced composites; Fibre volume fraction; Functional components; Geometric properties; Mechanical performance; Parameter combination; Scanning electron microscopy image; Three-point bending test; 3D printers","","","","","Consejería de Educación, Cultura y Deportes; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF; Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha, JCCM, (PID2019-104586RB-I00, SBPLY/19/180501/000170, SBPLY/19/180501/000247); Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha, JCCM","This research was supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (Plan Estatal de Investigación Científica Técnica y de Innovación) and Consejería de Educación, Cultura y Deportes (Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha), under research grants PID2019-104586RB-I00, SBPLY/19/180501/000247 and SBPLY/19/180501/000170, co-financed by the ERDF (European Regional Development Fund).

To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the most comprehensive and complete SPH model for LAAM simulations to date. Major and important underlying physical processes are considered in the model. These include the transient powder–laser interaction, heat transfer, formation and dynamics of the melt-pool, powder-melt-pool interaction, and the phase change. The model is validated for many individual processes. These validation results show that the model is stable, accurate and promising for simulations of complete LAAM processes.

In conjunction with its growing applications, the mechanical behavior of the FDM printed part needs thorough investigation for effective application as an end use functional part in various industries such as aerospace, automobile, mold and die, biomedical. Functional applications of FDM printed parts are affected due to their lower mechanical properties compared to injection molded parts. The assessment of the mechanical behavior of the FDM printed part is proved as challenging task due to the wide variety of the process parameters. In the present work, an attempt has been made to experimentally investigate the tensile behavior of FDM printed parts having multi-Infill patterns and different stacking of layer arrangements for different Infill density and raster orientations. Combined patterned parts are printed from two thermoplastic materials, viz. PLA and ABS having six different stacking sequences at three different levels of Infill density (i.e., 30%, 60% and 90%) and two different raster arrangements (i.e., 0° and 45°) and those are mechanically tested to obtain tensile properties. Further, the fractographic analysis was carried out to study various aspects of tensile failure modes for FDM printed multi-infill pattern samples. Combining two different infill patterns and layer stacking sequence improves tensile strength for 45° raster orientation samples and decreases tensile strength for 0° raster orientation samples when compared to a single pattern throughout. For 0° raster orientation, stacking sequence with all the layers are deposited parallel to loading direction offers more strength than multi-infill pattern samples. Whereas for 45° raster orientation, stacking sequence with all the layers parallel to loading direction offers lower strength than multi-infill pattern samples. © 2021, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.","Fused deposition modeling;

Design/methodology/approach: A total of eight existing and newly proposed analytical models, tailored to satisfy the structural behaviour of FDM parts, are evaluated in terms of their capability to predict the ultimate tensile stress (UTS) and the elastic modulus (E) of parts made of polylactic acid (PLA) by the FDM process. This evaluation is made by comparing the structural properties predicted by these models with the experimental results obtained from tensile tests on FDM specimens fabricated with variable infill percentage, perimeter layers and build orientation. Findings: Some analytical models are able to predict with high accuracy (prediction errors smaller than 5%) the structural behaviour of FDM and categories of similar additive manufactured parts. The most accurate model is Gibson’s and Ashby, followed by the efficiency model and the two new proposed exponential and variant Duckworth models. Research limitations/implications: The study has been limited to uniaxial loading conditions along three different build orientations. Practical implications: The structural properties of FDM parts can be predicted by analytical models based on the process parameters and material properties. Product engineers can use these models during the design for the additive manufacturing process. Originality/value: Existing methods to estimate the structural properties of FDM parts are based on experimental tests; however, such methods are time-consuming and costly. In this work, the use of analytical models to predict the structural properties of FDM parts is proposed and evaluated. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Analytical models; Fused deposition modelling (FDM); Material extrusion; Prediction performance; Structural properties","Additives; Deposition; Design for manufacturability; Forecasting; Fused Deposition Modeling; Product design; Structural properties; Tensile testing; Additive manufacturing process; Design/methodology/approach; Experimental test; Fused deposition modelling; Mechanical behaviour; Process parameters; Structural behaviour; Ultimate tensile stress; Analytical models","","","","","National Science and Technology Council; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT, (CB-2010-01-154430)","The authors would like to thank the financial support from the National Science and Technology Council (CONACYT) of Mexico, grant number CB-2010-01-154430.

The finite element analysis (FEA) method was validated beforehand in experimental work with lattice structure fabricated using fused deposition modeling (FDM) additive manufacturing (AM). From the comparison, good agreement was achieved with less than 11% error. From numerical results, it was found the stiffness values decrease with strut diameter from 1.8 mm to 1.0 mm. The first three vibration modes show steady increment around 12 Hz, 20 Hz, and 70 Hz in natural frequency respectively for acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) material and roughly 35 Hz, 60 Hz, and 200 Hz for both stainless steel and titanium as the strut diameter increase by 0.2 mm each.

As a branch of MLPBF, multi-laser array powder bed fusion (MLA-PBF) has gradually attracted the attention of the industry, because of its advantages such as significantly speeding up production efficiency and low technical implementation difficulty. However, there is currently a lack of simulation studies based on the mesoscopic scale to describe the dynamic behavior of the MLA-PBF molten pool. The MLA-PBF spreading powder process was calculated herein based on the open source DEM framework Yade, the MLA-PBF molten pool dynamics was described based on the open source CFD framework OpenFOAM, and a multi-laser heat source model for real-time tracking of changes in the metal-phase and gas-phase interface was proposed. Aiming at the single-line mode of MLA-PBF, it was found that the dual-laser forming with low-front and high-rear could be used to preheat and pre-sinter the metal particles that were about to enter the molten pool, which was beneficial to reduce the pore defect in the solidified track, and a moderate laser beam space should be used. Aiming at the multi-line mode of MLA-PBF, it could form a molten pool with a significantly larger width and length than in the case of a single-laser beam, which was beneficial to eliminate pore defect in the formed zone, obtain a flat solidified track surface, and improve forming efficiency. When the laser power was low or the laser beam space was large, a large number of pores were prone to appear in the formed zone. As the laser power increased or the laser beam space decreased, when the laser energy was sufficient to melt the metal particles located in the lower part of the powder bed, a smooth surface of the solidified track and fewer pore defect would be obtained. This paper is expected to provide theoretical support for deepening the application of MLA-PBF in metal additive manufacturing. © 2020, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.","","3D printers; Forming; Laser beams; Metals; Phase interfaces; Powder metals; Dynamic behaviors; Laser heat sources; Numerical investigations; Production efficiency; Rapid manufacturing; Real time tracking; Simulation studies; Technical implementation; Laser applications","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2019A1515012040)","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (No. 2019A1515012040).

Additive systems that employ vat photopolymerisation such as stereolithography (SLA) and digital light projection are used widely in the field of biomedical science and engineering. However, additive manufacturing methods can be limited by the types of materials that can be used. In this study, we present an isosorbide-based formulation for a polymer resin yielding a range of elastic moduli between 1.7 and 3 GN mm-2 dependent on the photoinitiator system used as well as the amount of calcium phosphate filler added. The monomer was prepared and enhanced for 3D-printing using an SLA technique that delivered stable and optimized 3D-printed models. The resin discussed could potentially be used following major surgery for the correction of congenital defects, the removal of oral tumours and the reconstruction of the head and neck region. The surgeon is usually limited with devices available to restore both function and appearance and with the ever-increasing demand for low-priced and efficient facial implants, there is an urgent need to advance new manufacturing approaches and implants with a higher osseointegration performance. © 2020 The Author(s).

Use additive manufacturing and silicone moulds for converting three-dimensional samples into limestone mortar with white Portland cement substrates for coral growth. Design/methodology/approach: Tiles samples were designed and printed with different geometries and textures inspired by nature marine environment. Commercial coral frag tiles were analysed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to identify the main chemical elements. Raw materials and coral species were selected. New base substrates were manufactured and deployed into a closed-circuit aquarium to monitor the coral weekly evolution process and analyse the results obtained. Findings: Experimental results provided positive statistical parameters for future implementation tests, concluding that the intensity of textured surface, interfered favourably in the coralline algae biofilm growth. The chemical composition and design of the substrates were determinant factors for successful coral propagation. Recesses and cavities mimic the natural rocks aspect and promoted the presence and interaction of other species that favour the richness of the ecosystem. Originality/value: Additive manufacturing provided an innovative method of production for ecology restoration areas, allowing rapid prototyping of substrates with high complexity morphologies, a critical and fundamental attribute to guarantee coral growth and Crustose Coralline Algae. The result of this study showed the feasibility of this approach using three-dimensional printing technologies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing; Artificial reef; Coral propagation; Design; Limestone substrates; Portland cement mortar","Additives; Algae; Cement industry; Cement manufacture; Chemical elements; Ecology; Fisheries; Lime; Morphology; Portland cement; Reefs; Scanning electron microscopy; Silicones; Substrates; Surface morphology; Textures; Chemical compositions; Crustose coralline algae; Design/methodology/approach; Determinant factors; Fundamental attributes; Morphology and composition; Statistical parameters; White portland cements; 3D printers","","","","","","","Andrade G., Biomimética no design: abordagens, limitações e contribuções Para o desenvolvimento de produtos e tecnologias.

Bonded permanent magnets (PMs) have been produced via several AM techniques to allow for rapid manufacture of complex geometries. These magnets, however, tend to suffer from lower residual induction than the industry standard of injection moulding primarily due to the lower packing density of the magnetic particles and secondly due to the feedstock consisting of neodymium-iron-boron (Nd-Fe-B) powder with isotropic magnetic properties. As there is no compaction during most AM processes, increasing the packing density is very difficult and therefore the purpose of this study was to increase the magnetic properties of the PMs without increasing the part density. Design/methodology/approach: Accordingly, this research investigates the use of anisotropic NdFeB feedstock coupled with an in-situ alignment fixture into an AM process known as selective laser sintering (SLS) to increase the magnetic properties of AM magnets. A Helmholtz coil array was added to an SLS machine and used to expose each powder layer during part fabrication to a near-uniform magnetic field of 20.4 mT prior to consolidation by the laser. Findings: Permeagraph measurements of the parts showed that the alignment field introduced residual induction anisotropy of up to 46.4 ± 2.2% when measured in directions parallel and perpendicular to the alignment field. X-ray diffraction measurements also demonstrated a convergence of the orientation of the crystals when the magnets were processed in the presence of the alignment field. Originality/value: A novel active alignment fixture for SLS was introduced and was experimentally shown to induce anisotropy in bonded PMs. Thus demonstrating a new method for the enhancement in energy density of PMs produced via AM methods. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Active magnetic field; Additive manufacturing; Anisotropy; Binder; Composite materials; Functional materials; Hard magnetic materials; Material properties","Alignment; Anisotropy; Crystal orientation; Feedstocks; Fixtures (tooling); Injection molding; Iron alloys; Laser heating; Magnetic properties; Magnetism; Neodymium alloys; Permanent magnets; Sintering; Design/methodology/approach; Industry standards; Neodymium iron borons; Permanent magnets (PMs); Residual induction; Selective laser sintering(SLS); Uniform magnetic fields; X-ray diffraction measurements; Selective laser sintering","","","","","National Heart Foundation of Australia; Prince Charles Hospital Foundation, (102062, NI2017-28, RF2018-04, TM2017-04); Prince Charles Hospital Foundation","This work was supported by the Prince Charles Hospital Foundation, Brisbane, Australia [NI2017-28, TM2017-04].

In this study, a three dimensional numerical model is developed to model the thermal-fluid flow and to predict the surface morphology for the SLM process. Particularly the laser ray tracing method is coupled with the VOF method to reproduce the multiple reflections of laser between the randomly packed powder particles and highly dynamic molten pool. Two sets of experiments are used to validate the model: 1) single tracks on a bare plate with different scan strategies, and 2) single tracks on a powder layer with different scan speeds. For the bare-plate single tracks, the width and surface elevation, including their variation along the track distance, are well reproduced in the simulations. For the powder-layer single tracks, the experimentally-observed balling, distributed and smooth tracks with varied scan speeds are all reproduced in the simulations. The results illustrate the complex flow pattern of the molten pool, particularly the effect of partially melted particles: 1) the semi-melted particles, drive the molten fluid flow from the molten pool center towards the unmelted particle, leading to the single track non-uniformity; 2) the near-fully melted particles, drive the molten fluid flow down into the melt pool, increasing the single track uniformity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Experimental validation; Numerical modeling; Ray tracing; Selective laser melting; Stainless steel; Surface morphology","Flow patterns; Mass transfer; Melting; Morphology; Numerical models; Ray tracing; Surface morphology; Additive manufacturing technology; Fully melted particles; Heat and mass transfer; Multiple reflections; Ray-tracing method; Selective laser melting (SLM); Three-dimensional numerical modeling; Unmelted particles; Selective laser melting","","","","","","","Ge W., Guo C., Lin F., Microstructures of components synthesized via electron beam selective melting using blended pre-alloyed powders of ti6al4v and ti45al7nb, Rare Metal Mater.

Klong-Luang District, Pathum Thani, 13180, Thailand","Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) or Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) or three-dimension (3D) printing are rapid prototyping processes for workpieces. There are many factors which have a significant effect on surface quality, including bed temperature, printing speed, and layer thickness. This empirical study was conducted to determine the relationship between the above-mentioned factors and average surface roughness (Ra). Workpieces of cylindrical shape were fabricated by an FFF system with a Polylactic acid (PLA) filament. The surface roughness was measured at five different positions on the bottom and top surface. A response surface (Box-Behnken) method was utilised to design the experiment and statistically predict the response. The total number of treatments was sixteen, while five measurements (Ra1, Ra2, Ra3, Ra4 and Ra5) were carried out for each treatment. The settings of each factor were as follows: bed temperature (80, 85, and 90 °C), printing speed (40, 80 and 120 mm/s), and layer thickness (0.10, 0.25 and 0.40 mm). The prediction equation of surface roughness was then derived from the analysis. The same set of data was also used as the inputs for a machine learning method, an artificial neural network (ANN), to construct the prediction equation of surface roughness. Rectified linear unit (ReLU) was utilised as the activation function of ANN. Two training algorithms (resilient backpropagation with weight backtracking and globally convergent resilient backpropagation) were applied to train multi-layer perceptrons. Moreover, the different number of neurons in each hidden layer was also studied and compared. Another interesting aspect of this study is that the ANN was based on a limited number of training samples. Finally, the prediction errors of each method were compared, to benchmark the prediction performance of the two methods: Box-Behnken and ANN.  © K.

Metal parts were fabricated by means of a low-cost FDM machine with a filament composed of 316 L stainless steel particles and polymeric binder mixture, followed by debinding and sintering treatments. The objective of the study is to investigate the possible influence of some relevant FDM printing parameters on dimensional shrinkage and bulk density of the metal samples. The experimental analysis was conducted by means of a statistical method (ANOVA). Besides, a porosity evaluation was carried out to identify the real density values and the amount of opened and closed porosities of samples characterized with highest and lowest bulk density. Lines infill pattern, extrusion speed set to 20 mm/s and 0.1 mm as layer thickness was the combination of process parameters that ensured the highest nominal density (i.e. 95% of the monolithic 316 L nominal density). The statistical analysis did not show any effects due to the nozzle temperature on the bulk density. X and Y shrinkages settled around 16%, while shrinkages along Z-axis showed a greater variability. The samples with the worst bulk density showed a higher percentage of opened porosity, while the percentage of opened porosity for samples with the best combination of process parameters resulted less than 3%. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.","additive; aisi 316l; density; FDM; filament; metal; processability; shrinkage; stainless steel; ultrafuse","3D printers; Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Frequency division multiplexing; Metals; Porosity; Sintering; Density value; Experimental analysis; Extrusion speed; Metal additives; Nozzle temperature; Polymeric binder; Process parameters; Sintering treatment; Shrinkage","","","","","","","ISO/ASTM 52900:2015(E) Standard Terminology for Additive Manufacturing, (2015); Jirsak P., Brunet-Thornton R., Perspectives of Operational Additive Manufacturing Case Studies from the Czech Aerospace Industry, J.

The efficiency of the thermoelectric module has not been fully explored due to the drawbacks in conventional design and fabrication methods. Selective laser melting (SLM) additive manufacturing offers a unique potential scalable approach for the fabrication of flexible and functionally graded thermoelectric materials with high energy conversion efficiency. In this paper, we developed a physical model to simulate the SLM manufacturing process of thermoelectric materials (Mg2Si powders) with additive material (Si) mixed for better thermoelectric performance. A comprehensive thermal and fluid study of the SLM manufacturing was conducted to understand the phenomena associated with the melting and solidification processes in the melting pool. This physical model was established based on the conservation equations and provided a basis to study the fluid flow driven by the buoyancy force and surface tension in the melting pool. Using this model, the influences of the process parameters, such as laser scanning speed and power energy density, on the temperature distribution, powder bed shrinkage, pool size, and particle aggregation in the powder bed, were studied, which provided critical information for understanding SLM for thermoelectric device fabrication. © 2020","Material processing; Numerical simulation; Powder bed fusion; Selective laser melting; Thermoelectric","Additives; Agglomeration; Conversion efficiency; Flow of fluids; Functionally graded materials; Lakes; Magnesium compounds; Melting; Powders; Selective laser melting; Silicon; Silicon compounds; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectricity; High energy conversions; Melting and solidification; Selective laser melting (SLM); Temperature differences; Thermo-Electric materials; Thermo-electric modules; Thermoelectric generators; Thermoelectric performance; Thermoelectric energy conversion","","","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (16–10884); National Science Foundation, NSF, (1915946)","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the US National Science Foundation via Grant #1915946 and the U.S. Department of Energy via Grant #16\u201310884.","Rowe D.M., Thermoelectrics Handbook: Macro to Nano, (2005); Kruth J.P., Mercelis P., Van Vaerenbergh J., Froyen L., Rombouts M., Binding mechanisms in selective laser sintering and selective laser melting, Rapid Prototyp.

In this work, a novel micro-additive manufacturing technique, selective laser melting ink-printed (SLM-IP) copper (Cu) nanoparticles (NPs) method, was developed to fabricate Cu protruded microtextures on stainless steel surface. The physical effects of texture geometry parameters on the hydrodynamic lubrication performance were investigated by theoretical calculation and experiments. The theoretical results indicated that the triangle-shaped microtexture exhibited better hydrodynamic effects compared to circular and square-shaped ones. The use of a complicated ring structure resulted in a noticeable increase in hydrodynamic pressure. For each individual shape, the friction coefficient was measured and calculated as a function of texture area or radius ratio. The experimental results, supported by the theoretical analysis, provides evidence that the protruded surface microtexture fabricated by SLM-IP Cu NPs helped improve the tribological performance. The geometric parameters of the protruded microtexture’s size should be taken into account for the optimum size of texture structure. Furthermore, the operating condition of the protruded surface texture were evaluated. A transition point of sliding speed and load existed between mixed and hydrodynamic lubrication regimes. This study suggests that the SLM-IP Cu NPs method is a promising approach for friction reduction surface microtexture manufacturing. © 2021 Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers.","Friction reduction;

Alloying with Mn evidently influenced the grain size, hardness, and biodegradation behavior. On the other hand, increasing Mn content to 0.8 wt% resulted in a decrease of biodegradation rate which is attributed to the decreased grain size and relatively protective surface layer of manganese oxide. Higher Mn contents increased the biodegradation rate attributed to the presence of the Mn-rich particles. Taken together, ZK30-0.2Cu-0.8Mn exhibited the lowest biodegradation rate, strong antibacterial performance, and good cytocompatibility. © 2020 Xie, et al.

This paper presents a methodology to describe the dynamic characteristics of FDM, combining the features of thermoplastic material and build parameters adopted in fabrication. The viscoelastic characteristics of thermoplastic filament induce time–temperature dependence in FDM components. The viscoelastic characteristic of the polymer is determined by dynamical mechanical analysis. Layer height is a significant build parameter that determines void geometry even in 100% infill printing, that influences mechanical properties of these additive manufactured components. Dynamic response of FDM 3D-printed parts is highly dependent on viscoelastic characteristics of polymer filaments and build parameters associated with printing. In the study, micro-scale models representing the features of actual cross section morphology with different layer heights are identified as representative volume element (RVE) models. Harmonic analysis is conducted on the RVE models using polymer material data approximated with generalized Maxwell model to determine the dynamic characteristics of the FDM print. The numerical analysis reveals orthotropic viscoelastic nature with maximum stiffness along the direction of filament deposition (raster) direction followed by transverse and vertical directions. A drastic reduction in the FDM component stiffness was observed at lower straining rates. The characteristics determined on RVE can be homogenized to the entire structure based on its print conditions and can be used for designing functional components. © 2021, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.","Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA); Fused deposition modelling (FDM); Homogenization; Representative volume element (RVE); Viscoelastic","Additives; Deposition; Dynamic response; Fused Deposition Modeling; Numerical analysis; Polymers; Reinforced plastics; Stiffness; Temperature distribution; Viscoelasticity; Cross-section morphology; Dynamic characteristics; Dynamical mechanical analysis; Functional applications; Fused deposition modelling; Generalized Maxwell model; Representative volume element (RVE); Visco-elastic characteristics; Dynamics","","","","","","","Mohan N., Senthil P., Vinodh S., Jayanth N., A review on composite materials and process parameters optimisation for the fused deposition modelling process, Virtual Phys Prototyp, 2759, pp. 47-59, (2017); Yang C., Wang B., Li D., Tian X., Modelling and characterisation for the responsive performance of CF/PLA and CF/PEEK smart materials fabricated by 4D printing, Virtual Phys Prototyp, 12, pp. 69-76, (2017); Miyase A., Qu S., Lo K.H., Wang S.S., Elevated-temperature thermal expansion of PTFE/PEEK matrix composite with random-oriented short carbon fibers and graphite flakes, J Eng Mater Technol, 142, pp. 1-10, (2020); Isakov D.V., Lei Q., Castles F., Stevens C.J., Grovenor C.R.M., Grant P.S., 3D printed anisotropic dielectric composite with meta-material features, Mater Des, 93, pp. 423-430, (2016); Sathies T., Senthil P., Prakash C., Application of 3D printed PLA-carbon black conductive polymer composite in solvent sensing, Mater Res Express, 6, (2019); Jayanth N., Senthil P., Application of 3D printed ABS based conductive carbon black composite sensor in void fraction measurement, Compos Part B, 159, pp. 224-230, (2019); Schmitz D.P., Ecco L.G., Dul S., Pereira E.C.L., Soares B.G., Barra G.M.O., Pegoretti A., Electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness of ABS carbon-based composites manufactured via fused deposition modelling, Mater Today Commun, 15, pp. 70-80, (2018); Sathies T., Senthil P., Anoop M.S., A review on advancements in applications of fused deposition modelling process, Rapid Prototyp J, (2020); Somireddy M., Singh C.V., Czekanski A., Mechanical behaviour of 3D printed composite parts with short carbon fiber reinforcements, Eng Fail Anal, 107, pp. 1-13, (2020); Huang B., Singamneni S., Raster angle mechanics in fused deposition modelling, J Compos Mater, 49, pp. 363-383, (2015); Croccolo D., De Agostinis M., Olmi G., Experimental characterization and analytical modelling of the mechanical behaviour of fused deposition processed parts made of ABS-M30, Comput Mater Sci, 79, pp. 506-518, (2013); Dizon J.R.C., Espera A.H., Chen Q., Advincula R.C., Review mechanical characterization of 3D-printed polymers, Addit.

Design/methodology/approach: Eight current filaments for FDM from six polymeric materials have been characterized to determine their suitability for restoration and conservation treatments. For testing these filaments, specimens are printed with acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene; polylactic acid; polylactic acid with CaCO3 (E.P.); polyethylene terephthalate glycol; polypropylene; and high-impact polystyrene. Suitability of a filament was verified using the Oddy test by detecting the action of volatile pollutants released from the filaments. The morphological and color changes were observed after allowing them to degrade under the exposure of UV radiation. The samples were then analyzed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. In addition, gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy technique was applied to complete the characterization of the printed filaments. Findings: Materials investigated are suitable for restoration purposes ensuring long-term stability. Rapid prototyping using FDM is appropriate for restoring sensitive archaeological objects allowing reconstruction of parts and decreasing risk while manipulating delicate artifacts. Originality/value: Rapid prototyping using FDM was chosen for the restoration of a fragile and sensitive archaeological glass bowl from Manises Ceramic Museum. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Archaeological objects; Conservation of glass; Rapid prototyping; Restoration; Stability","Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Fused Deposition Modeling; Gas chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Phosphorus compounds; Plastic bottles; Polyesters; Polymer blends; Polypropylene oxides; Polypropylenes; Rapid prototyping; Restoration; Styrene; Uranium metallography; Vanadium metallography; Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene; Conservation treatment; Design/methodology/approach; Fused deposition modeling (FDM); Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopies; High impact polystyrene; Polyethylene terephthalate glycols; Three-dimensional (3D) printing; Image reconstruction","","","","","Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras, FEDER; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO; Universitat de València, 85|86; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (HAR2015-69408-R); Ministerio de Asuntos Económicos y Transformación Digital, Gobierno de España, MINECO","Funding text 1: This work is supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), in the context of the research project “Desarrollo de un Sistema Integrado de Restauración, Recomposición, Restitución y Representación de Fragmentos Arqueológicos”: HAR2015-69408-R (MINECO-FEDER).; Funding text 2: The authors want to express their gratitude to Mr Antonio Doménech from the Universitat de València for Chemical characterization using FT-IR spectroscopy and gas chromatography spectroscopy techniques.

In addition, there are limited ISO/ASTM standards on the post-processing of metal AM components. Considerable efforts have been made to close these current gaps and challenges for standardization. In this review, First, all the existing ISO/ASTM standards under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee F42 on additive manufacturing technologies are briefly discussed. Second, two of the most promising additive manufacturing processes: powder bed fusion (PBF) and directed energy deposition (DED), as well as their common defects of AM components, are thoroughly reviewed. The build quality, surface finish characteristics, and dimensional integrity of the as-built AM components are still not satisfactory (i.e., Ra > 5 µm and Rz > 100 µm). Third, the review is focused on identifying potential solutions to surface-finish complex additive manufactured geometries and reduce the surface roughness to meet the industry requirements (i.e., Ra < 1 µm and Rz < 20 µm). Current state-of-the-art surface finishing techniques, their material removal mechanisms, process parameters, advantages, and limitations to post-process PBF components are discussed. The technical gaps and future perspectives in enhancing the surface quality of AM components are outlined. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; directed energy deposition; external surface finishing; internal surface finishing; ISO/ASTM standards; powder bed fusion","3D printers; Additives; ASTM standards; Finishing; Surface roughness; Surface treatment; Additive manufacturing process; Additive manufacturing technology; Dimensional integrity; Future perspectives; Industry requirements; ISO/ASTM standard; Material removal mechanisms; Process parameters; ISO Standards","","","","","National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF, (IAF Mantech 1.1); National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF","Funding text 1: This work was performed within the Rolls-Royce @ NTU Corporate Lab with support from the National Research Foundation (NRF) of Singapore under the Corp Lab @ University Scheme.

Digital light processing (DLP) has recently emerged as a fast growing 3D printing technique due to its high resolution and high speed. However, the lack of printable high-performance materials limits its broad applications. In addition, with the increasing adoption of DLP 3D printing, the efficient recycling of printed thermosetting materials is highly desired. Herein, we proposed a two-stage curing approach involving dynamic reactions by using the acrylate-epoxy hybrid resin for the recyclable DLP 3D printing of high-performance thermosetting polymers. Bond exchange reactions (BERs) could establish covalent bonds between the acrylate network and the epoxy network, thus partially triggering the copolymerization. The resulting new polymers exhibited excellent mechanical properties. A small-molecule assisted BER method was then used to efficiently depolymerize the thermosetting printed parts into soluble oligomers, which were formulated with fresh photopolymers for the next round of printing. The reprinted samples still showed good mechanical properties comparable to the virgin ones. In addition, the new polymers demonstrated potential applications in 4D printing of smart actuators. This work opens a novel avenue for green manufacturing technologies. © 2020 The Authors","3D printing; Bond exchange reactions (BERs); Recycle; Reprint","Green manufacturing; Mechanical properties; Photopolymers; Thermosets; Broad application; Digital light processing; Dynamic reactions; Efficient recycling; High performance material; Manufacturing technologies; Thermosetting materials; Thermosetting polymers; 3D printers","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11732012); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","The work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 11732012 ).

Although Young’s modulus of NiTi is relatively low, it still needs to be reduced; one of the promising ways is by introducing porous structure. Traditional manufacturing processes, such as casting, can hardly produce complex porous structures. Additive manufacturing (AM) is one of the most advanced manufacturing technologies that can solve impurity issues, and selective laser melting (SLM) is one of the well-known methods. This paper reviews the developments of AM-NiTi with a particular focus on SLM-NiTi utilization in biomedical applications. Correspondingly, this paper aims to describe the three key factors, including powder preparation, processing parameters, and gas atmosphere during the overall process of porous NiTi. The porous structure design is of vital importance, so the unit cell and pore parameters are discussed. The mechanical properties of SLM-NiTi, such as hardness, compressive strength, tensile strength, fatigue behavior, and damping properties and their relationship with design parameters are summarized. In the end, it points out the current challenges. Considering the increasing application of NiTi implants, this review paper may open new frontiers for advanced and modern designs. © 2021 Zhang Y, et al.

Using the formulations which provide polylactic acid (PLA) improved thermo-mechanical properties and desired dimensional stability, the new materials were shaped, on a laboratory line, as filaments for printing technology. The selected compounds were than scaled up on a 50 kg/h compounding line into granules which prove to have good shapability as filaments for printing technology (1.85 +/- 0.05 mm diameter, required ovality, good appearance and smooth surface) and performed properly at 3D printing. The obtained results proved that functional properties of PLA can be improved by various methods so that, depending on the reached performances, the new material can be converted through printing technology into items for performance applications. The novelty of the article is related to the fact that it identifies a modifying solution for controlling the morphology of a type of PLA designed for 3D printing that already has an advanced crystallinity. © 2021 Materiale Plastice.

However, no unified information model has been developed to represent specific manufacturing process in 3D printing. This work therefore proposes a STEP/STEP-NC-compliant process data model to define specific application objects and entities, to model manufacturing data relationships and constraints, and to standardize process parameters through extended 3D printing concepts in fused deposition modelling (FDM). This data model describes manufacturing layers, deposition operations and process parameters in the context of the digital thread. As a special feature, manufacturing layers provide geometric information to layered operations based on STEP/STEP-NC standards for additive manufacturing (AM). Deposition operations specify the definitions of print devices or headers, header paths, FDM technology and functions, and even deposition strategy. Process parameters mainly provide process information in the FDM process. Finally, a conformance testing process is developed, focussed on manufacturing layers and header paths and by means of information exchange. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd. part of Springer Nature.","Additive manufacturing; Data model; Digital thread; Fused deposition Modelling; Standardization","Deposition; Fused Deposition Modeling; Machining; Advanced manufacturing; Fused deposition modelling; Geometric information; Information exchanges; Information Modeling; Manufacturing informations; Manufacturing parameters; Manufacturing process; Three dimensional computer graphics","","","","","China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201504490035)","PhD grant of Dr. Jinhua Xiao has been funded by the China Scholarship Council under the ID 201504490035.

The main goal was to compare the strength and hardness of samples produced in various media in order to analyse the applicability of the 3D printing technology as an alternative method of producing wax injection dies. To make the wax injection dies, it was decided to use a milled steel and 3D printed inserts made using FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) / FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) technology from HIPS (High Impact Polystyrene) and ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene). A semi-Automatic vertical reciprocating injection moulding machine was used to produce the wax samples made of Freeman Flakes Wax Mixture Super Pink. During injection moulding process, the mould temperature was measured each time before and after moulding with a pyrometer. Then, the samples were subjected to a static tensile test and a hardness test. It was shown that the mould material influences the strength properties of the wax samples, but not their final hardness. © 2021 Polish Academy of Sciences.

The main advantages of this method over conventional methods include that it is faster and produces less material waste. Besides, AM offers computer-aided design and manufacturing but does not include any limitations on the product's geometry and does not require any extra tools. End milling is a conventional manufacturing process used for profiling, slotting, and facing. In this study, at the point of overcoming the weaknesses of AM surface quality, it was investigated whether the cast polymer's surface quality could be reached with hybrid manufacturing (AM + milling). For this reason, the parts produced by FDM were subjected to end milling, and the effect of cutting depth, feed rate, and rotation speed on surface quality and chip type were investigated. The results obtained are compared with the results of the milling operation of cast polyamide. For all results, surface quality increases with a rising feed rate. In general, the surface quality obtained by milling parts produced using FDM is low, but each manufacturing technique is affected differently by the end milling conditions. Low rotation speed and high feed rates should be preferred to obtain the desired surface quality from FDM printed polyamide parts. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","3D printing; additive manufacturing; chip type; end milling; Polyamide; surface quality","Additives; Computer aided design; Deposition; Fused Deposition Modeling; Machine design; Milling (machining); Product design; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Chip types; Conventional methods; Deposition modeling; End milling; Feedrate; Machining parameters; Manufacturing techniques; Rotation speed; Surface properties","","","","","","","Abdullah A.M., Rahim T.N.A.T., Mohamad D., Akil H.M., Rajion Z.A., Mechanical and physical properties of highly ZrO2/β-TCP filled polyamide 12 prepared via fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printer for potential craniofacial reconstruction application, Materials Letters, 189, pp. 307-309, (2017); ASM Handbook Machining, (1989); Bozdemir M., Prediction of surface roughness considering cutting parameters and humidity condition in end milling of polyamide materials, Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2018, (2018); Crespo M., Gomez-del Rio M.T., Rodriguez J., Failure of SLS polyamide 12 notched samples at high loading rates, Theoretical and Applied Fracture Mechanics, 92, pp. 233-239, (2017); Dechet M.A., Goblirsch A., Romeis S., Zhao M., Lanyi F.J., Kaschta J., Schubert D.W., Drummer D., Peukert W., Schmidt J., Production of polyamide 11 microparticles for Additive Manufacturing by liquid-liquid phase separation and precipitation, Chemical Engineering Science, 197, pp. 11-25, (2019); Farahnakian M., Razfar M.R., Moghri M., Asadnia M., The selection of milling parameters by the PSO-based neural network modeling method, The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 57, 1-4, pp. 49-60, (2011); Garcia R., Prabhakar P., Bond interface design for single lap joints using polymeric additive manufacturing, Composite Structures, 176, pp. 547-555, (2017); Goodridge R.D., Tuck C.J., Hague R.J.M., Laser sintering of polyamides and other polymers, Progress in Materials Science, 57, 2, pp. 229-267, (2012); Justo J., Tavara L., Guzman L.G., Paris F., Characterization of 3D printed long fibre reinforced composites, Composite Structures, 185, pp. 537-548, (2018); Kalla D., Ahmad J.S., Twomey J., Prediction of cutting forces in helical end milling fiber reinforced polymers, International Journal of Machine Tools and Manufacture, 50, 10, pp. 882-891, (2010); Karpat Y., Polat N., Mechanistic force modeling for milling of carbon fiber reinforced polymers with double helix tools, CIRP Annals Manufacturing Annals, 62, 1, pp. 95-98, (2013); Keresztes R., Odrobina M., Nagarajan R., Subramanian K., Kalacska G., Sukumaran J., Tribological characteristics of cast polyamide 6 (PA6G) matrix and their composite under normal and overload conditions using dynamic pin-on-plate system, Composites Part B: Engineering, 160, pp. 119-130, (2019); Kuram E., Micro-machinability of injection molded polyamide 6 polymer and glass-fiber reinforced polyamide 6 composite, Composites Part B: Engineering, 88, pp. 85-100, (2016); Lai C.C., Chen S.Y., Chen M.H., Chen H.L., Hsiao H.T., Liu L.C., Chen C.M., Preparation and characterization of heterocyclic polyamide 6 (PA 6) with high transparencies and low hygroscopicities, Journal of Molecular Structure, 1175, pp. 836-843, (2019); Le Duigou A., Barbe A., Guillou E., Castro M., 3D Printing of continuous flax fibre reinforced biocomposites for structural applications, Materials & Design, 180, (2019); Moghri M., Madic M., Omidi M., Farahnakian M., Surface roughness optimization of polyamide-6/nanoclay nanocomposites using artificial neural network: genetic algorithm approach, The Scientific World Journal, (2014); Monkova K., Monka P.P., Sekerakova A., Hruzik L., Burecek A., Urban M., Comparative study of chip formation in orthogonal and oblique slow-rate machining of EN 16MnCr5 Steel, Metals, 9, 6, (2019); Patel Y., The Machining of Polymers, (2008); Paulo Davim J., Silva L.R., Festas A., Abrao A.M., Machinability study on precision turning of PA66 polyamide with and without glass fiber reinforcing, Materials & Design, 30, 2, pp. 228-234, (2009); Rubio J.C.C., Silva L.J., Leite W.O., Panzera T.H., Filho S.L.M.R., Davim J.P., Investigations on the drilling process of unreinforced and reinforced polyamides using Taguchi method, Composites Part B: Engineering, 55, pp. 338-344, (2013); Tezel T., Comparison of hole quality of polyamide materials produced by traditional and additive manufacturing, International Journal of Advances in Engineering and Pure Sciences, 32, 1, pp. 1-7, (2020); Uysal A., Dzhemilov E., Dzhemalyadinov R., The influence of milling parameters on cutting forces in high-speed milling of polymer materials, Advances in Design, Simulation and Manufacturing III.

This technology requires a step of resin removal and densification by sintering to obtain a metal part. This process has been applied to copper. Photocurable formulations with a high loading rate of copper powder of 60 vol.% were developed and suitable for DLP printing with thicknesses > 25 µm. Debinding and sintering cycles were investigated on specimens fast cured by gamma irradiation to save materials and time. A debinding in air at 400 °C and sintering in hydrogen lead to a C content of 0.018 wt.%, similar to the raw copper powder and slightly higher oxygen content. The low thermal conductivity of 250 W·m−1·K−1 highlighted the harmful effect of phosphorus from the powder and photoinitiators such as BAPO.

In powder bed fusion (PBF)-type AM, crystallographic texture can be controlled by scanning strategies of energy beam. To optimize microstructures, computer simulations for predicting microstructures play very important roles. In this work, we have developed simulation programs to explain the mechanism of the crystal orientation control. First, we simulated the shape of melt pool by analyzing the heat transfer using apparent heat conductivity when the penetration of laser beam through keyholes was taken into consideration because of the evaporation and accompanying convections. It was assumed that the primary crystal growth direction can be determined by the temperature gradient, and the crystals grow keeping the growth direction as generally recognized. The shapes of simulated melt pools agree well with experimental observations. The modified cellular automaton simulations successfully reproduced two typical textures with different preferential orientations along the building directions of (100) and (110) when the bidirectional scanning with and without a rotation of 90°, respectively, was accomplished between the layers.  ©2021 The Japan Institute of Metals and Materials.","Additive manufacturing; Crystallographic texture; Melt pool; Simulation","3D printers; Additives; Cellular automata; Cellular manufacturing; Crystal orientation; Heat transfer; Laser beams; Robots; Textures; Bi-directional scanning; Crystal orientation control; Crystallographic textures; Fabrication process; Microstructure controlling; Modified cellular automaton; Preferential orientation; Scanning strategies; Process control","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (JP18H05254)","This work was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [grant number JP18H05254].","Ishimoto T., Hagihara K., Hisamoto K., Sun S.-H., Nakano T., Scr.

Many researchers have studied the strengthening of FDM components by adding short carbon fibers (CF) or by reinforcing solid carbon fiber rods. In the current research, we sought to enhance the mechanical properties of FDM components by adding bioinspired solid CF rods during the fabrication process. An effective bonding interface of bioinspired CF rods and polylactic acid (PLA) was achieved by triangular interlocking sutures and by employing synthetic glue as the binding agent. In particular, the tensile strength of solid CF rod reinforced PLA samples was studied. Critical parameters such as layer thickness, ex-truder temperature, extruder speed, and shell thickness were considered for optimization. Significant process parameters were identified through leverage plots using the response surface methodology (RSM). The optimum parameters were found to be layer thickness of 0.04 mm, extruder temperature of 215◦ C, extruder speed of 60 mm/s, and shell thickness of 1.2 mm. The results revealed that the bioinspired solid CF rod reinforced PLA (CFRPLA) composite exhibited a tensile strength of 82.06 MPa, which was approximately three times higher than the pure PLA (28 MPa, 66% lower than CFRPLA), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) (28 MPa, 66% lower than CFRPLA), polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) (34 MPa, 60% lower than CFRPLA), and nylon (34 MPa, 60% lower than CFRPLA) samples. © 2020 by the authors.

LSP has recently been proposed to reduce tensile residual stresses during selective laser melting (SLM). The effects of LSP on part distortion, however, have not been rigorously examined. It is proposed here that SLM can be integrated with in situ LSP forming to reduce distortion of the upper surface of parts during or after printing. To study the distortion correction capability, a 2-stage computational framework is created, which includes physics-based models of the SLM process and LSP treatment. Stage 1 includes thermomechanical SLM simulation to predict surface geometry and is applied to model four 50-μm layers of a 316L part having a 4 mm × 4 mm footprint. Stage 2 of the framework includes an elastic-plastic thermomechanical shock-wave simulation to predict LSP surface treatment forming effects. Surface distortion is examined for varying laser spot size, overlap, and part temperatures from 300 to 500 K, using a nanosecond-pulsed infrared laser. For the 316L SLM sample, the upper surface is predicted to have ∼ 9-μm vertical distortion on the 200-μm 4-layer build. With a 2-μm allowable distortion, only 44.13% of the surface initially conforms. After one LSP forming treatment at 300 K, conformance improves to 84.75%. After a third LSP forming, with 50% laser power-density increase, surface conformance increases to 91%, demonstrating potential of the hybrid AM-LSP process in reducing finish-machining. © 2021, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Distortion correction; Hybrid additive manufacturing; Laser peen forming; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser shock peening; Numerical modeling","Elastoplasticity; Laser pulses; Powder metals; Predictive analytics; Selective laser melting; Shock waves; Surface treatment; Ultrafast lasers; Computational framework; Distortion correction; Laser power density; Physics-based models; Pulsed infrared lasers; Selective laser melting (SLM); Tensile residual stress; Thermomechanical shocks; Pulsed lasers","","","","","US National Science Foundation, (CMMI-1762722)","This work was supported in part by the US National Science Foundation CMMI-1762722.

This increases the demand for natural fibre based filaments in the field of AM. Hence, this research aims to develop filaments made of Polylactic acid (PLA) reinforced with Oil Palm Empty Fruit Bunch Fibre (OPEFBF) and to investigate its physical, thermal and mechanical properties. PLA with 10, 20, 30, and 40 wt.% of OPEFBF were melt blended, hot-pressed, and successfully extruded as filaments. Later, its physical, thermal, water absorption, biodegradation, and mechanical properties are investigated. OPEFBF reinforced filaments show lesser values of densities, increased Tensile Modulus (TM), better bio and thermal degradation compared to the pure PLA. However, its rate of water absorption is high with reduced Tensile Strength (TS) than the pure PLA. Later these filaments reinforced with different OPEFBF contents are 3D printed using Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technology. Filaments with lesser fibre content were easy to print. Filaments with 10 wt.% OPEFBF was continuously printed whereas, filaments with higher fibre content clogged in the nozzle. Overall, PLA reinforced with OPEFBF has been developed and successfully applied to the field of additive manufacturing by FDM. © 2021 Faculty of Mechanical Engineering.

The environmental impact of manufacturing the femoral component of a knee implant made from Ti-6Al-4V material was investigated. One AM method (electron beam melting (EBM)) and one CM method (milling) were analysed for the production of this part. A cradle to grave life cycle approach was utilised for each manufacturing method focusing on the primary energy consumption (PEC) and CO2 emissions. It was found that when the entire life cycle of the implant is considered, EBM is a more environmentally friendly method of producing the implant. This is mainly due to the complex geometry of the implant. For complex geometries, lots of waste material are generated using CM processes, whereas much less material is wasted using the AM process. The production of the raw material, Ti-6Al-4V, has a high PEC and associated CO2 emissions, so the amount of required raw material for either manufacturing method is the most important factor from an environmental perspective. Finally, the article presents the plans for future work and some remarks are concluded. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Additive manufacturing; Conventional manufacturing; Electron beam melting; LCA; Machining; Milling","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Artificial life; Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Geometry; Green manufacturing; Metal implants; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Complex geometries; Conventional manufacturing; Entire life cycles; Femoral component; Life cycle approach; Manufacturing methods; Medical implants; Primary energy consumption; Life cycle","","","","","Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, (16/RC/3872); European Regional Development Fund, FEDER","This publication has emanated from research supported in part by a research grant from Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) under Grant Number 16/RC/3872 and is co-funded under the European Regional Development Fund and I-Form industry partners.

FDM works by depositing layer by layer fabrication directly from CAD file. In the FDM process, the properties of parts depend on the proper selection of process parameters. Generally, the mechanical properties and surface quality of FDM parts are still relatively low compared to the typical manufacturing method. The study aims to fill the gap by modifying the current open-source 3D printer to improve the mechanical properties and surface quality by integrating the pressing mechanism. This study investigates the effect of three different types of pressing mechanism (roller, ball, and press) and compares with normal open source and commercial 3D printer. This research investigates the tensile strength and surface roughness when the 3D components are fabricated using these different mechanisms. Each pressing tool has a different shape, size, ability, and function, which affect the application of pressing mechanism during 3D printing. Based on the results, the roller pressing mechanism shows a better effect on the FDM components. It was found that, when the roller mechanism is integrated with the 3D printer, the tensile strength and the surface roughness can be improved. The findings indicate that the roller mechanism can potentially be used as integrated pressing tools to be attached to the 3D printer in improving its properties. © 2021 Zibeline International Publishing Sdn.

The purpose of the changes in the design, technology, and material tests was to make a steering gear housing using the SLM method. The steering gear housing was produced by the pressure casting method using an AlSi9Cu3(Fe) alloy. The construction of this housing is adapted to the specifics of left-hand traffic. The change in technology was related to the change of the position of the steering system from right-hand to left-hand and the demand for a limited number of gear housings. It was necessary to make a virtual model of the housing on the basis of the part that was removed from the vehicle. In SLM technology, the AlSi10Mg aluminum alloy was used as a raw material in the form of CL 32Al gas-atomized powder. After the SLM process was completed, the housings were subjected to heat treatment. The AlSi10Mg alloy fabricated by the SLM method after heat treatment is characterized by good plasticity and an average value of tensile strength. The last stage was to check the geometry of the SLM housing with a 3D scanner. As a result, a map of the dimensional deviations from the nominal values was obtained. This data was used to modify the CAD model before the next fabrication process. The use of 3D printing technology allowed for the quick production of elements. The time to develop the technology and the production of the first two gear housings based on a 3D model was seven days. © 2021 Polish Academy of Sciences.

In the conventional FDM process, the printing of curved objects causes the staircase effect and results in poor surface finish. In this work, the FDM process integrated with a 6-DOF Industrial robot is used to print the curved objects by generating non-linear tool paths to avoid the staircase effect. A standard NACA 0015 aircraft wing having curved surfaces is printed without staircase effect at a uniform deposition rate using an industrial robot. The wing is sliced into concentric curved layers either in the form of convex or a concave shape. A new methodology is developed by combining the non-linear toolpaths with the change in extruder orientation to print curved objects at a uniform deposition without any staircase effect. ABB Robotstudio simulation software is used for simulating the printing process and simulation results are validated by printing the portion of the wing using the Industrial robot with an FDM extruder as an end effector. The experimental results showed that the aircraft wing is printed successfully with uniform deposition at constant velocity without any staircase effect. © 2021 Materials and Energy Research Center.

Most of the time, only a small set of programming steps suffices for 3D design and manufacture. In particular, the proposed method requires no complex hardware or software, and it generates the geometric data on the fly. This is demonstrated using a simplified evaluation of general volumetric sweeps. The method side-steps many of the problems of the conventional Additive Manufacturing pipeline.

According to the results of these analyses, the best-lubricated surface geometry sample was identified, and a number of geometries were produced by SLM, which is one of the additive manufacturing methods. Tribological tests were performed using a pin-on-disk tribometer with a stainless steel ball as the contact surface. The structural and morphological features were investigated by a three-dimensional profilometer and scanning electron microscopy. Findings: The results obtained showed that the impregnated oil reached the surface of the sample compared to untreated samples, and it was seen that the wear rates were reduced, and that the impregnated oil samples exhibited the highest wear resistance. Originality/value: In this study, solid geometries that are difficult to be produced by other methods are produced with additive manufacturing method, and the surfaces have been given lubricating properties. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Friction; Lubrication; Selective laser melting method; Wear","Additives; Austenitic stainless steel; Geometry; Melting; Scanning electron microscopy; Tribology; Wear of materials; Wear resistance; 316 L stainless steel; Design/methodology/approach; Lubricating properties; Morphological features; Pin-on-disk tribometers; Selective laser melting (SLM); Stainless steel balls; Tribological behaviors; Selective laser melting","","","","","","","Berthier J., Gosselin D., Pham A., Boizot F., Delapierre G., Belgacem N., Chaussy D., Spontaneous capillary flows in piecewise varying cross section microchannels, Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical, 223, pp. 868-877, (2016); Dai Q., Huang W., Wang X., Khonsari M.M., Directional interfacial motion of liquids: fundamentals, evaluations, and manipulation strategies, Tribology International, 154, (2021); Dai Q., Khonsari M.M., Shen C., Huang W., Wang X., Thermocapillary migration of liquid droplets induced by a unidirectional thermal gradient, Langmuir, 32, 30, pp. 7485-7492, (2016); Donnet C., Erdemir A., Historical developments and new trends in tribological and solid lubricant coatings, Surface and Coatings Technology, 180-181, pp. 76-84, (2004); Grutzmacher P.G., Rosenkranz A., Rammacher S., Gachot C., Mucklich F., The influence of centrifugal forces on friction and wear in rotational sliding, Tribology International, 116, July, pp. 256-263, (2017); Grutzmacher P.G., Jalikop S.V., Gachot C., Rosenkranz A., Thermocapillary lubricant migration on textured surfaces – a review of theoretical and experimental insights, (2020); Hua X., Xie X., Yin B., Zhang P., Ji J., Wang H., Fu Y., Tribological performance and self-lubricating mechanism of the laser-textured surface filled with solid lubricant in rolling friction pair, Industrial Lubrication and Tribology, 70, 2, pp. 371-384, (2018); Kalentics N., de Seijas M.O.V., Griffiths S., Leinenbach C., Loge R.E., 3D laser shock peening – a new method for improving fatigue properties of selective laser melted parts, Additive Manufacturing, 33, January, (2020); Li C.X., Bell T., Sliding wear properties of active screen plasma nitrided 316 austenitic stainless steel, Wear, 256, 11-12, pp. 1144-1152, (2004); Liang H., Guo D., Ma L., Luo J., Experimental investigation of centrifugal effects on lubricant replenishment in the starved regime at high speeds, Tribology Letters, 59, 1, pp. 1-9, (2015); Lu L., Zhang Z., Guan Y., Zheng H., Comparison of the effect of typical patterns on friction and wear properties of chromium alloy prepared by laser surface texturing, Optics & Laser Technology, 106, pp. 272-279, (2018); Mostafaei A., Rodriguez De Vecchis P., Nettleship I., Chmielus M., Effect of powder size distribution on densification and microstructural evolution of binder-jet 3D-printed alloy 625, Materials & Design, 162, pp. 375-383, (2019); Ran S., Winnubst L., Blank D.H.A., Pasaribu H.R., Sloetjes J.W., Schipper D.J., Dry-sliding self-lubricating ceramics: CuO doped 3Y-TZP, Wear, 267, 9-10, (2009); Reinert L., Varenberg M., Mucklich F., Suarez S., Dry friction and wear of self-lubricating carbon-nanotube-containing surfaces, Wear, 406-407, pp. 33-42, (2018); Uzun Y., Kovaci H., Yetim A.F., Celik A., Effect of boronizing on the structural, mechanical and tribological properties of CoCrW dental alloy produced by selective laser melting, Industrial Lubrication and Tribology, 71, 3, pp. 348-356, (2019); Yazici M., Kovaci H., Yetim A.F., Celik A., Structural, mechanical and tribological properties of Ti and TiN coatings on 316L stainless steel, Ceramics International, 44, 12, pp. 14195-14201, (2018); Yildiz F., Yetim A.F., Alsaran A., Efeoglu I., Wear and corrosion behaviour of various surface treated medical grade titanium alloy in bio-simulated environment, Wear, 267, 5-8, pp. 695-701, (2009); Zeng Z., Cong B.Q., Oliveira J.P., Ke W.C., Schell N., Peng B., Qi Z.W., Ge F.G., Zhang W., Ao S.S., Wire and arc additive manufacturing of a Ni-rich NiTi shape memory alloy: microstructure and mechanical properties, Additive Manufacturing, 32, January, (2020); Zhang H., Zhu H., Qi T., Hu Z., Zeng X., Selective laser melting of high strength Al-Cu-Mg alloys: processing, microstructure and mechanical properties, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 656, pp. 47-54, (2016)","K.

However, the quality and reproducibility of parts manufactured by this technique is still a problem. Overcoming this issue requires an understanding of multiple complex physical phenomena which occur simultaneously during the process. This work illustrates a powerful new technique which synchronizes high-speed x-ray imaging with high-speed infrared imaging to study laser powder bed fusion processes in real time. Using this technique, we demonstrate the simultaneous observation of multiple phenomena including three-dimensional melt pool visualization, vapor plume dynamics, spatter formation, thermal history, and point cooling rates. The paired observation of these dynamic phenomena is critical to understanding the fundamentals of laser powder bed fusion, and the overall impact of process parameters on print quality. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","","Thermography (imaging); Three dimensional computer graphics; Dynamic phenomena; High-speed infrared imaging; In-situ analysis; Manufacturing techniques; Physical phenomena; Process parameters; Reproducibilities; Simultaneous observation; Powder metals","","","","","Alex Deriy; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-AC02-06CH11357); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; Argonne National Laboratory, ANL; Laboratory Directed Research and Development, LDRD; American Pain Society, APS","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank Alex Deriy at the APS for their assistance in the beamline experiments.

Design/methodology/approach: Unlike the deposition-on-demand printing method, the proposed curing-on-demand printheads use a digital light processing (DLP) projector to selectively cure a thin layer of liquid photocurable resin and then clean the residual uncured material effectively using a vacuuming and post-curing device. Each printhead can individually fabricate one type of material using digitally controlled mask image patterns. The proposed AM process can accurately deposit multiple materials in each layer by combining multiple curing-on-demand printheads together. Consequently, a three-dimensional object can be fabricated layer-by-layer using the developed curing-on-demand printing method. Findings: Effective cleaning of uncured resin is realized with reduced coated resin whose height is in the sub-millimeter level and improved vacuum cleaning performance with the uncleaned resin less than 10 µm thick. Also, fast material swapping is achieved using the compact design of multiple printheads. Originality/value: The proposed multi-material stereolithography (SL) process enables 3D printing components using more viscous materials and can achieve desired manufacturing characteristics, including high feature resolution, fast fabrication speed and low machine cost. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing;

One limitation of additive manufacturing technologies hindering their adoption in high-performance structural composites is the lack of compatible high operating temperature thermosetting resins with robust thermo-oxidative stability. To address this limitation, a reactive melt extruded thermosetting polyimide filament was printed via fused filament fabrication (FFF). A crosslink chemistry has been designed with slow reaction kinetics at the printing temperature which allows printing in a similar manner to engineering thermoplastic filaments. A cure cycle for the as-printed uncrosslinked articles was developed to achieve full cure without loss of shape. The glass transition temperature of the fully cured resin is 250 °C. Comparing longitudinal and transverse tensile strengths of printed and cured coupons showed highly anisotropic behavior. Transverse and through-thickness properties for both uncured and cured printed coupons were nearly identical. The average measured tensile strength of printed and fully cured material was 86 MPa; 73% of fully cured compression molded strength. These results demonstrate the ability to 3D print high performance thermosets without changing commercially available FFF machines. © 2020","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Fused filament fabrication; Thermosetting Polyimide","Additives; Crosslinking; Curing; Glass transition; Melt spinning; Polyimides; Reaction kinetics; Resins; Temperature; Tensile strength; Thermosets; Additive manufacturing technology; Anisotropic behaviors; Engineering thermoplastics; High operating temperature; High-performance thermosets; Structural composites; Thermo-oxidative stability; Thermosetting polyimides; 3D printers","","","","","Materials and Manufacturing Directorate; PolyOne, Inc.; Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (17RXCOR436); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR; University of Dayton Research Institute, UDRI","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank Ron Trejo, Dayle Pearson, Marlene Houtz, Daniel Rapking, and Robyn Bradford from UDRI and Patricia Hubbard, Tom Hughes, and Chris Murphy from PolyOne, Inc.

Special attention is paid to the description of non-equilibrium structures and compositional fields resulting from the ultrafast cooling of the LPBF process. Observations reveal the existence of a glass state in eutectic areas, wherein short-range ordering of the diamond-Si structure is observed. The apparent very fast solidification of eutectic regions is found to involve a local strain in adjacent Al cells, which extends up to 100 nm on average. In the supersaturated aluminium solid solution retained by the LPBF process, two populations of clusters are identified, for which the potential role of the selection of hardening phases is discussed. It is proposed that the microstructure of former melt pools outside heat-affected areas is described by the repetition of a periodic microstructural pattern consisting of eutectic regions /strain-hardened Al-crystals /strain-free Al-crystals with a high density of solute-rich clusters. © 2020 The Authors","Additive manufacturing powder bed fusion; Al-mg-Si; Aluminium; Amorphous; Atom probe tomography; Clustering; Design; Gradient; Laser powder bed fusion; LPBF; Microstructure; Selective laser melting; SLM","Atom lasers; Crystals; Eutectics; Scanning electron microscopy; Selective laser melting; Silicon; Solidification; Atom probe tomography; Heat-affected areas; Microstructural patterns; Nonequilibrium structures; Scanning transmission electron microscopy; Selective laser melting (SLM); Short range ordering; Ultra-fast cooling; High resolution transmission electron microscopy","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; European Research Council, ERC; Fonds pour la Formation à la Recherche dans l’Industrie et dans l’Agriculture, FRIA; Horizon 2020, (716678)","P.

Results visualization and evaluation methods are conducted to demonstrate the high performance of the models. Our results show that detection latency is also improved by successfully recognizing the transitions between print quality conditions within a single raster.

Due to differences in the technical specifications of AM technologies, the final fabricated parts can vary sig-nificantly from the original CAD models, therefore raising issues regarding accuracy, surface finish, robustness, mechanical properties, functional and geometrical constraints. Various researchers have studied the correlation between AM technologies and design rules. In this work we propose a novel approach to assessing the capability of a 3D model to be printed successfully (a.k.a printability ) on a specific AM machine. This is utilized by taking into consideration the model mesh complexity and certain part characteristics. A printability score is derived for a model in reference to a specific 3D printing technology, expressing the probability of obtaining a robust and accurate end result for 3D printing on a specific AM machine. The printability score can be used either to determine which 3D technology is more suitable for manufacturing a specific model or as a guide to redesign the model to ensure printability. We verify this framework by conducting 3D printing experiments for benchmark models which are printed on three AM machines employing different technologies: Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Binder Jetting (3DP), and Material Jetting (Polyjet). © 2021 CAD Solutions, LLC.","3D printing technologies; Additive manufacturing; Printability scor","Computer aided design; Fused Deposition Modeling; 3D technology; Additive manufacturing technology; Benchmark models; Fabricated parts; Fused deposition modeling (FDM); Geometrical constraints; Surface finishes; Technical specifications; 3D modeling","","","","","European Union and Greek national funds; Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, (T1EDK-04928)","This research has been co-financed by the European Union and Greek national funds through the Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, under the call RESEARCH-CREATE-INNOVATE (project code:T1EDK-04928).","3D Life: 3D Life: Crafting Perfection; Abshire M., 3d cad design for 3d printing-tips, tricks, techniques: Part 1 of 3; Adam G., Zimmer D., On design for additive manufacturing: evaluating geometrical limitations, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 21, 6, pp. 662-670, (2015); Booth J., Alperovich J., Chawla P., Ma J., Reid T., Ramani K., The design for additive manufacturing worksheet, Journal of Mechanical Design, 139, (2017); Brockotter R., Key design considerations for 3d printing; Decker N., Yee A., A simplified benchmarking model for the assessment of dimensional accuracy in fdm processes, International Journal of Rapid Manufacturing, 5, 2, pp. 145-154, (2015); Gibson I., Rosen D., Stucker B., Additive Manufacturing Technologies, (2015); Globa A., Donn M., Ulchitskiy O., Metrics for measuring complexity of geometric models, Scientific visualization, 8, 5, pp. 74-82, (2016); Jee H., Lu Y., Witherell P., Design rules with modularity for additive manufacturing, Proceedings of the Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium, (2015); Kim H., Lin Y., Tseng B., A review on quality control in additive manufacturing, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 24, pp. 645-669, (2018); Mani M., Witherell P., Jee H., Design rules for additive manufacturing: A categorization, ASME 2017 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference, pp. 1-10, (2017); Michael D., Johnson L.M.V., Thomison W.D., An investigation and evaluation of computer-aided design model complexity metrics, Computer-Aided Design and Applications, 15, 1, pp. 61-75, (2018); Minetola I.L., Benchmarking of fdm machines through part quality using it grades, Procedia CIRP, 41, pp. 1027-1032, (2016); Ntousia M., Fudos I., 3D printing technologies and applications: An overview, Proceedings of the CAD 2020 Conference, pp. 243-248, (2019); Oropallo W., Piegl L.A., Ten challenges in 3d printing, Engineering with Computers, 32, 1, pp. 135-148, (2016); Ramya A., Vanapalli S., 3d printing technologies in various applications, International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Technology, 7, 3, pp. 396-409, (2016); Rebaioli L., Fassi I., A review on benchmark artifacts for evaluating the geometrical performance of additive manufacturing processes, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 93, pp. 2571-2598, (2017); Rossignac J., Shape complexity, Visual Computer, 21, pp. 985-996, (2005); Stamati V., Antonopoulos G., Azariadis P., Fudos I., A parametric feature-based approach to recon-structing traditional filigree jewelry, Computer Aided Design, 43, 12, pp. 1814-1828, (2011); Stavropoulos G., Moschonas P., Moustakas K., Tzovaras D., Strintzis M.G., 3-d model search and retrieval from range images using salient features, IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 12, 7, pp. 692-704, (2010); Tofail S.A., Koumoulos E.P., Bandyopadhyay A., Bose S., O'Donoghue L., Charitidis C., Additive manufacturing: scientific and technological challenges, market uptake and opportunities, Materials Today, 21, 1, pp. 22-37, (2018); Tompson M., Moroni G., Vaneker T., Fadel G., Campbell I., Gibson I., Bernard A., Schulz J., Graf P., Ahuja B., Martina F., Design for additive manufacturing: Trends, opportunities, considerations, and constraints, CIRP annals: manufacturing technology, 65, 2, pp. 737-760, (2016); Yang S., Zhao Y.F., Additive manufacturing-enabled design theory and methodology: a critical review, The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 80, 1, pp. 327-342, (2015); Zhang Y., Bernard A., Gupta R., Harik R., Feature based building orientation optimization for additive manufacturing, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 22, 2, pp. 358-376, (2016)","I.

Yet, due to the complex structure of SLM machines and low processing rates, the SLM process is highly energy-intensive. Energy forecasting is crucial for accurate evaluation and reduction of SLM energy consumption. However, due to the diversity of SLM machines and their various operating states, the energy consumption of SLM processes is difficult to predict. This article presents a novel method to forecast the energy consumption of SLM processes. The proposed approach is based on the power modelling of machine subsystems and the temporal modelling of sub-processes. Through identifying the working statuses of subsystems of SLM machines in each sub-process, forecast accuracy can be greatly improved. Two cases of aluminium components fabricated by an SLM process using an SLM 280HL facility are selected to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method outperforms specific, stage-based and subsystem-based energy benchmark models in energy consumption forecasting. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","3D printing;

However, the high porosity may theoretically compromise mechanical resistance. Literature is deficient about the use and safety profile of cementless femoral implants built using additive manufacturing (in particular electron beam melting technology, EBM). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the survival rates and the reason for revisions (especially implant breakage) of the first two EBM-built stems at a mid-term follow-up, using a joint arthroplasty registry. Methods: The registry of Prosthetic Orthopedic Implant (RIPO) was investigated about cementless stems implanted from 2010 to 2017. Stems built with EBM technology (Parva and Pulchra stems; Adler Ortho, Milan, Italy) were compared to all the other cementless stems implanted during the same period, acting as control group. The survival rates and reasons for revision were assessed. Results: No stem breakage occurred. At 5-year follow-up, the survival rates of the two cohorts were not statistically different (96.8% EBM stems, 98.0% standard cementless stems; p > 0.05). In the EBM stems, aseptic loosening occurred in 1.7% of the cases at the latest follow-up. Conclusions: This large cohort showed that mechanical resistance is not a concern in EBM stems at mid-term follow-up. However, larger populations and longer follow-ups are needed to further validate these results.

In this study, highly flowable coarse AlSi10Mg powders with average diameter of 65 µm were prepared and then they were additively manufactured by using the selective laser melting (SLM) process. The relative densities exceeding 99% were consistently obtained from the samples fabricated at the scan speed of 1000–2000 mm·s−1 in the range of laser power from 350 to 390 W. The tensile strengths and elongation of all the samples were characterised. Furthermore, Al alloy processed by coarse AlSi10Mg powders does not show a big change in strength values compared to those fabricated by fine AlSi10Mg powders with 45 µm in diameter. Thus, these results clearly show that the developed coarse AlSi10Mg powders can be effectively utilised for the SLM process. © 2021 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining Published by Taylor & Francis on behalf of the Institute.","additive manufacturing; AlSi10Mg; powder size; SLM","Aluminum alloys; Fabrication; Melting; Powder metals; Silicon alloys; Tensile strength; 3-D printing; Average diameter; Big changes; Laser power; Relative density; Selective laser melting (SLM); Strength values; Structural applications; Selective laser melting","","","","","Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE, (20004486); Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE","This study was supported by the R&D project entitled ‘Development for car body lightweighting and material localisation using 3D Printing technology (Project No: 20004486)’ by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy of the Republic of Korea.

Powder granules with different strengths were achieved by changing the printing parameters, including the layer thickness and saturation level. The printed powder granules were then characterised for their structural properties such as their porosity and printing accuracy. Different parameter settings were found to have a significant influence on surface roughness. The strength of powder granules was improved by increasing the print saturation level, without compromising the printed geometry. A breakage study was carried out by compression tests of granules printed with different shapes and strengths. The relationship between print setting, structure and strength was established and discussed. This study demonstrates that AM powder granules with designed shapes and well-controlled strengths may act as ideal calibration particles for a range of industrial applications. © 2021 The Society of Powder Technology Japan","Agglomerate breakage; Binder jetting; Powder granule","3D printers; Compression testing; Setting; Surface roughness; Different shapes; Layer thickness; Parameter setting; Saturation levels; Solidification process; Wet granulation; Granulation","","","","","International Fine Particle Research Institute; Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP150100119); Deakin University","This research project was supported by the International Fine Particle Research Institute (IFPRI) and an ARC Discovery grant (DP150100119).

However, current post-processing solutions are unable to cope with the varieties of printed parts, where post-production tasks differs for each part based on the desired outcome. Therefore, current post-processing treatments rely heavily on manual labor. Thus, to move towards end-to-end automated post-processing that can cater to individual processes for different parts, a fully automated vision pipeline for classifying and locating parts printed by polymer or metal powder-based processes, such as Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), binder jetting and HP Multi Jet Fusion (MJF) is proposed. The main contributions of this paper are the simulation of powder distribution on the surface of the 3D-printed parts after powder-based printing, and the incorporation of these powdered models in a sim-to-real deep learning pipeline. Our network that was trained on powdered models obtained classification and localisation results comparable to a network trained on real images. Also, the superiority of artificial powder models was shown when compared with using the original, unpowdered CAD models, especially for parts that are significantly different from their CAD models due to powder accumulation. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","artificial powder generation;

Fused filament fabrication (FFF), as a material extrusion additive manufacturing (AM) technology, can be applied to fabricate C-CFRTP parts with complex structures. However, the underlying fiber–matrix impregnation behavior during FFF of C-CFRTP composites, which is a key factor to bridge process parameters and mechanical properties, is still unknown. In this paper, we developed a theoretical model to discern the impregnation process at different parametric conditions. The microscopic measurement of continuous carbon fiber reinforced polylactic acid (PLA) specimens was conducted to characterize the impregnation percentage for the model verification. The results indicated that almost all predicted values agreed well with the experimental results. Additionally, the increase in impregnation percentage was found to improve the tensile strength. The findings in this work provide insights into the process-impregnation-property relationship and promote the effective FFF fabrication of C-CFRTP components. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Continuous carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic composites; Impregnation model; Material extrusion; Tensile property","3D printers; Additives; Fibers; Graphite fibers; Impregnation; Polyesters; Tensile strength; Carbon fiber reinforced; Complex structure; Impregnation process; Microscopic measurement; Model verification; Parametric conditions; Process parameters; Theoretical modeling; Reinforced plastics","","","","","National Innovative Research Group, (51621064); Dalian Science and Technology Innovation Fund, (2018J11CY001); Dalian Science and Technology Innovation Fund","Fuji Wang acknowledges the supports by the Science and Technology Innovation Foundation of Dalian (Grant#: 2018J11CY001 ) and National Innovative Research Group (Grant#: 51621064 ) in China.","Domm M., Schlimbach J., Mitschang P., Characterization method for continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic strands, J.

Although the conventional Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method is well-established, it does not accommodate variation in the spatial domains of the melt pool (MP) and heat affected zone (HAZ) with time. Thus, the predicted microstructure remains relatively similar even over large AM build domains. While the existing KMC approach may suffice over spatial regions in which the MP and HAZ remain relatively unchanged, this circumstance is largely contrary to what experimentalists have recently found when imaging different regions in PBF and DED AM builds, thus raising issues with scalability and versatility of the method. The Dynamic KMC framework proposed in this work addresses these concerns by implementing discretized, spatially-varying MP and HAZ at every time increment during the grain structure prediction. The new framework operates in two stages; stage one establishes the 3D spatial MP and HAZ dimensions using either thermal finite element (FE) simulation or through experimental 3D thermal imaging; stage two subsequently integrates these time-varying MP and HAZ dimensions into the KMC algorithm at every time increment during the build. Thus, the Dynamic KMC framework captures the effects that rapid thermal cycles and heat accumulation have on grain nucleation and growth. The method is demonstrated through a case study involving a thin-walled Inconel 625 structure made by the selective laser melting (SLM) type of laser-based powder bed fusion (PBF-LB). The numerically predicted microstructures at various regions and scan layers within the build show strong agreement with experimentally observed trends reported in literature. Significant variations in grain morphology predicted by the Dynamic KMC framework can, according to specific thermal histories, provide investigators with new capabilities in assessing mechanical property variations across different regions of AM parts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Dynamic Kinetic Monte Carlo; Electron backscatter diffraction; Grain structure prediction; Numerical modeling; Powder bed fusion; Selective laser melting","Additives; Forecasting; Grain size and shape; Heat affected zone; Infrared imaging; Kinetics; Light modulators; Microstructure; Morphology; Powder metals; Selective laser melting; Thin walled structures; Finite element simulations; Grain morphologies; Heat accumulation; Kinetic Monte Carlo; Kinetic Monte Carlo methods; Microstructure of metals; Selective laser melting (SLM); Structure prediction; Monte Carlo methods","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CMMI-1762722)","The authors acknowledge the support of U.S. National Science Foundation , grant no.

The Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is chosen as the reference technology because of its great diffusion in the industrial manufacturing chain, although the proposed methodology can be applied to the numerical simulation of all types of AM. An octree-based mesh adaptivity approach is adopted allowing for the use of much finer meshes within the processing zone, the so called Thermo-Mechanically Affected Zone (TMAZ), if compared to the rest of the computational domain. Although the adaptive meshing is vital to keep controlled the computational resources through the entire simulation of the fabrication process, the accuracy of the results can be compromised by the coarsening strategy, and particularly when simulating the SLM process, where the mesh size can vary from microns (TMAZ) to centimetres (close to the build-plate). This loss of accuracy can spoil the original efforts in refining the mesh in the process zone. Therefore a strategy to compensate for information loss in the adaptive refinement simulation of additive manufacturing processes is developed. The main idea is to add two correction terms which compensate for the loss of accuracy in the coarsening process of the mesh in the already manufactured regions. The proposed correction terms can be interpreted as a Variational Multiscale enhancement on the adaptive mesh. This allows one to successfully simulate the additive manufacturing process by using an adaptively coarsened mesh, with results which have an accuracy very similar to the one of a uniformly refined mesh simulation, at a fraction of the computational cost. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of the proposed strategy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","adaptive refinement; additive manufacturing; Finite Element; numerical simulation","Additives; Coarsening; Finite element method; Numerical models; Ostwald ripening; Selective laser melting; Adaptive finite element; Additive manufacturing process; Computational domains; Computational resources; Industrial manufacturing; Selective laser melting (SLM); Thermomechanically affected zones; Variational multiscale; Mesh generation","","","","","Catalan Government; Spanish Ministry of Economy; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; Generalitat de Catalunya; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO, (CEX2018-000797-S); Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats, ICREA; Ministerio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España, MINECO, (DPI2017-85998-P)","Funding text 1: J.

High fracture stresses of around 1700 MPa and a reproducible plastic strain of about 0.5% were obtained for cylindrical SLM samples. The analysis of the observed serrations during compressive loading implies that the shear-band dynamics in the additively manufactured samples distinctly differ from those of the as-cast glass. This phenomenon appears to originate from the presence of uniformly dispersed spherical pores as well as from the more pronounced heterogeneity of the glass itself as revealed by instrumented indentation. Despite these heterogeneities, the shear bands are straight and form in the plane of maximum shear stress. Additive manufacturing, hence, might not only allow for producing large BMG samples with complex geometries but also for manipulating their deformation behaviour through tailoring porosity and structural heterogeneity. © 2020","Bulk metallic glass; Heterogeneity; Powder bed fusion; Selective laser melting; Serrated flow","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Copper alloys; Fabrication; Glass; Melting; Metallic glass; Plastic deformation; Shear bands; Titanium alloys; Zircaloy; Bulk metallic glass; Compressive loading; Deformation behaviour; Instrumented indentation; Maximum shear stress; Selective laser melting (SLM); Structural heterogeneity; Zr based bulk metallic glass; Selective laser melting","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (KO 5571/1-1, KU 1974/11-1, PA 2275/4-1, PA 2275/6-1); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; China Scholarship Council, CSC","The authors thank Y.H.

These wire and arc systems can work cooperatively in a concurrent manner in the process of manufacturing the components. In this paper, the residual stress of multi arc-based cooperative metal additive manufacturing is investigated with finite element (FE) simulations. Firstly, on the basis of considering the temperature-dependent thermal-physical properties, the double ellipsoid heat source model is used to establish the calculation model of the molten pool heat transfer in the multi arc-based cooperative metal additive manufacturing. Temperature field distribution of this process is firstly calculated and analyzed. These results are fed into the thermal elastic-plastic FE models and then the stress can be calculated. The analysis of stress evolution in different positions of the deposition layer indicate that the residual stress in the inter-bead is higher than that inside the welding bead. © 2020 Japan Welding Society.

Various theoretical models have been proposed to explain the melting behavior of the polymer filament in the FFF process. The most prevalent model involves the formation of a pool of polymer melt at the nozzle that is pushed out of the orifice by the solid filament acting as a piston (Bellini et al., 2004) [1]. An alternative model that suggests the formation of a melt film, with thickness varying as a function of the force exerted by the solid filament, is used as basis for this work. This model, known as the ""Fused Filament Fabrication melting model"", was proposed by Osswald et al. (2018) [2] and assumes a Newtonian fluid, which is a simplification of the real rheological behavior of polymeric melts. This work aims to improve this model by implementing the shear thinning behavior of the material into the equations. The analytical solution of the shear thinning model is compared to models found in literature using experimental data at different printing conditions. By comparing these models, it was shown that the implementation of shear thinning effects enhances the prediction of the melting behavior of the filament material at both low and high printing temperatures using the corresponding assumptions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","","3D printers; Fabrication; Metal melting; Newtonian liquids; Non Newtonian flow; Polymer melts; Shear flow; Shear thinning; Complex geometries; Experimental validations; Filament materials; Polymer filaments; Printing conditions; Rheological behaviors; Shear thinning effect; Shear-thinning behavior; Analytical models","","","","","FusedForm; Flora Family Foundation, FFF; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (377472739/GRK 2423/1-2019); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG","Funding text 1: This research was funded in part by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) - 377472739/GRK 2423/1-2019 .

However, a higher research cost makes it hardly carry out by a traditional methodology, the best way to solve the problem is using simulation software. This paper aims to find an optimal processing parameters combination for a specimen with the smallest distortion and lowest residual stress through Simufact Additive (SA) software. Simulation results under an optimal processing parameters, which led to a smallest value of distortion and residual stress, was the combination of scan power with 300W, scan speed with 1.3m/s, scan interval with one spot diameter (0.12mm) and heat treatment holding time with 4h.

The scattering of spatter particle as liquid metal during SLM process affects the layer consolidation of powder bed in addition to the surface quality of built part. The present study is focused on the spatter particle behavior of maraging steel during SLM to achieve a thorough understanding of the phenomena that occur during the melting and fusing of the metal powder. The spatter particles are tracked using high speed imaging, and the effects of the process parameters on the spatter particle behavior are investigated. The spatter particles ejected from the melt pool are also physically and chemically evaluated. The results showed that the spatter particles were classified as being spherical or satellite types, according to their scattered volumes; some spatter particles were larger than the particles in the initial metal powder. Most spatter particles were ejected from the droplet formed around the melt pool and from the melted powder in front of the melt pool; the number of spatter particles ejected from the melt pool was relatively low. The surface roughness affected the generation locations and tracks of the spatter particles, and the substrate surface wettability was the principal factor affecting the spatter particle behavior. © 2021 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers","Additive manufacturing; High speed imaging; Selective laser melting; Spatter particle; Surface roughness; Wettability","High speed cameras; Lakes; Melting; Metals; Powder metals; Selective laser melting; Wetting; Experimental investigations; High speed imaging; Laser melting process; Melt pool; Melting and solidification; Particle behavior; Powder bed; Process parameters; Selective laser melting; Spatter particle; Surface roughness","","","","",", (20K14623); ","","Alkahari M.

Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) technique was utilized in order to fabricate lattice structures with different relative densities, at 10%, 20% and 30%, using Polylactic acid (PLA). The test specimens were formed by structural TPMS unit cells and they were tested under quasi-static compression. A finite element analysis (FEA) was performed in order to predict their stress-strain behavior and compare with the experimental results. The results revealed that each architecture influences the mechanical properties of the structure differently depending on the impact of size effect. The structures were designed as sandwich structures (with a top and bottom plate) to avoid significant deterioration of the mechanical behavior, due to the size effect and this was achieved at high relative densities. The Schwarz Diamond structure demonstrated the highest mechanical strength compared with the other architectures, while the Gyroid structure also revealed a similar mechanical performance. In addition, Schwarz Primitive structure showed increased energy absorption especially during plastic deformation. The overall results revealed that the integrity of the mechanical properties of the studied TPMS FFF printed structures deteriorates, as the relative density of the structures decreases. © 2021 by the authors.

Sintering in conventional (CT) furnaces has been extensively performed as the post-printing process to densify 3D printed parts, and exploring alternative sintering approaches is considerably lacking. The current study aimed to present a detailed comparative analysis of the consolidation of as-printed parts in CT and microwave (MW) furnaces. Accordingly, binderless 3D printed parts made of Mg-5.06Zn-0.15Zr powder were subjected to CT and MW sintering for various isothermal holding times and their physical, mechanical, and chemical properties, as well as sintering kinetics models, were thoroughly evaluated and compared. It was revealed that MW results in a three-fold reduction in sintering time compared to CT sintering counterparts. Supported by the analysis of sintering mechanisms, the MW sintering process is not merely governed by the thermal effect in a similar way to CT sintering, but the non-thermal phenomenon originating from the conversion of electromagnetic energy contributes substantially to the densification of 3D printed Mg parts by triggering the viscous flow mechanism. Furthermore, results indicated that the Mg sample sintered in MW for 15 h has an interconnected porous structure with comparable density, pores features, elastic modulus, and compressive strength to those found in human cortical bone types. Overall, this work enlightens the great potential of MW sintering as an attractive alternative to reduce the energy consumption and shorten the lead time of the binder jetting technology. © 2020","Additive manufacturing; Binder jetting; Binderless 3D printing; Kinetic analysis; Magnesium alloys; Microwave heating","Additives; Bone; Compressive strength; Electromagnetic waves; Energy utilization; Magnesium alloys; Sintering; Ternary alloys; Zinc alloys; Zircaloy; Comparative analysis; Human cortical bone; Interconnected porous structure; Isothermal holding; Jetting technology; Microwave sintering; Rapid densification; Sintering mechanism; 3D printers","","","","","","","Gupta M., Sharon N.M.L., Magnesium, Magnesium Alloys, and Magnesium Composites, (2011); Joost W.J., Krajewski P.E., Towards magnesium alloys for high-volume automotive applications, Scr.

The research objective is to find out the process limitation and key processing parameters for printing fine porous structures so as to give reference for design and manufacturing planning. Design/methodology/approach: In metallic AM processes, the difficulty of geometric modeling and manufacturing of structures with pore sizes less than 350 μm exists. The manufacturability of porous structures in selective laser melting (SLM) has rarely been investigated, leading to unpredicted manufacturing results and preventing steady medical or industrial application. To solve this problem, a comprehensive experimental study was conducted to benchmark the manufacturability of the SLM process for extremely fine porous structures (less than 350 um and near a limitation of 100 um) and propose a manufacturing result evaluation method. Numerous porous structure samples were printed to help collect critical datasets for manufacturability analysis. Findings: The results show that the SLM process can achieve an extreme fine feature with a diameter of 90 μm in stable process control, and the process parameters with their control strategies as well as the printing process planning have an important impact on the printing results. A statistical analysis reveals the implicit complex relations between the porous structure geometries and the SLM process parameter settings. Originality/value: It is the first time to investigate the manufacturability of extremely fine porous structures of SLM. The method for manufacturability analysis and printing parameter control of fine porous structure are discussed. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive Manufacturing; Manufacturability Analysis; Porous Structure; Selective Laser Melting (SLM)","Aluminum alloys; Industrial research; Melting; Pore size; Selective laser melting; Stability criteria; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Design/methodology/approach; Geometric modeling; Manufacturability analysis; Manufacturing planning; Process parameters; Processing parameters; Research objectives; Selective laser melting (SLM); Process control","","","","","State Key Laboratory of Additive Manufacturing, China academy of engineering physics, (ZM17002)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support from the State Key Laboratory of Additive Manufacturing, China academy of engineering physics (ZM17002).","Bandyopadhyay A., Mitra I., Shivaram A., Et al., Direct comparison of additively manufactured porous titanium and tantalum implants towards in vivo osseointegration, Additive Manufacturing, 28, pp. 259-266, (2019); Bernardin J.D., Ferguson K., Satter D., Et al., The design, analysis, and fabrication of an additively manufactured twisted tube heat exchanger, Proceedings of the ASME 2017 Heat Transfer Summer Conference, (2021); Calignano F., Cattano G., Iuliano L., Et al., Controlled porosity structures in aluminum and titanium alloys by selective laser melting, Industrializing Additive Manufacturing – Proceedings of Additive Manufacturing in Products and Applications – AMPA2017.

Agglomeration and coarsening of precipitates in gas atomized GRCop-84 powder occurred above a threshold of 17 μm in diameter. Area of precipitates within cross sections is consistent among powder particles of different diameters indicating a consistent atomization process. Precipitates within gas atomized powder were shown to either melt and subsequently re-precipitate as the melt pool rapidly cools or break apart during LPBF resulting in precipitates smaller than in the initial powder. Precipitate size in powder therefore does not affect precipitate size, and thus tensile strength, in LPBF GRCop-84. © 2021 American Nuclear Society.","Additive manufacturing; GRCop-84; laser powder bed fusion; powder precipitates","Atom lasers; Binary alloys; Chromium alloys; Coarsening; Copper alloys; Niobium alloys; Precipitation (chemical); Selective laser melting; Atomization process; Gas-atomized powders; Hardened alloy; High conductivity; Laser powders; Powder particles; Precipitate size; Ultimate tensile strength; Tensile strength","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (DMR-14-19807); National Science Foundation, NSF; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; Fusion Energy Sciences, FES, (DE-FC02-04ER54698); Fusion Energy Sciences, FES","This work is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Fusion Energy Sciences, using User Facility DIII-D, under award number DE-FC02-04ER54698.

Modified outer surface of components in the GT (gas turbine) improves the performance by the increase of inlet temperature, enhancing longer life and providing many interrelated surfaces to withstand severe working conditions. This work is based on characteristic (mechanical, thermal, and tribology) evaluation of TBC-coated GT components made of Inconel 718 manufactured from traditional and 3-D printing-based selective laser melting (SLM) process and compared. TBCs comprising bond coat and top ceramic oxide coat were deposited by High-Velocity Oxy-Fuel and Atmospheric Plasma Spraying techniques, respectively. Characteristics evaluated by varying coating thickness, standoff distance, substrate preheating, Input torch power, etc., revealed that characteristics of substrates manufactured from SLM methods improved significantly except porosity and average surface roughness. These improvements are essential for embedding sensors, thin films, etc., in TBCs for continuous monitoring of outputs.  © 2021 Mohammed Yunus and Mohammad S.

The optimization of the process was performed to identify the relationship between the chosen factors and the tensile strength of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and carbon fiber polylactic acid (PLA) thermoplastic material, FDM printed specimens. The relationship was demonstrated by using the linear experimental model analysis, and a prediction expression was established. The developed prediction expression can be used for the prediction of tensile strength of selected thermoplastic materials at a 95% confidence level. Design/methodology/approach: The Taguchi L9 experimental methodology was used to plan the total number of experiments to be performed. The process parameters were chosen as three at three working levels. The working range of chosen factors was the printing speed (60, 80 and 100mm/min), 40%, 60% and 80% as the infill density and 0.1mm, 0.2mm and 0.3mm as the layer thickness. The fused deposition modeling process parameters were optimized to get the maximum tensile strength in FDM printed ABS and carbon fiber PLA thermoplastic material specimens. Findings: The optimum condition was achieved by the process optimization, and the desired results were obtained. The maximum desirability was achieved as 0.98 (98%) for the factors, printing speed 100mm/min, infill density 60mm and layer thickness 0.3mm. The strength of the ABS specimen was predicted to be 23.83MPa. The observed strength value was 23.66MPa. The maximum desirability was obtained as 1 (100%) for the factors, printing speed 100mm/min, infill density 60mm and layer thickness 0.2mm. The strength of the carbon fiber PLA specimen was predicted to be 26.23MPa, and the obtained value was 26.49MPa. Research limitations/implications: The research shows the useful process parameters and their suitable working conditions to print the tensile specimens of the ABS and carbon fiber PLA thermoplastics by using the fused deposition modeling technique. The process was optimized to identify the most influential factor, and the desired optimum condition was achieved at which the maximum tensile strength was reported. The produced prediction expression can be used to predict the tensile strength of ABS and carbon fiber PLA filaments. Practical implications: The results obtained from the experimental investigation are useful to get an insight into the FDM process and working limits to print the parts by using the ABS and carbon fiber PLA material for various industrial and structural applications. Social implications: The results will be useful in choosing the suitable thermoplastic filament for the various prototyping and structural applications. The products that require freedom in design and are difficult to produce by most of the conventional techniques can be produced at low cost and in less time by the fused deposition modeling technique. Originality/value: The process optimization shows the practical exposures to state an optimum working condition to print the ABS and carbon fiber PLA tensile specimens by using the FDM technique. The carbon fiber PLA shows better strength than ABS thermoplastic material. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS); Additive manufacturing process (AM); Carbon fiber polylactic acid (CPLA);

Polylactic Acid (PLA) polymer matrix was enriched with Multi Wall Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNT) at various concentrations, to fabricate 3D-printed parts by the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) technology. The effect of the nanofiller loading at the mechanical, thermal, electrical, thermomechanical, and antibacterial performance of the novel nanocomposites fabricated in this work was investigated. The filler loading of 5 wt.% was also tested to reveal its electrothermal Joule heating performance. The antibacterial properties of the nanocomposites were examined through a screening process, against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). For loadings of 1 wt.% and higher the mechanical properties were significantly improved. The 5 wt.% loaning showed measurable antibacterial performance. The nanocomposites prepared herein can be characterized as multifunctional materials, suitable for various industrial applications, such as sensors fabrication, health monitoring devices, etc. © 2021 The Author(s).

Focused on the formulation of positive electrodes composed of polypropylene, LiFePO4 as active material, and conductive additives, advantages and drawbacks of both additive manufacturing technologies, are thoroughly discussed from the electrochemical, electrical, morphological and mechanical perspectives. Based on these preliminary results, strategies to further optimize the electrochemical performances are proposed. Through a comprehensive modeling study, the enhanced electrochemical suitability at high current densities of various complex three-dimensional lithium-ion battery architectures, in comparison with classical two-dimensional planar design, is highlighted. Finally, the direct printing capability of the complete lithium-ion battery by means of multi-materials printing options processes is examined. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Composites; Electrodes; Lithium-ion battery; Material extrusion; Powder bed fusion","3D printers; Additives; Extrusion; Ions; Iron compounds; Lithium compounds; Phosphorus compounds; Polypropylenes; Reinforced plastics; Additive manufacturing technology; Comprehensive model; Conductive additives; Electrochemical performance; High current densities; Multi materials; Positive electrodes; Thermoplastic materials; Lithium-ion batteries","","","","","Université de Picardie Jules Verne; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF; Région Hauts-de-France","This work was supported by the Fonds Européen de Développement Régional (FEDER), the Région Hauts-de-France and the Université de Picardie Jules Verne (UPJV).

Between them, the technology FDM (Fused Deposition Modelling) has the greatest application in the industry due to the low cost and simplified operations. This technology is suitable for 3D-printing of various polymers (PET, ABS, PLA, PETG, etc.), which after preliminary treatment can be metallised by electroless deposition in order to obtain an even metal coating. The present paper describes investigations of some properties of nickel or copper coatings, electroless deposited from two kinds of solutions on 3D-printed and on cast under pressure ABS samples. For deposition of electroless nickel or copper coatings with good adhesion, the influence of the pre-treatment operations was also evaluated in both cases upon deposition on 3D-printed ABS samples with different resolutions (0.8 or 0.25 mm,) and on cast under pressure ABS samples. The thickness of the deposited layers was determined gravimetrically; the morphology and the elemental composition of the layers were examined by SEM or EDS, respectively; the surface roughness of the ABS samples was measured by AFM, and the adhesion of the metal layers was evaluated by a standard test with an adhesive tape (type Test-Method ASTM D 3359-83). © 2021 Institute of Materials Finishing Published by Taylor & Francis on behalf of the Institute.","3D printing; copper layers; electroless deposition; nickel layers; polymer details","Adhesion; Adhesives; Costs; Electroless plating; Fused Deposition Modeling; Metals; Morphology; Nickel coatings; Plastic coatings; Polyethylene terephthalates; Surface roughness; Testing; Copper coatings; Deposited layer; Different resolutions; Electroless nickel; Elemental compositions; Fused deposition modelling; Polymer samples; Preliminary treatment; ABS resins","","","","","National Centre for Mechatronics and Clean Technologies, (BG05M2OP001-1.001-0008); Bulgarian National Science Fund, BNSF; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","This research has been carried out within the Project DN 19/1, ‘Metallisation of dielectric materials using innovative environmental solutions’, funded by the National Science Fund (Bulgaria).

This study proposes a Design for AM (DfAM) method for hot stamping dies which exploits the benefit of lattice structures’ reduced thermal conductivity. The term effective cooling area of a cooling channel is introduced and is used for lattice structure integration into a hot stamping die. Four hot stamping dies with 4 different effective cooling areas were AMed using selective laser melting and subsequently tested in the hot stamping of AA7075 aluminum alloy blanks under cyclic loading conditions. Temperature evolutions, for both the blank and die, are presented with associated computed cooling rates. The analysis of the results shows that the proposed lattice structure AMed stamping dies significantly improve the cooling performance of a hot stamping die with printing times reduced by at least 12% compared to traditionally manufactured AM dies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Cooling performance; Hot stamping; Lattice structures","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Cooling; Cyclic loads; Design for manufacturability; Dies; Forging machines; Hot stamping; Selective laser melting; Thermal conductivity; AA7075 aluminum alloy; Cooling channels; Cooling performance; Cyclic loading conditions; Design flexibility; Lattice structures; Stamping dies; Temperature evolution; Stamping","","","","","","","Merklein M., Wieland M., Lechner M., Bruschi S., Ghiotti A., Hot stamping of boron steel sheets with tailored properties: a review, J.

Such ability can improve the interaction between implant materials and surrounding bone leading to long-term successful orthopedic implants. Selective Laser Melting (SLM) capability to produce high quality Ti6Al4V porous implants is in great demand towards orthopedic biomaterials. In this study, Ti6Al4V cellular structures were designed, modeled, SLM produced and characterized targeting orthopedic implants. For that purpose, a set of tools is proposed to overcome SLM limited accuracy to produce porous biomaterials with desired dimensions and mechanical properties. Morphological analyses were performed to evaluate the dimensional deviations noticed between the model CAD and the SLM produced structures. Tensile tests were carried out to estimate the elastic modulus of the Ti6Al4V cellular structures. The present work proposes a design methodology showing the linear correlations found for the dimensions, the porosity and the elastic modulus when comparing the model CAD designs with Ti6Al4V structures by SLM. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cellular structures; Design tools; Elastic modulus; Selective laser melting; Ti6Al4V","Alloys; Biocompatible Materials; Lasers; Materials Testing; Porosity; Titanium; Aluminum alloys; Cellular automata; Computer aided design; Elastic moduli; Implants (surgical); Melting; Metal testing; Selective laser melting; Tensile testing; Ternary alloys; Topology; biomaterial; ti6al4v alloy; titanium; unclassified drug; alloy; biomaterial; titanium alloy (TiAl6V4); Design Methodology; Dimensional deviation; Mechanical performance; Morphological analysis; Orthopedic biomaterials; Orthopedic implant; Selective laser melting (SLM); Topological properties; Article; cell structure; chemical structure; comparative study; computer aided design; controlled study; finite element analysis; mechanics; porosity; powder; priority journal; selective laser melting; surface area; tensile strength; Young modulus; laser; materials testing; Titanium alloys","","titanium, 7440-32-6; Alloys, ; Biocompatible Materials, ; Titanium, ; titanium alloy (TiAl6V4), ","","","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000018 – HAMaBICo, PTDC/EMS-TEC/5422/2014_ADAPTPROSTHESIS, SFRH/BD/128657/2017, UID/EEA/04436/2019)","This work was supported by FCT through the grant SFRH/BD/128657/2017 and the projects PTDC/EMS-TEC/5422/2014_ADAPTPROSTHESIS , NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000018 – HAMaBICo and UID/EEA/04436/2019 .","Arabnejad S., Johnston R.B., Ann J., Singh B., Tanzer M., Pasini D., High-strength porous biomaterials for bone replacement : a strategy to assess the interplay between cell morphology, mechanical properties, bone ingrowth and manufacturing constraints, Acta Biomater., 30, pp. 345-356, (2016); Ataee A., Li Y., Brandt M., Wen C., Ultrahigh-strength titanium gyroid scaffolds manufactured by selective laser melting (SLM) for bone implant applications, Acta Mater., 158, pp. 354-368, (2018); Bagheri Z.S., Melancon D., Liu L., Johnston R.B., Pasini D., Compensation strategy to reduce geometry and mechanics mismatches in porous biomaterials built with Selective Laser Melting, J.

Additive manufacturing (AM) provides a single step freeform manufacturing process that not only fabricates the complex geometries but also tailors the properties of the printed parts profoundly. In the selective laser melting (SLM) technique, the process parameters (PPs) and scanning strategy show the remarkable effect on the microstructure, the properties, and the size accuracy of as-built parts. Impurity pick-up during the AM process is an unintended incident altering the microstructure and thermomechanical properties of fabricated parts significantly. In this paper, slightly Ni-rich NiTi powder is utilized to fabricate the NiTi tubes with three different thicknesses via the SLM method. It is shown that the bidirectional scanning strategy results in the size deviation of thin-wall tubes. Transformation temperatures (TTs) of the as-fabricated samples are assessed and compared with those of the starting powder. A large shift in TTs is found between the powder and the SLM tubes. The x-ray diffraction pattern shows the martensite phase at room temperature for the starting powder, while the as-built tubes are in the austenite phase coexisting with a secondary phase of Ti-rich oxide. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirms Ti-rich Ti4Ni2Ox precipitates form along the grain boundaries. The characterization of tubes under pure torsional loading shows the localized shear strain on the tube surface. The thermomechanical behavior of the as-fabricated tubes is investigated and shown to exhibit superelastic response with a stable transformation strain of 2.3% after 10 cycles. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Digital image correlation; NiTi; Selective laser melting; Shape memory alloys; Superelasticity; Torsion","Additives; Binary alloys; Fabrication; Grain boundaries; Microstructure; Scanning electron microscopy; Selective laser melting; Shear strain; Titanium metallography; Titanium oxides; Tubes (components); Unloading; Bi-directional scanning; Engineering applications; Microstructure characterization; NiTi shape memory alloys; Selective laser melting (SLM); Thermo-mechanical behaviors; Thermomechanical properties; Transformation temperatures; alloy; correlation; digital image; elasticity; microstructure; torsion; Shape-memory alloy","","","","","ARMD; NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate; Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, ARMD","The U.

With this scaling of the digital 3D model, many important architectural and decorative details are lost, and some elements lose their stiffness. Printed 3D models are now used to create specialised museum exhibitions that allow visitors to get to know them kinesthetically. This ability to touch objects applies not only to visually impaired people, but to all interested visitors. The paper describes the preparation of a digital 3D model (D3DM) dedicated to 3D printing by decomposing the real model into sub-models and using different scaling values for individual elements.

The as-built sample showed epitaxial grains including sub-structures, whereas recrystallisation occurred in the HIP-treated samples. Furthermore, carbide particles appeared at the grain boundaries, and the γ’ phase formed extensively. The sample that was subjected to HIP-solution-treatment and aging (STA) contained a larger fraction of carbide and γ’ phase compared to the HIP sample, with a needle-shaped topologically close-packed (TCP) phase also generated inside the γ matrix. The yield and tensile-strengths increased by approximately 60% after HIP, and the elongation increased by 0.8%. However, the HIP-STA sample underwent a significant decrease in elongation by TCP phase.

One solution to this problem is to adopt a collaborative additive manufacturing system that employs multiple printers/extruders working simultaneously to improve productivity by reducing the process makespan. However, very limited research is available to address the major challenges in the co-scheduling of printing path scanning for different extruders. Existing studies lack: (i) a consideration of the impact of sub-path partitions and simultaneous printing of multiple layers on the multi-extruder printing makespan; and (ii) efficient algorithms to deal with the multiple decision-making involved. This article develops an improved method by first breaking down printing paths on different printing layers into sub-paths and assigning these generated sub-paths to different extruders. A mathematical model is formulated for the co-scheduling problem, and a hybrid algorithm with sequential solution procedures integrating an evolutionary algorithm and a heuristic is customized to multiple decision-making in the co-scheduling for collaborative printing. The performance was compared with the most recent research, and the results demonstrated further makespan reduction when sub-path partition or the simultaneous printing of multiple layers is considered. This article discusses the impacts of process setups on makespan reduction, providing a quantitative tool for guiding process development. © Copyright © 2020 “IISE”.","co-scheduling; Collaborative additive manufacturing; hybrid heuristic algorithm; manufacturing systems; process planning systems","Additives; Decision making; Evolutionary algorithms; Extruders; Productivity; Scheduling; Additive manufacturing process; Hybrid algorithms; Multiple layers; Path-scanning; Process development; Quantitative tool; Recent researches; Solution procedure; 3D printers","","","","","High-Performance Materials Institute at the Florida A&M University-Florida State University College of Engineering, (MSEC2019-3005, V001T02A042); National Science Foundation, NSF, (1646897, 1901109, CMMI-1901109, HRD-1646897)","This research is partially supported by two NSF grants CMMI-1901109 and HRD-1646897.

However, the materials available for SLM production remain limited, restricting the industrial adoption of the technology. The mechanical properties and microstructure of many aluminium alloys have not been fully explored, as their manufacturability using SLM is extremely challenging. This study investigates the effect of laser power, hatch spacing and scanning speed on the mechanical and microstructural properties of as-fabricated aluminium 2024 alloy (AA2024) manufactured using SLM. The results reveal that almost crack-free structures with high relative density (99.9%) and Archimedes density (99.7%) have been achieved. It is shown that when using low energy density (ED) levels, large cracks and porosities are a major problem, owing to incomplete fusion; however, small gas pores are prevalent at high-energy densities due to the dissolved gas particles in the melt pool. An inversely proportional relationship between ED and microhardness has also been observed. Lower ED decreases the melt pool size and temperature gradients but increases the cooling rate, creating a fine-grained microstructure, which restricts dislocation movement, therefore increasing the microhardness. The highest microhardness (116 HV0.2), which was obtained from one of the lowest EDs used (100 J/mm3), is 45% higher than as-cast AA2024-0, but 17% lower than wrought AA2024-T6 alloy. © 2020, The Author(s).","AA2024; Additive manufacturing; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Process parameters; Selective laser melting","Aluminum alloys; Cracks; Fabrication; Melting; Microhardness; Microstructure; Fine-grained microstructure; High relative densities; Micro-structural properties; Microstructure and mechanical properties; Properties and microstructures; Proportional relationships; Selective laser melting (SLM); Traditional manufacturing; Selective laser melting","","","","","ASTUTE 2020; Llywodraeth Cymru; Cardiff University; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER; School of Psychology, Cardiff University; School of Chemistry, Cardiff University; ministry of national education of Turkey","This research is supported by the ministry of national education of Turkey and ASTUTE 2020 (Advanced Sustainable Manufacturing Technologies).

The concept of sustainable manufacturing has emerged to address this scarcity and to minimise environmental degradation. 3D printing also known as additive manufacturing, could potentially reduce material wastage, energy consumption and resulting emissions. A 'techno-eco-efficiency' framework was developed to produce technically, economically, and environmentally feasible centrifugal pump impellers 3D printed using the fused filament fabrication process. Firstly, surface properties, geometric properties, build material properties, static structural and dynamic properties, and the hydraulic performance of impellers were assessed in order to investigate how process parameters, such as infill pattern, infill rate and reinforcement material affect the technical performance. Secondly, the eco-efficiency performance of technically suitable impellers was assessed using environmental life cycle assessment, life cycle costing tools and portfolio analysis. Thus, this 'techno-eco-efficiency' framework was used to achieve sustainable manufacturing and could act as a decision support tool for selecting cost-competitive, environmentally benign, and technically feasible products. Alternatively, it would assist product designers and manufacturers to minimise a trade-off between technical and resulting eco-efficiency performance.

Some SLA resins have very high Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) compared to metal, so SLA 3D printed microwave filters can have frequency responses that are strongly dependent on temperature - a serious problem for narrow band filters. The presented technique overcomes this limitation, and in fact yields an SLA 3D printed filter with better temperature stability than an uncompensated metal 3D printed or a conventionally machined metal filter. Two 3D printed, temperature compensated microwave cavity notch filters have been fabricated using stereolithography (SLA) resins. Both use two different values of CTE for compensation. The 3D printed plastic parts are electroplated with copper. One filter consists of a resonant cavity with the TE011 mode coupled to a TE10 waveguide. The other is a TE101 resonant cavity coupled to TE10 waveguide. As temperature increases, the side walls of the cavities grow, lowering the resonant frequency. At the same time, for the TE011 cavity, an end-wall tuning plunger made of stereolithography resin with a higher CTE than the cavity walls expands at a faster rate. The end wall expansion increases the resonant frequency. In the case of the TE101 cavity, a metallic plunger expands much more slowly than the cavity and effectively withdraws as temperature increases, which increases the resonant frequency.  © 2013 IEEE.","Cavity resonators; filters; microwave; plating; stereolithography; thermal expansion; three-dimensional printing","Cavity resonators; Expansion; Frequency response; Metals; Microwave filters; Microwaves; Natural frequencies; Notch filters; Plastic parts; Resins; Stereolithography; Thermal expansion; 3-D printing; Complicated structures; Faster rates; Microwave cavity; Narrow band filter; Temperature compensated; Temperature increase; Temperature stability; Waveguide filters","","","","","SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, SLAC","This work was supported by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.","Sage G.P.L., 3D printed waveguide slot array antennas, Ieee Access, 4, pp. 1258-1265, (2016); Le Sage G.P., Dielectric steering of a 3-D printed microwave slot array, Ieee Antennas Wireless Propag.

However, the spherical powder is expensive. In order to reduce the cost, this study first ball mills the pure titanium (CP-Ti) powder of hydrogenation-dehydrogenation (HDH). At a high speed and within a short period, the particle size distribution of the powder at a high rotation speed for 15 min is 12–45 μm with an angle of repose 34.3°. Then, the ball milling of titanium was mixed spherical powder with a wide grain size range up to 100 μm. This study presents the results of using SLM to produce CP-Ti parts starting from powder with mixed powder, in a different ratio between modified powder and spherical powder. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of SLM-parts of 8:2 ratio has been improved to 507 MPa, and the UTS of parts of 7:3 ratio has been improved to 522 MPa. © 2020 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining Published by Taylor & Francis on behalf of the Institute.","ball milling;

This capability provides LSAM with potentials in a variety of industries, including aerospace and automotive manufacturing. Product quality and production efficiency are two main concerns, as LSAM is implemented. It has been proven that print surface temperature is a major factor that impacts the quality of final products. Therefore, it needs to be controlled throughout the process. As an infrared camera is implemented, the real-time data of surface temperature of parts are available. A dynamic approach is studied in this article to perform real-time layer time control based on the real-time data from the infrared camera to improve both product quality and production efficiency. A regression model is formulated and proved to fit the cooling dynamics. To deal with the layerwise change of cooling dynamics, due to humidity and airflow, the Gaussian process is used to keep the regression model updated. The regression model together with the Gaussian process can predict the surface temperature of a part accurately, even in a dynamic environment. This method to predict surface temperature is then combined into an optimization model for real-time layer time control. Specifically, more than one position on the surface is monitored and considered in the optimization model, and the resulting layer time for each layer by solving the optimization model has the quality requirement satisfied and improves production efficiency. The improved system performance is presented in a case study. This article provides practitioners of LSAM with a useful tool to improve the process through manufacturing automation. Note to Practitioners - Carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic material is used for large-scale additive manufacturing (LSAM) to fabricate parts in large size. This technology is new compared with other additive manufacturing technologies, and several key problems are to be addressed before it is widely applied in industry. One issue is product quality, which depends largely on print surface temperature. Quality problems caused by improper print surface temperature include cracking, warping, and deformation. Another problem is the operation inefficiency, which results in a high cost. Currently, it takes hours to print a single part. This article provides a framework to improve both quality and efficiency of LSAM by employing the real-time data captured from the infrared thermal camera. Specifically, a regression model is formulated to describe the surface temperature with high accuracy. Then, a layer time control method is proposed to schedule printing operations in real time to guarantee high printing efficiency and quality.  © 2020 IEEE.","Fused filament fabrication (FFF); Gaussian process; large-scale additive manufacturing (LSAM); layer time control; thermal image","3D printers; Additives; Aerospace industry; Atmospheric temperature; Efficiency; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Graphite fibers; Infrared devices; Optimization; Regression analysis; Reinforced plastics; Surface properties; Temperature indicating cameras; Additive manufacturing technology; Automotive manufacturing; Carbon fiber reinforced; Infrared thermal-camera; Manufacturing Automation; Optimization modeling; Production efficiency; Quality requirements; Process control","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CMMI-1922739); National Science Foundation, NSF","This work was supported in part by NSF under Grant CMMI-1922739.","Standard Terminology for Additive Manufacturing Technologies, (2012); Ngo T.D., Kashani A., Imbalzano G., Nguyen K.T.Q., Hui D., Additive manufacturing (3D printing): A review of materials, methods, applications and challenges, Compos.

Along with mechanical performance, vibrational behavior of selective laser melted parts becomes a paramount to enhance the part quality and repeatability of the process. This paper investigates the effect of SLM process parameters on the vibrational behavior of AlSi10Mg to enhance the damping capacity. The range for laser power, scanning speed, hatch spacing were selected as 290 to 370 W, 1.0 to 2.2 m/s and 50 to 150 μm, respectively. The vibrational characteristics such as natural frequency and modal damping were measured using fast Fourier transform (FFT) analyser and were compared with numerical analyses. Regression models were developed using response surface methodology (RSM). The natural frequency and damping were affected mostly by the scan speed. Based on the results obtained, a maximum modal damping of 1.0348% was achieved at 290 W laser power, 2.2 m/s scan speed and 150 μm hatch spacing. © 2021 Old City Publishing.

While nature is often the inspiration in fabricating static structures, it also plays a vital role in 4D printing. In order to survive and protect themselves from harsh environments, both plants and animals are equipped with unique movements and locomotion. However, the process of fabricating bioinspired 4D structures is complex and challenging. This review provides an overview of nature-inspired actuation to the realisation by 4D printing. Firstly, an understanding of nature actuations is briefly depicted. Next, the processes involved in the fabrication of 4D printed parts are described. Lastly, the challenges and potential applications are discussed. © 2021 Engineers Australia.","4D printing; additive manufacturing; biomimicry; multimaterial printing; nature-inspired actuation","Additives; Biomimetics; 4d printing; Biomimicry; Environmental stimuli; Harsh environment; Materials design; Multi materials; Multimaterial printing; Nature-inspired actuation; Printing materials; Static structures; 3D printers","","","","","","","Adam G., Benouhiba A., Rabenorosoa K., Clevy C., Cappelleri D.J.J.A.I.S., 4D Printing: Enabling Technology for Microrobotics Applications, Advanced Intelligent Systems, 3, 5, (2021); Ahmed A., Arya S., Gupta V., Furukawa H., Khosla A., 4D Printing: Fundamentals, Materials, Applications and Challenges, Polymer, 228, (2021); Bajpai A., Baigent A., Raghav S., Bradaigh C.O., Koutsos V., Radacsi N., 4D Printing: Materials, Technologies, and Future Applications in the Biomedical Field, Sustainability, 12, 24, (2020); Carlo M., Metin S., A Biomimetic Climbing Robot Based on the Gecko, Journal of Bionic Engineering, 3, 3, pp. 115-125, (2006); Champeau M., Heinze D.A., Viana T.N., de Souza E.R., Chinellato A.C., Titotto S., 4D Printing of Hydrogels: A Review, Advanced Functional Materials, 30, 31, (2020); Chen D., Liu Q., Han Z., Zhang J., Song H., Wang K., Song Z., Wen S., Zhou Y., Yan C., 4D Printing Strain Self‐Sensing and Temperature Self‐Sensing Integrated Sensor–Actuator with Bioinspired Gradient Gaps, Advanced Science, 7, 13, (2020); Chen Z., Zhao D., Liu B., Nian G., Li X., Yin J., Qu S., Yang W., 3D Printing of Multifunctional Hydrogels, Advanced Functional Materials, 29, 20, (2019); Chi Y., Tang Y., Liu H., Yin J., Leveraging Monostable and Bistable Pre‐Curved Bilayer Actuators for High‐Performance Multitask Soft Robots, Advanced Materials Technologies, 5, 9, (2020); Choi J., Kwon O.-C., Jo W., Lee H.J., Moon M.-W., 4D Printing Technology: A Review, 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing, 2, 4, pp. 159-167, (2015); Clegg J.R., Wagner A.M., Shin S.R., Hassan S., Khademhosseini A., Peppas N.A., Modular Fabrication of Intelligent Material-tissue Interfaces for Bioinspired and Biomimetic Devices, Progress in Materials Science, 106, (2019); Correa D., Papadopoulou A., Guberan C., Jhaveri N., Reichert S., Menges A., Tibbits S., 3D-printed Wood: Programming Hygroscopic Material Transformations, 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing, 2, 3, pp. 106-116, (2015); Cui H., Miao S., Esworthy T., Lee S.-J., Zhou X., Hann S.Y., Webster T.J., Harris B.T., Zhang L.G., A Novel Near-infrared Light Responsive 4D Printed Nanoarchitecture with Dynamically and Remotely Controllable Transformation, Nano Research, 12, 6, pp. 1381-1388, (2019); Ding Z., Yuan C., Peng X., Wang T., Qi H.J., Dunn M.L., Direct 4D Printing via Active Composite Materials, Science Advances, 3, 4, (2017); Faber J.A., Arrieta A.F., Studart A.R., Bioinspired Spring Origami, Science, 359, 6382, pp. 1386-1391, (2018); Gladman A.S., Matsumoto E.A., Nuzzo R.G., Mahadevan L., Lewis J.A.J.N., Biomimetic 4D Printing, Nature Materials, 15, 4, pp. 413-418, (2016); Gonzalez-Henriquez C.M., Sarabia-Vallejos M.A., Rodriguez-Hernandez J., Polymers for Additive Manufacturing and 4D-printing: Materials, Methodologies, And Biomedical Applications.

The geometric shapes of polymer powder particles and fibres are represented by multi-sphere particles and individual cylinders with round ends, respectively. The numerical model can help to understand the flow dynamics of composite powder particles and the formation mechanisms of voids in powder packing processes. The numerical model has been utilised to analyse the effects of packing parameters on the packing quality of the powder bed. The simulation results suggest that the increase of the powder layer thickness is beneficial for increasing the packing density and lowering the surface roughness of the powder bed. A high roller spreading velocity degrades the packing quality of the powder bed. A small number of fibres in the composite powder particles are in favour of the packing quality, while excessive fibres reduce the packing quality of the powder bed. © 2021 The Author(s).

Furthermore, the extent to which residual stresses from the FFF build process affect the dynamic load bearing characteristics has not been addressed. In this work, simulations and experiments are conducted for cylindrical nylon specimens fabricated with two different internal closed-cell cavity structures to assess the influence of the entrapped fluid and the FFF residual stresses on the state of stress during high strain-rate impact. The demonstrated 2-stage computational approach includes a thermomechanical model of the FFF build to calculate residual stress and distortion, which forms the initial state for a subsequently executed dynamic impact model using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to capture the effects of air within the internal cavities. Dynamic displacement boundary conditions for the FSI simulations are identified using digital image correlation (DIC), obtained from impact experiments on the FFF specimens performed using split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) tests. Findings reveal that FFF residual stresses significantly influence the stress–strain response during dynamic impact, even at strain rates of 500–600 s−1. In addition, while the influences of both FFF residual stress and FSI vary with internal cellular structure, the study reveals that their coupled effects must be considered to accurately characterize the impact behavior. Validity of the 2-stage numerical approach, as well as significance of FFF residual stress and the influence of FSI, are justified by comparing numerical predictions with experimental measurements, and observing root-mean-square stress errors within 12.77% and 11.87%, and peak stress errors within 1.93% and 1.34% for the two specimens. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic impact; Fluid–structure interaction; Fused filament fabrication; Material extrusion; Numerical modeling; Residual stress","Computer aided software engineering; Dynamic loads; Fabrication; Hydrodynamics; Mechanical testing; Residual stresses; Computational approach; D. digital image correlation (DIC); Dynamic displacements; Dynamic impact models; Numerical predictions; Smoothed particle hydrodynamics; Split Hopkinson pressure bars; Thermomechanical model; Strain rate","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1636306, CMMI-1636306, CMMI-1661246, CMMI-1726435, CMMI-1762722); National Science Foundation, NSF","Sunny and Malik acknowledge the support of U.S. National Science Foundation , grant no.

The progress is driven by improvements in machine technology, enabling the processing of finer powders to produce homogeneous, dense final parts. However, the strong cohesive forces of fine metal powders impair flowability, packing behaviour and thus the properties relevant for powder spreading. This paper investigates the impact of powder condition and spreading parameters on green and sintered density using an Analysis of Variance. Parts from dried and from untreated powder are printed, varying in layer thickness, roller diameter, supply-to-spread ratio, translational and rotational roller speed. Powder drying increases the statistical impact of the spreading parameter and improves the green density, while the sintered density remains unchanged. Layer thickness and roller diameter have the most significant effect. Furthermore, the spreading parameter combinations that resulted in a high green density also provided a high sintered density. © 2021 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining Published by Taylor & Francis on behalf of the Institute.","Additive manufacturing; green density; metal binder jetting; powder drying; powder moisture; powder spreading; sintered density","3D printers; Rollers (machine components); Sintering; Throughput; Additive manufacturing process; High throughput; Layer thickness; Machine technology; Packing behaviour; Parameter combination; Parameter impacts; Sintered density; Powder metals","","","","","","","Mostafaei A., Elliott A.M., Barnes J.E., Et al., Binder jet 3D printing–process parameters, materials, properties, and challenges, Prog Mater Sci, (2020); Gokuldoss P.K., Kolla S., Eckert J., Additive manufacturing processes: selective laser melting, electron beam melting and binder jetting-selection guidelines, Materials (Basel), 10, (2017); Sachs E., Cima M., Williams P., Et al., Three dimensional printing: rapid tooling and prototypes directly from a CAD model, J Eng Indust, 114, 481-488, (1992); Lores A., Azurmendi N., Agote I., Et al., A review on recent developments in binder jetting metal additive manufacturing: materials and process characteristics, Powder Metall, 62, pp. 267-296, (2019); Wieland S., Petzoldt F., Binder jet 3D-printing for metal additive manufacturing: applications and innovative approaches, Ceramic Forum International, 500, pp. E1-E5, (2016); Godlinski D., Veltl G.; Gonzalez J.A., Mireles J., Lin Y., Et al., Characterization of ceramic components fabricated using binder jetting additive manufacturing technology, Ceram Int, 42, pp. 10559-10564, (2016); Lv X., Ye F., Cheng L., Et al., Binder jetting of ceramics: powders, binders, printing parameters, equipment, and post-treatment, Ceram Int, 45, pp. 12609-12624, (2019); Miyanaji H., Zhang S., Lassell A., Et al., Process development of porcelain ceramic material with binder jetting process for dental applications.

Likewise, the support structure space (3S) was not utilised yet to prolong the investigation in this arena. Build time reduction leads to faster production and lower fabrication cost of the part. This paper proposes a critical thinking approach that limits build time to a lesser value, for part building in RP processes using a generic algorithm. The support structure (2S) volume is one of the dominant factors in reducing the build time. The proposed algorithm replaces the 2S volume by the 3S volume to find the best part deposition orientation. Construction of the bounding box, computation of the 3S volume and orientation of the part are discussed in the development phase of the algorithm. The verification and validation of sample-fabricated parts on FDM system have been done by comparing the outcomes obtained against the numerically estimated values.

The authors investigated isogrid-stiffened spherical shells produced by additive manufacturing. A Ti-6Al-4V, 1.12-m-diam lightweight structural shell capable of surviving a Venus surface environment was designed and assessed via analytical methods and finite element modeling. Subscale components (200 mm diameter) were designed, analyzed, and fabricated using laser powder bed fusion and tested under hydrostatic external pressure at ambient temperatures for model validation. A subscale sphere was successfully tested under Venuslike pressures and temperatures at a hot isostatic press facility. It was found that additively manufactured isogrid shells could lead to significant mass, cost, and schedule savings, freeing resources for increased science return from future missions. © 2020 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

The order of magnitude scaling (OMS) technique was used to develop an appropriate dimensionless formulation, to obtain asymptotic expressions, and to determine the limits of validity. Nonlinear finite element simulations of welding procedures were performed to validate the asymptotic model; plasticity and temperature dependent materials properties for structural steel, stainless steel, and aluminum were considered. Thermal stresses cause plasticity when the temperature reaches a critical temperature termed the first yield temperature. The model developed is valid when the first yield isotherm is elongated, which is the case for most welding and metal additive manufacturing applications. A rigorous novel expression for the criterion of applicability is presented and utilized for prediction of the width of the plastic zone surrounding a weld or additive manufacturing bead. Extrapolations beyond the region of applicability show a consistent trend, which is captured in the form of a general dimensionless empirical expression. This work establishes the foundation for the estimation of forces and distortions induced by welding or additive manufacturing processes, and also the incorporation of effects of departure from idealizations.

However, online quality estimation is challenging because high-frequency stream data derived from in situ metrology have to be processed in a timely manner to figure out the complicated interactions among material, machine, and part. To tackle such issue, this article proposes an intelligent AM metrology (IAMM) architecture to decouple and evaluate quality variations caused by material properties, machine issues, and process parameters when building an AM part. The IAMM architecture can also estimate the online layer-to-layer quality (e.g., roughness and density of an AM part) by applying the robust parameters derived from the uniform design (UD) method via the enhanced automatic virtual metrology technology in a parallel computing environment, as soon as the microfeatures of melt-pools and the macrofeatures of each layer are extracted. In addition, the associated indices and features in the IAMM architecture can also be used to evaluate the defects caused by machine issues in the given process parameters. The results of case studies validate the applicability of the IAMM architecture and show that the proposed estimation models are prospective for future closed-loop control in an AM process. Note to Practitioners - The proposed intelligent AM metrology (IAMM) architecture can be implemented modularly in a metal additive manufacturing (AM) machine that possesses the capability of estimating the coating and printing qualities of the AM process by extracting features from the optical data of the melt pools and chamber layer by layer. The estimated indices and qualities can be derived online using parallel computation to timely diagnose the machine issues and control the process of the next layer. Hence, when an AM machine is equipped with the IAMM architecture, it can efficiently manufacture a 3-D part with reduced defects in real time.  © 2020 IEEE.","Automatic virtual metrology (AVM); in situ metrology; intelligent AM metrology (IAMM) architecture; meltpool; metal additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Closed loop control systems; Data streams; Defects; Frequency estimation; Lakes; Closed-loop control; Extracting features; High frequency HF; In-situ metrology; Parallel Computation; Parallel-computing environment; Process parameters; Quality estimation; Process control","","","","","Tongtai Machine & Tool Company","The authors would like to thank Prof. Jinn-Tsong Tsai for supporting the experimental design and Tongtai Machine & Tool Company Ltd., Taiwan, for providing the utilities and supports in the study.","Hull C.W., Apparatus for Production of Three-dimensional Objects by Stereo Lithography, (1986); Ngo T.D., Kashani A., Imbalzano G., Nguyen K.T.Q., Hui D., Additive manufacturing (3D printing): A review of materials, methods, applications and challenges, Compos.

The aim of the present paper is to define mechanical properties such as compressive stress and Young’s Modulus and to estimate the ability of human bone cell strains to form biofilm on bioresorbable composites manufactured of polylactide and poly-l-lactide (PLA and PLLA) and hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate (HA and β-TCP) with Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) method. Methods: Microbiological tests were conducted on three variants of solid specimen made with additive laser technology. Samples with different chemical compositions were made with appropriate manufacturing parameters ensuring stability of both composite ingredients. Microbiological tests in vitro helped to determine cytotoxicity of specific samples toward bone cells. Results: The results obtained indicate significantly increased ability of osteoblasts to form colonies on the surface of materials with higher content of hydroxyapatite ceramics comparing to surfaces of lower hydroxyapatite content.

This present research is designed to quantify these parameters of the fusion bonding between individual filaments deposited during the 3D printing process. Polyamide 6 (PA6) specimens were prepared from both 3D printed single-layer and single-filament films. Also, to provide a benchmark material, 3D printed PA6 films prepared by the FFF process were further processed by using compression moulding (CM) to investigate whether the fusion bonding could be enhanced. An essential work of fracture method was employed to evaluate the fusion bonding between the filaments by determining the value of the specific essential work of fracture, we, and the associated experimental reproducibility. The higher value of we, and the relatively low degree of scatter determined for the benchmark material revealed that the extent and quality of fusion bonding attained when using only the FFF process clearly needed to be improved when parts are fabricated for practical applications. To study the effect of temperature on the fusion bonding, the structural detail and fracture surfaces of thin polymer films were studied, with the thermal history of the deposited filaments also being measured using a thermal camera. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","","Benchmarking; Film preparation; Fracture; Polymer films; 3D printing process; Effect of temperature; Essential work of fracture; Essential work of fracture methods; Fracture surfaces; Mechanical performance; Structural details; Thin polymer films; 3D printers","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC; University of Sydney, Usyd","The authors acknowledge the financial support of the Discovery Project (No. DP190102354) from the Australian Research Council.

Skilfully connecting AM and HIP creates a manufacturing process that unites the advantages of the two approaches. We demonstrate a production route for composite components by combining AM and HIP: a HIP capsule made of corrosion resistant steel is additively manufactured using Powder Bed Fusion with Laser Beam (LPBF). Before LPBF, the distortion and shrinkage of the capsule due to HIP is compensated by optimising the capsule’s geometry using Finite Element (FE) simulation of the HIP process. The capsule is filled with steel powder and manufactured by a conventional powder HIP. After HIP, the capsule remains as an outer layer on the component, so that a functional net-shape composite component is produced. Subsequent investigations show that a complex extruder screw segment can be successfully produced with a geometrical deviation smaller than 1.5%. © 2021 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining Published by Taylor & Francis on behalf of the Institute.","Additive manufacturing; Composite component; Geometry optimisation; Hot isostatic pressing; Near-net shape; Numerical simulation; Powder bed fusion","3D printers; Additives; Corrosion resistance; Laser beams; Sintering; Steel corrosion; Steel powder metallurgy; Composite components; Corrosion-resistant steel; Finite element simulations; Functional composites; Functional net; Geometrical deviations; Manufacturing process; Production route; Hot isostatic pressing","","","","","European Powder Metallurgy Association; Allianz Industrie Forschung, AiF; Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie, BMWi","Funding text 1: The research project 18968 N of the Research Association - Forschungsgesellschaft Stahlverformung e.

Post-process treatments have been also investigated, as methods to further improve the AM materials performance. On the contrary, still fewer data are available on AM materials ultimate static strength. The present paper is intended to present a comprehensive experimental and numerical static characterization of Ti6Al4V, 17-4PH, and AlSi10Mg alloys processed via selective laser melting (SLM). A dedicated set of specimen geometries was devised to induce desired multiaxial stress state, and experiments were carried out both on as built and machined AM samples. The results were employed to identify the constitutive behavior of the materials and to calibrate four different ductile damage models. The failure prediction capabilities of the tuned models were thoroughly analyzed and discussed. The overall mechanical properties and the ductility of the investigated alloys were estimated based on the experimental results and on the information provided by the tuned models. Additionally, a comparison with data collected on the corresponding wrought materials, performing the same experiments, was carried out. The results showed a limited reduction of yield and failure strength and a significant reduction in the ductility of AM materials with respect to their wrought counterparts. Moreover, for the less ductile alloys, a weaker dependence of the strain to fracture from the stress state was observed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Damage; Ductile fracture; Multiaxial tests","Additives; Damage detection; Ductility; Industrial research; Magnesium alloys; Selective laser melting; Silicon alloys; Strength of materials; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Constitutive behaviors; Ductile damage models; Failure prediction; High cycle fatigue; Materials performance; Multiaxial stress state; Selective laser melting (SLM); Static characterization; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Free University of Bozen, (TN2092)","The present study was partially funded by the Free University of Bozen , project Ma.M.De., grant number TN2092 .

The material response of PLA is viscoplastic and temperature-dependent, as is typically seen for thermoplastics. The inelastic deformation of printed PLA undergoes initial yielding, strain softening, and subsequent failure. The Three-Network (TN) constitutive model was employed in this work, which captures experimentally observed material response and consists of three molecular equilibrium and time-dependent viscous networks that act in parallel. The parameter identification was performed in accordance with experimental data from uniaxial testing and a validation experiment was carried out by loading plate with a hole and measuring its strain distribution using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) method, which was compared with the predictions from Finite Element Analysis (FEA). © 2021 Growing Science Ltd.

Polymers offer low frictional resistance to wear, so most of the engineering polymers find their increased usage in day-to-day industrial as well as domestic needs. The influence of many process controlling elements on the mechanical part properties is already being studied extensively, which demands the study of tribological characteristics like friction and wear rate under varying normal load (NL), sliding velocities (V) and part building orientations (PBO). The results showed a significant impact of the PBO and NL at various V on the tribological properties under various significant suitable sliding circumstances. Cracks were formed in the cylindrical tribometer specimens of Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) fabricated at low PBO when operated at high NL, and V. Vertical PBO to the FDM building platform in the layers form where a number of inter-layers can bear maximum NL at higher values of V resulted in uniform wear and low frictions. Friction was noticed very low at minimum NL when PBO was 0◦ (horizontal) and 90◦ (vertical), but increased at high NL between PBO of 15◦ to 60◦. The FDM parts improved compared to those from conventional manufacturing processes. © 2021.

This article presents the results of the thermodynamic flow analysis carried out on commercial designs of hotends, in the aim intending to identify the design parameters with a higher incidence in the mass flow of material output, so therefore, in the speed and quality of printing. Finite elements thermal analysis was carried out performed in order to characterize the effect of the materials and geometric design elements of the hotends. In this analysis the behavior of the commercial, the commercial melters' behavior and the effects caused by the changes in geometry and materials were obtained.

Owing to the advancement of additive manufacturing (AM), the development of design methods for additively manufactured lattice structures has extensively progressed, especiallyfor functionally graded lattice structures (FGLS). Despite plenty of available design frameworks, the application of AM constraints in the design of FGLS is limited to geometric issues. Further, there is a lack of design methods that consider the unique physical properties of additively manufactured parts, especially the anisotropic characteristics induced by AM processes. This paper proposes a novel method for the design of additively manufactured functionally graded lattice structures with the consideration of AM anisotropic properties. In addition, a customized anisotropic AM-Lattice material model that supports the design of FGLS through the density-variable topology optimization is proposed. Moreover, Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process in which the process-induced anisotropy of AM is clearly demonstrated is focused. The design method was validated by the three-point bending-beam design problem, a classical design problem for validating topology optimization. The results, showing agreements between simulations and experiments, prove the validity and practicality of the proposed method. © 2019, Korean Society for Precision Engineering.","Additive manufacturing; Anisotropic properties; Functionally graded lattice structure; Topology optimization","3D printers; Additives; Anisotropy; Design for manufacturability; Error analysis; Fused Deposition Modeling; Shape optimization; Structural optimization; Topology; Anisotropic property; Design frameworks; Functionally graded; Fused deposition modeling (FDM); Induced anisotropy; Lattice materials; Lattice structures; Three point bending beam; Structural design","","","","","Chung-Ang University Graduate Research Scholarship; Chung-Ang University, CAU; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea, MSIT, (2019R1A2C1002010)","Funding text 1:  This research was in part supported by the Chung-Ang University Graduate Research Scholarship in 2017 and by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No.2019R1A2C1002010).

As tied to the active application of AM to real-world practice, there have been significant efforts to improve energy efficiency and reduce energy cost in AM. Given this context, this study proposes a systematic approach that is uniquely designed to achieve energy-aware production scheduling for AM while it addresses both process-level and scheduling-level controls in an integrated fashion to ultimately save electricity cost. In particular for the process-level control, we first analyze and extract power demand patterns paired with the various process parameter settings. For the scheduling-level control, we formulate a production scheduling problem to minimize energy cost in response to time-varying electricity price as well as demand charge, which has been a common practice for calculating the electric bills of industrial consumers. Specifically, to realize energy-aware production scheduling, the selection of process parameters will be considered as a part of scheduling decisions so that peak power demand and energy consumption patterns can be flexibly adjusted by changing the process parameter setting. While considering the fused deposition modeling (FDM) as a fabrication method, this study conducts numerical experiments based on real-world data to demonstrate the improvement by the proposed approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Energy-aware production scheduling; Fused deposition modeling (FDM); Mixed integer linear program (MILP)","Additives; Automotive industry; Costs; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fused Deposition Modeling; Level control; Numerical methods; Power management; Production control; Scheduling; Conventional manufacturing; Fused deposition modeling (FDM); Manufacturing technologies; Numerical experiments; Production scheduling problems; Selection of process parameters; Three-dimensional (3D) printing; Time-varying electricity prices; Process control","","","","","","","Abikarram J.B., McConky K., Proano R., Energy cost minimization for unrelated parallel machine scheduling under real time and demand charge pricing, J.

On the other hand, owing to their relatively poor roughness, functional surfaces generated in AM have to be often finish machined. This research explored the prospect of turning this limitation around by pursuing a novel concept of additive texturing (AT) wherein the topography of an AM part is tailored in-process to entail textures that further enhance the functionality of an AM product. In this context, the limits of the selective laser melting process in printing metallic surface microfeatures were investigated as a precursor to realizing texture patterns comprising pillars, channels, and re-entrant structures. Following on from this, the efficacy of such textures in controlling the wetting behaviour of stainless steel AM surfaces was examined. The notion of AT is demonstrated in terms of its capability to generate hydrophobic AM surfaces with water contact angles exceeding 140°. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Hydrophobicity; Selective laser melting; Surface texturing; Wettability","Additives; Selective laser melting; Surface measurement; Textures; Topography; Functional surfaces; Geometric feature; Manufacturing process; Metallic surface; Texture patterns; Water contact angle; Wetting behaviour; Wetting control; Wetting","","","","","","","DebRoy T., Wei H., Zuback J., Mukherjee T., Elmer J., Milewski J., Beese A.M., Wilson-Heid A., De A., Zhang W., Additive manufacturing of metallic components–process, structure and properties, Prog.

Therefore, the main goal of this study is to assess the feasibility of using indirect fused deposition modeling to fabricate dental prosthesis made of ZrSiO4-glass composites. To achieve this goal, filaments were filled by 90% of ZrSiO4 and 50 μm glass spheres to fabricate prosthesis. Multivariable approach was applied to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method. Holding temperature, holding time, heating rate, and cooling rate were considered the control factors, while shrinkage, flexural strength, and process feasibility were the study responses. In addition, the flexural strength of materials was found between 25 and 85 MPa, while shrinkage fluctuated between 10 and 25%. © 2020 Cunico.

In recent years, stem cell therapies based on conjunctival stem cells (CjSCs) have become a potential solution for treating ocular surface diseases. However, neither an efficient culture of CjSCs nor the development of a minimally invasive ocular surface CjSC transplantation therapy has been reported. Here, we developed a robust in vitro expansion method for primary rabbit-derived CjSCs and applied digital light processing (DLP)-based bioprinting to produce CjSC-loaded hydrogel micro-constructs for injectable delivery. Expansion medium containing small molecule cocktail generated fast dividing and highly homogenous CjSCs for more than 10 passages in feeder-free culture. Bioprinted hydrogel micro-constructs with tunable mechanical properties enabled the 3D culture of CjSCs while supporting viability, stem cell phenotype, and differentiation potency into conjunctival goblet cells. These hydrogel micro-constructs were well-suited for scalable dynamic suspension culture of CjSCs and were successfully delivered to the bulbar conjunctival epithelium via minimally invasive subconjunctival injection. This work integrates novel cell culture strategies with bioprinting to develop a clinically relevant injectable-delivery approach for CjSCs towards the stem cell therapies for the treatment of ocular surface diseases. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","3D culture; Bioprinting; Conjunctival stem cell; Injectable delivery; Ocular surface regeneration; Stem cell therapy","Animals; Bioprinting; Cell Differentiation; Hydrogels; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Quality of Life; Rabbits; Stem Cells; Tissue Engineering; Biomechanics; Cell culture; Disease control; Hydrogels; hydrogel; Digital light processing; Dynamic suspension; Minimally invasive; Quality of life; Small molecules; Stem cell phenotypes; Stem cell therapy; Transplantation therapy; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; bioprinting; bulbar conjunctiva; cell differentiation; cell viability; conjunctiva epithelium; controlled study; feeder cell; goblet cell; in vitro study; minimally invasive procedure; nonhuman; ocular surface disease; priority journal; stem cell expansion; stem cell transplantation; subconjunctival drug administration; suspension cell culture; three dimensional cell culture; tissue regeneration; animal; hydrogel; Leporidae; quality of life; stem cell; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; Stem cells","","Hydrogels, ","","","University of California, San Diego, UCSD; National Cancer Institute, NCI, (P30CA023100); National Science Foundation, NSF, (1937653, DGE-1650112); National Eye Institute, NEI, (R21EY031122); National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, NIBIB, (R01EB021857); National Institutes of Health, NIH, (P30 NS047101, R01 EB02185)","We thank Dr. Shangting You, Jiaao Guan, Henry Hwang, Kathleen Miller, Yi Xiang, Tso-yu Chang, Leilani Kwe for their technical support.

In the present study, we propose a new computational framework to evaluate the mechanical behavior of SLSed CFRP based on the representative volume element (RVE) model. Firstly, a new voxel-based fiber packing algorithm is proposed with the three-dimensional fiber orientation tensor to describe the fiber distribution. The porosity generated in the manufacturing process is also considered by adding spherical voids in the matrix region. In order to remove the artificial stress concentration induced by the voxel-based algorithm, a python script is developed to regenerate the geometries of different phases with conforming mesh. Meanwhile, the constitutive models of different phases in SLSed CFRP, i.e., matrix, fiber and interface, are established according to the material characteristics. Next, the proposed computational framework of SLSed CFRP is validated by the X-ray computed tomography (XCT) measurements and tensile tests of a representative SLSed carbon fiber/polyamide 12 (CF/PA12) composite. The effects of fiber volume fraction and fiber orientation distribution on the mechanical behavior of SLSed CF/PA12 composite are further quantitatively explored and ranked with regards to their influence on stiffness and failure strength. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites; Computational framework; Selective laser sintering; Structure-property relationship; X-ray computed tomography","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Composite structures; Computerized tomography; Fabrication; Fibers; Graphite fibers; Laser heating; Sintering; Tensile testing; Additive manufacturing process; Carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite; Fiber orientation distribution; Material characteristics; Representative volume element (RVE); Selective laser sintering(SLS); Structure property relationships; X-ray computed tomography; Selective laser sintering","","","","","Ford Motor Company; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51975393); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","Funding text 1: A supercomputing grant from HPC System at National University of Singapore acknowledged.

As a consequence, increased attention has to be paid to the mechanical, chemical and physical properties of the printed materials. In mechanical engineering, the widespread use of AM technologies requires the optimization of process parameters and material properties in order to obtain components with high, repeatable and time-stable mechanical properties. One of the main problems in this regard is the anisotropic behavior of components made by additive manufacturing, determined by the type of material, the 3D printing technology, the process parameters and the position of the components in the printing space. In this paper the influence of the printing orientation angle on the tensile behavior of specimens made by material jetting is investigated. The aim was to determine if the positioning of components at different angles relative to the X-axis of the printer (and implicitly in relation to the multijet printing head) contributes to anisotropic behavior. The material used was a photopolymer with a mechanical strength between 40 MPa and 55 MPa, according to the producer. Four sets of tensile test specimens were manufactured, using flat build orientation and positioned on the printing table at angles of 0°, 30°, 60° and 90° to the X-axis of the printer. Comparative analysis of the mechanical behavior was carried out by tensile tests and microscopic investigations of the tensile test specimens fracture surfaces. © 2021 Syscom 18 SRL.

Replicating natural rocks using models produced by three-dimensional printing (3DP) technology is a promising method for visualising and quantifying the hidden structural changes, stress evolution, and fluid flow within subsurface rocks. The development of model materials that are suitable for 3DP and reflect the physical and mechanical properties of rocks is the key to achieving this goal. In this study, the mechanical and optical properties of the printable stress-sensitive photopolymer VeroClear were measured at temperatures in the range from −50 to 125 °C to evaluate the suitability of this photopolymer for modelling actual rocks. The contact angles of the material in different solutions used for evaluating the fluid flow behaviour of rocks were also measured. The reported datasets experimentally support the use of additively printed models for evaluating the solid and fluid mechanics of subsurface rocks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing technology; Mechanical properties; Optical properties; Printable photopolymer; Temperature effects; Wettability","3D printers; Enhanced recovery; Fluid mechanics; Optical properties; Rocks; Complex structure; Hidden structures; Model materials; Natural rocks; Physical and mechanical properties; Stress evolution; Stress sensitive; Three-dimensional printing (3DP); Flow of fluids","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology of China; National Nature Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51674251, 51727807, 51904307); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST, (2016RA4067); Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST","Funding text 1: Funding: This work was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 51727807, 51674251 and 51904307] and the Innovation Teams of the Ten-Thousand Talents Program sponsored by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China [grant number 2016RA4067].; Funding text 2: Funding: This work was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 51727807 , 51674251 and 51904307 ] and the Innovation Teams of the Ten-Thousand Talents Program sponsored by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China [grant number 2016RA4067 ].","Sun K., Tan J., Wu D., The research on dynamic rules of crack extension during hydraulic fracturing for oil shale in-situ exploitation, Procedia Environ.

Herein, the effects of spatial hybrid arrangement patterns on the compression performances of multi-layer lattice structures were investigated in terms of load-bearing capacity and deformation mode. Using four types of lattice unit cells with evident discrepancies in geometric morphologies and mechanical properties, three hybrid arrangements (horizontal, vertical, and circular) composed of any two types of cells were constructed according to natural biology. Several typical lattice core sandwich panels were fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM). The ultimate strengths and compressive moduli were assessed by experiments and finite element analysis. The data were then compared to theoretical simulations predicted by the traditional mixture rule. The results revealed significant effects of spatial arrangement patterns and cell performance differences on the overall mechanical performances, especially in terms of ultimate strength. The traditional mixture rule was found unsuitable for the prediction of hybrid lattice core panels strengths owing to discrepancies in node constrain degree and layer deformation distribution. Layer-by-layer failure behavior was identified as the main mode for the horizontal hybrid panels, whereas shear failure behavior played a dominant mode. Under identical relative density and arrangement patterns, panels contracted with horizontal hybrids were weaker than vertical ones. In sum, these findings look promising for future design of multi-scale lattice structures. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Hybrid effect; Lattice structure; Mechanical properties; Selective laser melting","Biomechanics; Cells; Cytology; Deformation; Light modulators; Mixtures; Morphology; Selective laser melting; Compression performance; Deformation behavior; Load-bearing capacity; Mechanical performance; Selective laser melting (SLM); Spatial arrangements; Theoretical simulation; Topological configuration; Structural design","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11872012); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology, SKLEST; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFB0103801); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development of China ( 2017YFB0103801 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 11872012 ) and the Project of State Key Laboratory of Explosion Science and Technology .","Schaedler T., Jacobsen A., Torrents A., Sorensen A., Lian J., Greer J., Valdevit L., Carter W., Ultralight metallic microlattices, Science, 334, 6058, pp. 962-965, (2011); Campoli G., Borleffs M., Yavari S., Wauthle R., Weinans H., Zadpoor A., Mechanical properties of open-cell metallic biomaterials manufactured using additive manufacturing, Mater.

A parametric and automated 3D model for these structures is created in SolidWorks using the Visual Basic (VBA) programming language. Different configurations of the isogrid LCS structure are modeled, manufactured, and tested in order to determine the compressive structural strength and stiffness, as well as to investigate structural instability. The experimental results are used to deduce the inherent limitations of 3D printing, including the inhomogeneities, imperfections, and non-isotropic nature of FDM, as well as the effect of the configurations on local buckling behavior. The results suggest that coupling between local and global buckling has an impact on the compressive stiffness and strength of LCS structures, reducing the accuracy of structural designs neglecting these effects. © 2021 by the authors.","3D printing; additive manufacturing; cylindrical shell; fused deposition modeling; isogrid; local buckling; polymer structures","","","","","","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (UID/05975/2020); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT; Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior, MCTES","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support provided by the Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) of Portugal, within the scope of the project of the Research Unit on Materials, Energy and Environment for Sustainability (proMetheus), Ref.

Within industry, often the same additive manufacturing machines are used for research and development of components as are used for production. However, there is a challenge in terms of determining how the machine set-up and resulting part quality from one machine translates to another machine. This work determines the effect of varying machines and operators on the resultant part qualities. A build plate with specimens designed for the quantification of key material parameters was designed and manufactured on three different EOS M280 machines at different locations. This research shows the requirement to develop optimised part parameters for each AM machine and also the requirement for the standardisation of powder bed packing, which directly affect the build quality. © 2021, ModTech Publishing House.

This paper aims to achieve a simultaneous optimal solution for build time and surface roughness as the output data and also to find the best values for the input data consisting of build orientation, extrusion width, layer thickness, infill percentage and raster angle. Design/methodology/approach: For this purpose, the effects of process parameters on the response variables were investigated by the design of experiments approach to develop empirical models using response surface methodology. The experimental parts of this research were conducted using an inexpensive and locally assembled fused filament fabrication (FFF) machine. A total of 50 runs for 4 different geometries, namely, cylinder, prism, 3DBenchy and twist gear vase, were performed using the rotatable central composite design, and each process parameters were investigated in two levels to develop empirical models. Also, a novel optimization method, namely, the posterior-based method, was accomplished to find the best values for the response variables. Findings: The results demonstrated that not only the build orientation and layer thickness have notable effects on both response variables but also build time is dependent on extrusion width and infill percentage. Low infill percentage and high extrusion width resulted in increasing build time. By reducing layer thickness and infill percentage while increasing extrusion width, parts of high-quality surface finish and reduced built time were produced. Optimum process parameters were found to be of build direction of 0°, extrusion width of 0.61 mm, layer thickness of 0.22 mm, infill percentage of 20% and raster angle of 0°. Originality/value: Through the developed empirical models and by minimizing build orientation and layer thickness, and also considerations for process parameters, parts of high-quality surface finish and reduced built time could be produced on FFF machines. To compensate for increased build time because of reduction in layer thickness, extrusion width and infill percentage must have their maximum and minimum value, respectively. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Build orientation;

First, the reasons for warpage were theoretically elucidated. This approach revealed that the thermal deformation and differential volumetric shrinkage of the extruded molten plastic resulted in warpage of FDM parts. In addition, low adhesion between the deposited model and the heated or non-heated printing bed may intensify warpage further. As a next step, initial small-size and medium-size models were used to identify parameters to manage and minimize warpage in a way that would reduce material consumption and running time. Finally, a macro-size model was built to experimentally investigate and verify the technical solutions to minimize the warpage of FDM parts. In conclusion, an improved part with reduced warpage was efficiently produced after detailed consideration of thermal effects and adhesion force. Potential exists to widen the application scope of FDM technology in manufacturing for processes like thermoforming that involve mold core fabrication with heating. This technology, which has applications not only in mechanical engineering but also in related engineering fields, is convenient and could readily be applied to practical manufacturing industries. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

The influence on microstructure and fatigue properties was investigated on plain specimens and with a V-notched geometry. Both vacuum heat treatment and HIP had effects on the microstructure and internal defects, which resulted in an enhancement of quasi-static and fatigue properties.

Additionally, an empirical method was presented for the estimation of extrudate deflection in unsupported regions of lattice cells for different geometric configurations. Design/methodology/approach: Metal-polymer feedstock with a solids-loading of 59 Vol.% compounded and extruded into a filament was used for three-dimensional printing of lattice structures. A unit cell was used as a starting point, which was then extended to multi-stacked lattice structures. Feasible MF3 processing conditions were identified to fabricate defect-free lattice structures. The effects of lattice geometry parameters on part deflection and relative density were investigated at the unit cell level. Computational simulations were used to predict the part quality and results were verified by experimental printing. Finally, using the identified processing and geometry parameters, multi-stacked lattice structures were successfully printed and sintered. Findings: Lattice geometry required considerable changes in MF3 printing parameters as compared to printing bulk parts. Lattice cell dimensions showed a considerable effect on dimensional variations and relative density due to varying aspect ratios. The experimental printing of lattice showed large deflection/sagging in unsupported regions due to gravity, whereas simulation was unable to estimate such deflection. Hence, an analytical model was presented to estimate extrudate deflections and verified with experimental results. Lack of diffusion between beads was observed in the bottom facing surface of unsupported geometry of sintered unit cells as an effect of extrudate sagging in the green part stage. This study proves that MF3 can fabricate fully dense Ti-6Al-4V lattice structures that appear to be a promising candidate for applications where mechanical performance, light-weighting and design customization are required.

Various methods of additive manufacturing (AM) from such alloys are being developed. AM is attractive because of its flexibility and its potential to reduce the number of assembly and machining operations. However, the issues of defect and microstruc-ture formation at AM of TiAl alloys have not been sufficiently studied to ensure an industrial application. In the present work, a Cr-and Nb-doped TiAl alloy is obtained by self-propagating high-temperature synthesis under an overload necessary for better separation of slag impurities. Samples of the alloy are processed with a laser beam in the conditions typical of AM by selective laser melting (SLM) in scanning speeds ranging from 5 to 4000 mm/s, laser power from 10 to 165 W, and preheating temperatures from 25°C to 800°C. It is shown that cracking can be avoided in laser processing with preheating up to 800°C in the range of the scanning speed from 10 to 200 mm/s. The formed material microstructure is studied by SEM and related to the cracking ability. A strategy for theoretical assistance in the SLM parameter optimization is proposed based on a model of heat transfer in the laser-interaction zone. This strategy is validated by comparison with the experimental data. It is shown that several experiments are sufficient to predict the integrity of optimal combinations of the following process parameters: laser power, scanning speed, and preheating temperature. © 2021 by Begell House, Inc.","Cooling rate; Laser powder-bed fusion; Preheating; Scanning speed; Selective laser melting; Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis","Aluminum alloys; Chromium alloys; Cracks; Laser beams; Melting; Niobium alloys; Preheating; Selective laser melting; Slags; Titanium alloys; Turbomachine blades; Cooling rates; Laser powder-bed fusion; Laser powders; Laser power; Laser process; Powder bed; Scanning speed; Selective laser melting; Self propagating high temperature synthesis; TiAl alloy; Binary alloys","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (21-19-)","This work was supported by the Russian Science Foundation (Grant Agreement No. 21-19-","Andreev D.E., Yukhvid V.I., Ikornikov D.M., Sanin V.N., Sachkova N.V., Ignat'eva T.I., Kovalev I.D., Autowave Synthesis of TiAl-Based Cast Composite Materials from Thermite-Type Mixtures, Inorg.

Some of these are non-homogeneous particle distribution, setup difficulties, time-consuming and costly. On the other hand, three-dimensional printing technology is a quite popular method. Especially, Stereolithography (SLA) printing offers some benefits such as fast printing, easy setup and smooth surface specialties. Furthermore, surface modification of Graphene Oxide (GO) and its effects on polymer nanocomposites are quite important. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of surface modification of GO nanoparticles on the mechanical properties and morphology of epoxy acrylate (BisGMA/1,6 hexane diol diacrylate) matrix nanocomposites. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, Ultraviolet (UV) curable end groups of synthesized resin were linked to functional groups of graphene oxide, which are synthesized by the Tour method, which is a kind of modified Hummer method. In addition, synthesized GO nanoparticle’s surfaces were modified by 3-(methacryloyloxy) propyl trimethoxysilane. Significant weight percentages of GO were added into the epoxy acrylate resin. Different Wt.% of modified graphene oxide/acrylate resins was used to print test specimens with SLA type three-dimensional printer. Findings: Surface modification has a significant effect on tensile strength for graphene oxide nanoparticles contained composites. In addition, a specific trend was not observed for tensile test results of non-modified graphene oxide. The tendency of impact and hardness test finding were similar for both surfaces modified and non-modified nanoparticles. Finally, the distribution of particles was homogeneous. Originality/value: This paper is unique because of the inclusion of both surface modifications of graphene oxide nanoparticles and SLA production of nanocomposites with its own production of three-dimensional printer and photocurable polymer resin. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Graphene nanocomposite;

This technology represents the near realization of the machine-based ideal attained by technologizing biological systems. The deployment of bioprinting establishes a powerful sociotechnical imaginary associated with this technology giving rise to a particular conception of the future. Interviews conducted with researchers working in a French start-up specialized on printing human skin revealed two types of futures built into the bioprinting imaginary: the indeterminate and uncertain future of tissues and organs for regenerative and personalized medicine; and the more achievable and profitable future of in vitro tissue models used by the pharmaceutical industry for drug screening. As part of this temporal landscape, bioprinting researchers struggle with issues such as the imperatives of the innovation model, technical challenges, media hype and their personal expectations. The concrete materialization of the bioprinting sociotechnical imaginary presents itself when researchers are directly confronted with the expectations of patients in search of treatments. These encounters provide an opportunity for researchers to reflect upon the ambiguous nature of their participation in the promissory economy and the construction of projected futures within the bioprinting imaginary. © 2021 Process Press.","Bioprinting; future; hype; promissory; sociotechnical imaginary","","","","","","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC, (00937); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","This study was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (00937).

Minimising voids and improving filament-to-filament adhesion remains a key technological challenge for FFF. While mechanical rolling is commonly used in traditional manufacturing, its use in polymer 3D printing has not been explored much. This paper discusses the in situ compression of just-deposited filament using a roller that is integrated with the filament-dispensing nozzle. The roller travels with the filament nozzle, and compresses the filament immediately after deposition when it is still soft. The rolling process is characterised using high speed imaging and infrared (IR) thermography. The effects of compression force and roller temperature on print quality is investigated. In situ compression of the filaments is shown to result in 10X reduction in void formation. Tensile test results show 154% improvement in Ultimate Tensile Stress (UTS) and 417% improvement in material toughness due to compressive rolling.

During the experimental work were tested a total of 15 ""dog bone"" ASTM D638-14 standard specimens made from additively manufactured polymer (PLA) through FDM (Fused Deposition Modelling) technique, where the material and rectilinear pattern infill geometry and infill percentage of 100% were constant and the printing orientation was varied. Usually technical data sheets that are delivered by filament materials producers include the most satisfactory data which are valid for only one specific printing direction. The printing direction is deliberately selected, in such way that the best material characteristics are achieved. In addition to this matter, as the additive manufacturing market grew significantly in the past couple of years, the filament production market showed a consequential growth. The aftermath of this expansion had a direct impact towards the quality and costs of the filaments used for 3D printing, in order to satisfy both the low-end and high-end users. Therefore, in this frame, the present research provides entry-level additively manufactured PLA performances showing significant changes depending on the different printing directions and determine the build orientation influence on the mechanical properties, in the aim of providing aid for both mechanical designer and product manufacturer at the stage of the printed product mechanical properties. © 2021 Syscom 18 SRL.

The effect of processing parameters of FDM on the porosity and compressive strength of PEEK scaffold with uniform pores (0.8 mm of diameter) was optimized through Taguchi methodology. With the determined parameters, four kinds of PEEK scaffolds with gradient pores (0.4–0.8 mm, 0.6–1.0 mm, 0.8–1.2 mm, and 1.2–2.0 mm) were manufactured. The scaffolds were investigated using scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that the pores of scaffolds were interconnected with rough surface, which can allow the attachment, migration, and differentiation of cells for bone forming. The tensile strength, compressive max strength, and compressive yield strength of scaffolds were between 18 and 35 MPa, 197.83 and 370.42 MPa, and 26 and 36 MPa, respectively. The mechanical properties of the scaffolds can satisfy the loading requirements of human bones. Therefore, the PEEK scaffolds have a potential to be used in tissue engineering as implants. © 2021 De Gruyter.

However, inert gas trapped in the pores could cause healed pores to re-grow after elevated temperature exposure. Therefore, understanding the possible effects of this pore re-opening phenomenon is crucial in maintaining quality of parts subjected to elevated temperatures during service. The aim of the present study was to investigate pore re-opening after HIP in Ti–6Al–4V parts by exposing samples to different elevated temperatures for varying times. The changes in the pore content were studied using microscopy and micro X-ray computed tomography in combination with gas content analysis. Based on the results, it was concluded that for typical service temperatures of Ti–6Al–4V, pore re-opening was minimal. © 2021 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining Published by Taylor & Francis on behalf of the Institute.","Additive manufacturing; HIP; Hot Isostatic Pressing; laser powder bed fusion; pore; porosity; Ti–6Al–4V; µ-CT","3D printers; Computerized tomography; Hot isostatic pressing; Inert gases; Titanium compounds; Elevated temperature; Elevated temperature exposures; Gas content; Laser powders; Micro-x-ray; Pore content; Service temperature; Aluminum compounds","","","","","Quintus Technologies AB; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (820774)","This work was supported by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme research an innovation programme under grant number 820774.

This article overviews two types of SLM-fabricated Ti alloys exhibiting excellent strength and ductility. First, fully martensitic Ti-6Al-4 V alloys are produced with high yield strengths of >1100 MPa and total elongations of ~12–14%, comparable to those in fine α/β lamellar Ti-6Al-4 V. Second, hybridisation of different microstructures from existing alloys to generate a ‘composite of microstructures’ is introduced as a new strategy for producing heterogenous alloys with significantly enhanced performances. In particular, Ti alloys hybridised from different classes of Ti (α, α-β and β) have exhibited an excellent combination of high strength, work hardening ability and ductility, superior to conventional pure Ti andTi alloys. © 2021 Engineers Australia.","heterogeneous microstructures;

However, despite the many advantages of SLS compared to fusion deposition modelling, there are still today some limitations on the materials to be printed. A limit critical from an industrial point of view is the aging of PA12 powder, i.e. the degradation of its physical and chemical performances, due to the high temperatures and the long printing cycles, thus involving a decrease of the mechanical properties of the printed parts. The purpose of this study was to charaterize mechanically and dimensionally specimens printed in PA12 through SLS by means of virgin or aged powder, i.e. powder just used for five printing cycles. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this aim, a set of specimens were designed, built, measured and mechanically tested; the obtained results were put into relationship with the values of the process parameters used to print them. Statistical tools to design the experiments and to analyse the obtained results were used. Findings: The results show that the SLS process carried out through a Sintratec machine on PA12 powder has a good repeatability. To obtain the best dimensional and mechanical performances, it is needed to use virgin powder and place the part in the central zone of the printing area. Originality/value: There are no scientific articles dealing with the influence of both the aging of the powder and the manufacturing parameters on the dimensional and mechanical characterization of specimens printed with SLS technique in PA12. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive layer manufacturing; Aging; Dimensional accuracy; Mechanical performances; PA12; Selective laser sintering","Laser heating; Sintering; Statistical mechanics; Chemical performance; Design/methodology/approach; Dimensional accuracy; Manufacturing parameters; Mechanical characterizations; Mechanical performance; Scientific articles; Selective laser sintering(SLS); Selective laser sintering","","","","","Ministry of Instructions, University and Technological Research","This work was carried out with the funding of Italian M.I.U.R.

Specifically, milling technology is involved very often, which can be supplemented by finishing operations. Besides standard ball-nose end mills, circle segment end mills are modern type of cutter that has begun to be used with the development of advanced computer aided machining software, that allows to work with these shaped tools. In this research, comparing the performance of these two modern shaped end mills was investigated. One tool was a commercially available coated solid carbide circle segment end mill. A second prototype end mill with the same profile but different geometry was made with a PCD insert, that additionally had a chipbreaker produced by laser technology. Machining was carried out on the workpiece material the Ti-6Al-4V that was manufactured by additive manufacturing (AM) technology - selective laser melting (SLM). The titanium complex parts are generally used in the transport industries and medicine. Milling tests were performed under dry cutting conditions. The evaluation was based on the force load, the roughness of the machined surface and tool wear. The higher total forces were measured by the tool with a PCD insert, because a different tool geometry was used, despite the use of integral chipbreaker, which allows a partial change of the cutting geometry of the insert. The geometry of end mills with brazed insert is limited by the production process. © 2021, MM publishing Ltd..

It was motivated by the objective of understanding additive manufacturing processes such as Laser Powder Bed Fusion. A fundamental aspect of the relationship between manufacturing, structure, and properties is the correlation of rapid solidification and resulting microstructure. During powder-based additive manufacturing processes, cooling rates up to 1 MK/s are attained. A thermal analysis determining the characteristics of solidification at such rapid cooling rates can be performed with the aid of chip sensor-based, dynamic Differential Fast Scanning Calorimetry, DFSC. For this purpose, the heat flow during the solidification of single powder particles is measured and, for instance, the solidification onset temperature is evaluated as a function of cooling rate. It is thus possible to estimate the undercooling which has a significant impact on the resulting structure. Subsequently, cross sections of single powder particles must be prepared for the analysis of the resulting structure. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston, Germany","AlSi10Mg; Aluminum alloy; AlZn5.5MgCu; Preparation; Single particle; Solidification","3D printers; Additives; Rapid solidification; Thermoanalysis; Undercooling; Additive manufacturing process; Alzn5.5mgcu; Cooling rates; Laser powders; Powder bed; Powder particles; Preparation; Single-particle; Structures and properties; Systematic method; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Deutsche Forschun-gsgemeinschaft; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (KE616/27–1, KE616/29–1, YA417/4–1, ZH661/3–1)","The authors would like to thank the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschun-gsgemeinschaft) for their funding of the work as part of the priority program 2122 “Materials for Additive Manufacturing” (projects KE616/27–1 and ZH661/3–1) as well as part of of the project “In-situ differential fast scanning calorimetry of rapid solidification of aluminum-based alloys” (KE616/29–1 and YA417/4–1).","Murphy T.F., International Journal of Powder Metallurgy, 52, 1, pp. 25-35; Chasoglou D., Praktische Metallographie/Practical Metallography, 50, 12, pp. 799-809, (2013); Wimler D., Kardos S., Lindemann J., Clemens H., Mayer S., Praktische Metallographie/Practical Metallography, 55, 9, pp. 620-636, (2018); Gebhardt A., Additive Fertigungsverfahren, (2016); Li Y., Gu D., Mater Des, 63, pp. 856-867, (2014); Doubenskaia M.A., Zhirnov I.V., Teleshevskiy V.I., Bertrand P., Smurov I.Y., Determination of True Temperature in Selective Laser Melting of Metal Powder Using Infrared Camera, (2015); Zhuravlev E., Schick C., Thermochim Acta, 50, 1-2, pp. 1-13, (2010); Gao Y.L., Zhuravlev E., Zou C.D., Yang B., Zhai Q.J., Schick C., Thermochim Acta, 482, pp. 1-7, (2008); Gao Y., Zhao B., Yang B., Schick C., Fast scanning calorimetry of phase transitions in metals, Fast Scanning Calorimetry, pp. 691-721, (2016); Zhao B., Li L., Lu F., Zhai Q., Yang B., Schick C., Gao Y., Thermochim Acta, 603, pp. 2-23, (2015); Weck E., Leistner E., Metallographische Anleitung Zum Farbätzen Nach Dem Tauchverfahren Teil III, (1986); Zheng B., Lin Y., Zhou Y., Lavernia E., Metallurgical and Materials Transactions B, 40, pp. 768-778, (2009); Pengjun F., Yi X., Xinggang L., Ya C., Rare Metal Materials and Engineering, 47, 2, pp. 423-430, (2018); Mullis A., Farrell L., Cochrane R., Adkins N., Metallurgical and Materials Transactions B, 44, (2013)","B.

In addition, bio composite materials contribute to the sustainable ecosystem with their ease of recyclability. The effect of accelerated aging on the mechanical properties of PLA matrix biocomposite specimens has been observed in previous research. However, the effect of accelerated aging on the mechanical properties and the resulting mass loss of the material produced with fused filament fabrication (FFF) has been discussed for the first time in this study. Aging was applied to the biocomposite consisted of 10% hemp and PLA matrix produced at a constant rate, parallel to the tensile direction and cross (+/– 45°) angle, and the tensile stress and mass loss were examined. The aging effect has been observed even from the first week. Specimens with parallel printing to tensile direction showed a lower tensile performance than cross printing one. Since the structure in the laminates is quite durable, the adhesion performance in the laminate or through thickness direction has been low. Natural fibers are found so highly hygroscopic that chemical treatments will improve the interface and improve the mechanical properties. © 2021 King Mongkut’s University of Technology North Bangkok.

Although the state-of-art ceramic honeycomb substrate designs provide high surface area and a degree of flexibility for heat and mass transfer adaptations, additional emission reduction benefits can be achieved when more flexible designs to provide effective thermal management are introduced. The conventional cordierite honeycomb substrates are manufactured by extrusion; therefore, only substrates with straight channels can be fabricated. This study aims to highlight any design limitations of conventional substrates by employing additive manufacturing as the main method of manufacturing diamond lattice structures using DLP (digital light processing) technology. Both conventional substrates and diamond lattice structures are studied numerically and experimentally for flow through resistance and temperature distribution. Numerical predictions and experimental results showed good agreement. The results show the increase of the axial temperature distribution for diamond lattice structures and a significant decrease of the pressure drop (38–45%) in comparison with the benchmark honeycomb with similar surface area. © 2020, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; Ceramic substrate; CFD; Honeycomb; Monolith","3D printers; Additives; Ceramics industry; Crystal lattices; Diamonds; Emission control; Gas emissions; Honeycomb structures; Mass transfer; Silicate minerals; Temperature distribution; Cordierite honeycomb; Degree of flexibility; Diamond lattice structure; Digital light processing; Experimental testing; Heat and mass transfer; Hydraulic properties; Numerical predictions; Substrates","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/P031226/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; University of Birmingham","The research leading to these results has received funding from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council for project FACE - Novel Integrated Fuel Reformer-Aftertreatment System for Clean and Efficient Road Vehicles under grant number EP/P031226/1.

The main steps of the component design will be presented, specially the methods and parameters applied to the topology optimization and the post-smoothing process. The SIMP method was applied in order to obtain a lighter component and a suitable stiffness for the desired application. In addition, since residual stresses are intrinsic to every metallic additive manufacturing process, the influence of those stresses will be also analysed. The Laser Powder Bed Fusion was numerically simulated aiming at evaluating the residual stresses the workpiece during the manufacturing process and to investigate how they could influence the fatigue behaviour of the optimized component. The effect of the built orientation of the workpiece on the residual stresses at some selected potential critical points are evaluated. The final design solution presented a stiffness/volume ratio nearly 6 times higher when compared to the initial geometry. By choosing the built orientation, it is possible impact favourably in the fatigue life of the component. © 2021, Gruppo Italiano Frattura.

The results clarify that the influence sequence of individual parameter on the porosity is laser power > hatch spacing > layer thickness > scan speed. Ultrasonic fatigue tests (20 kHz) were conducted for the SLMed specimens in high-cycle fatigue (HCF) and very-high-cycle fatigue (VHCF) regimes. The S-N data show that the fatigue strength is greatly affected by the porosity: the group with the smallest porosity percentage having the highest fatigue strength in HCF and VHCF regimes. Then, the tests on the validation group were performed to verify the optimal combination of SLM processing parameters. Moreover, the observations by scanning electron microscopy revealed that fatigue cracks initiate at lack-of-fusion defects in the cases of surface and internal crack initiation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","orthogonal experiment design; processing parameters; selective laser melting; Ti-6Al-4V; very-high-cycle fatigue","Aluminum alloys; Aluminum metallography; Cracks; Fatigue testing; Hatches; Melting; Porosity; Scanning electron microscopy; Selective laser melting; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Titanium metallography; Ultrasonic testing; High cycle fatigue; Optimal combination; Orthogonal experiment design; Processing parameters; Selective laser melting (SLM); Surface and internal cracks; Ultrasonic fatigue tests; Very high cycle fatigue; Fatigue of materials","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11932020); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (XDB22020201, XDB22040503); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Financial supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (11932020) and from the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB22040503 and XDB22020201) are greatly acknowledged.

Microstructural characterization, nanoindentation creep tests as well as tensile experiments were also performed on the achieved specimens to evaluate the effect brought by the various heat treatment routines. It is found that DCT treatment produces a finer microstructure with higher quantity of homogenous tiny precipitates, compared with the as-printed SLM and single IA counterparts. Such microstructure of the DCT specimen leads to a desirable indentation creep resistance at room temperature as well as a good mechanical performance on tension. In addition, applying a prior deep cryogenic treatment before the intercritical annealing brings more positive effects on the mechanical properties than only using IA. The result indicates that the DCT routine is definitely considerably beneficial for fabricating reliable metallic products fabricated by selective laser melting, and it provides an efficient alternative in real manufactures as well. © 2020, ASM International.","deep cryogenic; fracture; intercritical annealing; microstructure; nanohardness; nanoindentation creep; selective laser melting; steel","Austenitic stainless steel; Creep; Creep resistance; Cryogenics; Heat treatment; Melting; Microstructure; Austenite stainless steel; Deep cryogenic treatment; Effect of heat treatments; Intercritical annealing; Mechanical performance; Micro-structural characterization; Nanoindentation creeps; Selective laser melting (SLM); Selective laser melting","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2019JJ60062)","This work was finance d by the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan province (Grant No. 2019JJ60062).

In particular, the mechanical performance of the fabricated specimens was determined by conducting compression and cyclic compression testing, as well as nanoindentation tests. In addition, the design and the manufacturing of hierarchical honeycomb structures are presented using the materials under study. The 3D printed honeycomb structures were examined by uniaxial compressive tests to review the mechanical behavior of such cellular structures. The compressive performance of the hierarchical honeycomb structures was also evaluated with finite element analysis (FEA) in order to extract the stress-strain response of these structures. The results revealed that the 2nd order hierarchy displayed increased stiffness and strength as compared with the 0th and the 1st hierarchies. Furthermore, the addition of carbon fibers in the ABS matrix improved the stiffness, the strength and the hardness of the FFF printed specimens as well as the compression performance of the honeycomb structures. © 2021 by the authors.

This technique has been extensively employed in manufacturing Ti-6Al-4V parts for aerospace and biomedical applications. However, many challenges, including poor surface quality, porosity, anisotropy in microstructure and property, and difficulty in tailoring microstructure, still exist. In this paper, we review the recent progress in post-process treatment and its influence on the microstructure evolution and material performance, including tensile, fatigue, fracture toughness, creep, and corrosion properties. The contradictions in simultaneously achieving high strength/ductility and strength/fracture toughness/creep resistance have been identified. Furthermore, research gaps in understanding the effects of the emerging bi-modal microstructure on fatigue properties and fracture toughness require further investigation. © The Author(s) 2021.","","","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (IH130100008); Australian Research Council, ARC; University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, USST","This work is funded by Australian Research Council IH130100008 “Industrial Transformation Research Hub for Transforming Australia's Manufacturing Industry through High Value Additive Manufacturing ”.

Reliable and effective monitoring strategies for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) therefore remain in high demand and are the subject of current research. To address this demand, a novel analysis approach using high dynamic range (HDR) optical imaging in combination with convolutional neural networks (CNN) is proposed for spatially resolved and layer-wise prediction of the surface roughness of LPBF parts. In a further step, the predicted surface roughness maps are used as a feedback signal for a reinforcement learning technique that employs a dynamics model to subsequently identify optimal process parameters under varying and uncertain conditions. The proposed approach ultimately combines the estimation of the local surface roughness based on image texture and model-based reinforcement learning to an in-situ optimization framework for LPBF processes. In addition, the relationship between the layer surface roughness of the part and the overall part density is discussed on the basis of experimental data, which also indicate the applicability of the proposed method in industrial environments. This preliminary study is a first step towards highly adaptive and intelligent machines in the field of automated laser powder bed fusion with the primary goals of reducing production costs and improving the environmental fingerprint as well as print quality.  © 2013 IEEE.","convolutional neural networks; high dynamic range imaging; Laser powder bed fusion; model-based reinforcement learning; surface roughness optimization","3D printers; Convolutional neural networks; Image texture; Learning systems; Multilayer neural networks; Patient monitoring; Powder metals; Reinforcement learning; Textures; Uncertainty analysis; High dynamic range imaging; Industrial environments; Laser-based additive manufacturing; Model-based reinforcement learning; Optimization framework; Reinforcement learning techniques; Surface roughness maps; Uncertain condition; Surface roughness","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (825030)","This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 825030. https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/grants/grant-management/acknowledge-funding_en.htm.","Yap C.Y., Chua C.K., Dong Z.L., Liu Z.H., Zhang D.Q., Loh L.E., Sing S.L., Review of selective laser melting: Materials and applications, Appl.

This paper evaluates how increasing the powder layer thickness from 20 µm to 80 µm affects the build speed, microstructure and mechanical properties of stainless steel 316L parts that are produced using laser powder bed fusion. A detailed microstructure characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, and x-ray powder diffraction in conjunction with tensile testing. The results suggest that parts can be fabricated four times faster with tensile strengths comparable to those obtained using standard process parameters. In either case, nominal relative density of > 99.9% is obtained but with the 80 µm layer thickness presenting some lack of fusion defects, which resulted in a reduced elongation to fracture. Still, acceptable yield strength and ultimate tensile strength values of 464 MPa and 605 MPa were obtained, and the average elongation to fracture was 44%, indicating that desirable properties can be achieved. © 2020, The Author(s).","additive manufacturing; EBSD; laser powder bed fusion; productivity; stainless steel; tensile properties","3D printers; Diffraction; Microstructure; Productivity; Scanning electron microscopy; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; X ray powder diffraction; Conventional manufacturing; Electron back scatter diffraction; Elongation to fracture; Microstructure and mechanical properties; Microstructure characterization; Process parameters; Stainless steel 316L; Ultimate tensile strength; Austenitic stainless steel","","","","","Swedish Governmental Agency; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (820774); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020","This work was conducted in the framework of the Centre for Additive Manufacturing – Metal (CAM) and AMLIGHT project within the Innovation program Metallic Materials, both supported by Swedish Governmental Agency of Innovation Systems (Vinnova).

Though there are currently several manufacturers of PLA for fused filament fabrication (FFF) platforms, Ingeo grade 4043D (NatureWorks, LLC, Minnetonka, MN, USA) is widely used amongst the 3D printing community. The work presented here compares two grades of commercially available PLA that have been marketed to the 3D printing community. Here, the former ‘gold standard’, PLA Grade 4043D, is compared to the newer grade, 3D870. Mechanical properties, rheological characteristics, chemical qualities, and the ability to manipulate the crystallinity of the material were compared between the two. A detailed fracture surface analysis of tensile specimens was also performed that revealed distinct differences in crack propagation behaviour between the two materials in the annealed and non-annealed conditions. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","annealing;

We observe a hierarchical microstructure spanning over different length scales, consisting of remelted zones and track core regions at the macro-scale, regions with elongated columnar grains and equiaxed grains at the micro-scale, martensitic laths at the submicron-scale, and a high density of dislocations and stacking faults at the nano- and atomic scale. The hierarchical microstructure leads to the outstanding tensile properties of the as-prepared SLM and SLM annealed samples (with yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and fracture strain of ~ 735 MPa, ~ 1211 MPa and ~ 12.8%, and ~ 893 MPa, ~ 1214 MPa and ~ 13.8%, respectively). The mechanisms determining the strength and ductility are discussed in terms of the hierarchical microstructure and internal defects. The cellular structure with a high density of dislocations along their boundaries and the martensitic structure are the reasons for strengthening, while the hierarchical microstructure helps to obtain appropriate ductility. Furthermore, martensitic transformation induced plastic bending of the residual FCC plates was confirmed, which is helpful to maintain the different plastic strain between the heterogeneous structure. The development of the martensitic structure in this Co–Cr–Mo alloy by SLM and its characteristic hierarchical microstructure are promising features for material design and application of high-strength materials with improved strength‒ductility tradeoff. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Athermal ε-martensite; Cobalt–chromium–molybdenum alloy; Hierarchical microstructure; Selective laser melting; Strength","Defects; Ductility; Economic and social effects; High strength alloys; Martensite; Molybdenum alloys; Selective laser melting; Tensile strength; Textures; Density of dislocation; Heterogeneous structures; Hierarchical microstructures; High-strength materials; Martensitic structures; Selective laser melting (SLM); Strength and ductilities; Ultimate tensile strength; Martensitic transformations","","","","","European Commission, EC; Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (340025, 695487); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka, (К2-2020-020); Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka; European Research Council, ERC, (3.7383.2017/8.9); European Research Council, ERC; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (MOBERC15); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF; Guangzhou Science and Technology Program key projects, (201804010365); Guangzhou Science and Technology Program key projects; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51701075); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51701075 ), the Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou (Grant No. 201804010365 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities .

The 1 M HNO3 solution was used to investigate the corrosion behavior of SLM-prepared and T6 heat-treated samples. The results showed that the Si is rejected from supersaturated α-Al matrix to form Si particles during T6 heat treatment and, at the same time, the Si-rich cellular boundaries of SLM-prepared samples are transformed into Si particles. The Mg2Si particles are also formed after T6 heat-treatment. The size of Si/Mg2Si particles increases with increasing the solution-treated temperature. The wear and corrosion resistance of as-built samples are significantly lowered by T6 heat treatment and, they decrease with increasing the solution-treated temperature. The SLM-prepared sample exhibits a selective corrosion attack at the border of the melt pools, whereas the T6 heat-treated sample shows a pitting corrosion. The depth and size of pits increases with increasing the solution temperature. Moreover, the size of pits is nonuniform due to the uneven distributed size of Si particles. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Aluminum alloy; Corrosion; Heat treatment; Microstructure; Selective laser melting; Tribological property","Corrosion resistance; Corrosive effects; Dealloying; Heat resistance; Heat treatment; Magnesium compounds; Melting; Pitting; Selective laser melting; Tribology; Wear of materials; Wear resistance; Corrosion behavior; Corrosion property; Selective corrosion; Selective laser melting (SLM); Solution temperature; T6 heat treatment; Treated temperatures; Wear and corrosion resistance; Silicon","","","","","first China special assistant Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (3115200190); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2018M643628, 2019M663682)","The research is supported by the 64th China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant number 2018M643628 ) and the 66th China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant number 2019M663682 ) and first China special assistant Postdoctoral Science Foundation ( 3115200190 ).","Olakanmi E.O., Cochrane R.F., Dalgarno K.W., A review on selective laser sintering/melting (SLS/SLM) of aluminium alloy powders: processing, microstructure, and properties, Prog.

Heat treatments could affect the mechanical properties of 316L stainless steel parts formed by selective laser melting (SLM), which is vital for ensuring service safety. This study aimed to analyze the mechanical behavior of SLM 316L stainless steel under different heat treatment methods. Therefore, test specimens were prepared using the SLM technique and then annealed at 400°C for 1 h. The solution was treated at 1050°C for 20 min. The dynamic compressive mechanical properties of the deposited, annealed, and solution-treated specimens were tested at high strain rates by using a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) experimental apparatus. Moreover, the microstructures of the previously mentioned samples were analyzed by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The experimental results showed that the three-state samples exhibited strain rate sensitivity in the dynamic mechanical tests and that solution treatment could alter their mechanical properties significantly. In addition, the microstructure of the deposited specimens presented cylindrical cellular crystal features, which have a higher dislocation density. Hence, the yield strength of deposited specimens is higher than that of the solution-treated ones. After annealing, the microstructures of the samples did not change obviously, and their dynamic yield strength remained almost unchanged. After solution treatment, its cellular crystal disappeared and dislocation density dropped dramatically, resulting in a sharp decrease in yield strength. Finally, this research can provide a theoretical reference for broadening the practical application of SLM 316L material parts.  © 2021 Jingfa Lei et al.","","Annealing; Austenitic stainless steel; Dynamics;

The process parameters applied in the SLM process determine the cracking severity in these alloys. The purpose of this study is to understand the correlation between the process and the solidification cracking during SLM of Al–Cu alloys. A model based on the modified Rosenthal's equation and Feurer's criterion was developed to predict the critical scanning velocity for the crack initiation during SLM. The calculated result shows that the molten pool center is the most susceptible to the crack initiation in the conductive molten pool, and the susceptibility increases as the distance from the observed point to the molten pool center increases. The overlapping of the molten pool can remelt the previous track, and thus the crack initiating during the previous scanning may be eliminated after the remelting. Therefore, a small hatch spacing is beneficial for manufacturing the crack-free components. The cracking is mainly affected by the mushy zone length and the cooling rate during the process. Hence, the composition strongly affects the cracking. Not only the solidification temperature range but also other thermo-physical properties affect cracking. The model was verified by two different Al–Cu alloys. The cracking initiation and the crack length were observed and measured to evaluate the applicability of the model. The experimental data and the calculation results agree well. The model can be used for the process control as well as the alloy development for SLM of Al–Cu alloys. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Aluminum alloys; Cracking criterion; Selective laser melting; Solidification cracking","Copper alloys; Crack initiation; High strength alloys; Melting; Selective laser melting; Solidification; Calculation results; Cracking severity; High strength aluminum alloys; Process parameters; Selective laser melting (SLM); Solidification cracking; Solidification temperature; Thermo-physical property; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Analytical and Testing Center of HUST; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51805184); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51805184).

However, highly personalized product designs (e.g., geometries) in CAMNet limit the sample size for each design, which may lead to unsatisfactory accuracy for computation services, e.g., a low prediction accuracy for quality modeling. Motivated by the modeling challenge, we proposed a data-driven model called family learning to jointly model similar-but-non-identical products as family members by quantifying the shared information among these products in the CAMNet. Specifically, the amount of shared information for each product is estimated by optimizing a similarity generation model based on design factors, which directly improve the prediction accuracy for the family learning model. The advantages of the proposed method are illustrated by both simulations and a real case study of the selective laser melting process. This family learning method can be broadly applied to data-driven modeling in a network with similar-but-non-identical connected systems. © Copyright © 2021 “IISE”.","Cyber-manufacturing system; quality modeling;

Specimens in accordance with ASTM Standards were printed by varying the process parameters such as layer thickness, infill density and build orientation. Time required to manufacture the part and amount of material consumed during the process are recorded. Increase in infill density results into increase in material consumption and manufacturing time. Layer thickness and build orientation also impacts manufacturing time and material consumption respectively. With increased application of FDM process, determining the process parameter to decrease the material consumption and manufacturing time shall help the FDM practitioners globally.

Total 36 specimens were fabricated under the range from 1.3 to 46.7 J/mm3. The process conditions to achieve over 99.5% ± 0.1% relative planar density were obtained, and the mechanism of tunable mechanical properties was investigated by understanding the correlation between the microstructure and chemical composition according to the energy density. As the energy density increased, tensile properties were decreased with grain growth and the concentrations of light elements were increased by accelerating dissolution. As the concentrations of light elements increased, the mechanism of destructive behavior changed from ductile fracture to brittle fracture and it caused that the hardness was improved. Consequently, it was necessary to control the energy density from 9.34 to 23.98 J/mm3 in order to fabricate SUS316L parts of high strength and high elongation characteristics by SLM method. © 2020 The Authors","Energy density; High density; Property tuning; Selective laser melting; SUS316L","Chemical elements; Density (specific gravity); Ductile fracture; Grain growth; Light modulators; Melting; Chemical compositions; Laser energy density; Micro-structural; Micro-structural properties; Process condition; Process parameters; Selective laser melting (SLM); Stainless steel 316; Selective laser melting","","","","","","","Huang R., Et al., Energy and emissions saving potential of additive manufacturing: the case of lightweight aircraft components, J.

Considering the multi-track multi-layer nature of an actual SLM process, an investigation of thermal behavior and melt pool morphology in multi-track multi-layer SLM of the 316L steel is presented in this paper. The SLM process of a four-layer component with multiple tracks was modeled. Element birth and death technique was used to simulate the layer built-up process. The established FEM model was used to investigate the variations in thermal variables and melt pool morphology with increasing number of layers. Moreover, the influence of various processing parameters in a multi-track multi-layer SLM was also studied. The results show that maximum melt pool temperature, melt pool width, and melt pool depth increase with increasing number of layers, whereas heating rates and cooling rates decrease with increasing number of layers. Compared with the previous layer, melt pool lifetime was observed to have a decreasing trend for layer 2 and increasing trend for layers 3 and 4. An increase in melt pool depth and decrease in melt pool width was observed by increasing hatch spacing. Furthermore, it was found that increasing laser power and scanning speeds both increase the heating and cooling rates. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","FEM; Melt pool; Melt pool morphology; SLM; Thermal behavior","Austenitic stainless steel; Cooling; High power lasers; Lakes; Melting; Morphology; Heating and cooling rates; Melt pool temperature; Melting and solidification; Numerical investigations; Processing parameters; Selective laser melting (SLM); Thermal behaviors; Thermal variables; Selective laser melting","","","","","Key Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong, (201902005, 2019GGX104006, 2019GGX104008); Key Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51905306, 51975335); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Taishan Scholar Project of Shandong Province, (ts20190975); Taishan Scholar Project of Shandong Province","The authors receive financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, Grant Nos.: 51905306 and 51975335), the Key Research and Development Program of Shandong Province (Grant Nos.: 2019GGX104008 and 2019GGX104006), Special Support for Post-doc Creative Funding of Shandong Province (201902005), and the Taishan Scholars Project of Shandong Province of China (No. ts20190975).

AM-fabricated NiTi parts may contain micropore/voids and have a rough surface due to the nature of the fabrication. As a solution, we proposed a modification to the NiTi-selective laser melting/SLM approach that could possibly reduce the internal micropores/voids and improve the relative density and surface roughness of the parts. In this approach, here referred to as remelting, the laser rescans each layer followed by the main laser scan and prior to the powder deposition for the next layer. To this end, we fabricated AM NiTi coupons with combinations of power and scanning speed with the same hatch spacing for evaluating the effect of remelting. SEM analysis, density and surface roughness measurements, and X-ray CT, as well as DSC and compression tests were utilized for characterization. It was revealed that the remelting procedure in each layer homogenizes the surface, reduces the defects, and improves the powder bed quality of the next layer. It was found that using proper combinations of remelting process parameters, it is possible to fabricate NiTi components with increased density, fewer defects, and smoother top surfaces, which are important factors in fatigue life and functionality of the parts. Although the transformation temperatures and compression response were not significantly affected by the remelting procedure, the process is expected to improve the fatigue life of the SLM NiTi samples, which will be investigated in the future studies. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Additive manufacturing; NiTi; Remelting; Selective laser melting; Shape memory alloys","Additives; Binary alloys; Compression testing; Computerized tomography; Fabrication; Fatigue of materials; Microporosity; Nickel metallography; Remelting; Selective laser melting; Shape-memory alloy; Surface roughness; Titanium alloys; Powder deposition; Process parameters; Relative density; Rough surfaces; Scanning speed; SEM analysis; Top surface; Transformation temperatures; Titanium metallography","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1916364); National Science Foundation, NSF","This research was partly funded by the National Science Foundation award #1916364 and Ohio Federal Network.

However, post-processing is usually unavoidable for these components to achieve functional performance. To obtain an optimum product, knowledge of the characteristics of the additive manufactured part and the machining mechanisms depending on these characteristics is required. In this paper, the influence and the interaction of the laser powder bed fusion process parameters on the subtractive post-processing are shown. The effects of the parameters on the geometry of bores are examined and subsequently the precision machinability is analysed using reaming. In addition, a process simulation is carried out to correlate the simulated deformation to the required machining allowance for subsequent reaming. The aim of this investigation is to examine the capabilities of the laser powder bed fusion process to produce bores at angles of 90° (vertical), 60° and 45° that can be machined directly with a reaming tool without the need for drilling. © 2021, Editorial Institution of Wrocaw Board of Scientific.

A finite element (FE) model of the PBF-LB process is developed for prediction of thermal history and spatial distributions of temperature. Based on the relationships between FE predicted thermal history, thermal gradient and key manufacturing parameters such as laser power and scanning speed, an additive manufacturing (AM) process map for different solidification morphologies, including columnar-to-equiaxed transition, is developed. Phase transformation kinetics for the non-isothermal steps is adopted and implemented within a stand-alone code based on the FE predicted thermal histories of sample material points. The method is successfully validated by comparison with published experimental data and the developed process-structure model can be potentially used as a process design tool to efficiently produce tailored and optimized microstructures for specific applications. © 2020 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; Laser beam powder bed fusion; Microstructure","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Laser beams; Morphology; Solidification; Ternary alloys; Textures; Titanium alloys; Columnar to equiaxed transition; Integrated approach; Manufacturing parameters; Phase transformation kinetics; Process structures; Solid state phase transformation; Solidification morphology; Thermal history; 3D printers","","","","","Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, (16/RC/3872); Science Foundation Ireland, SFI; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER","This publication has emanated from research supported in part by a research grant from Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) under grant number 16/RC/3872 and is co-funded under the European Regional Development Fund and by I-Form industry partners .

However, it is of increasing interest due to the offer of geometrical design freedom and significant weight reduction. The electrical properties of additive manufactured components are still inferior to traditional manufacturing techniques owing to the poor surface finish, especially on overhanging surfaces, which are unavoidable in three-dimensional microwave components. In this paper we present experimental findings on the disparity in microwave surface resistance values between three common build orientations, as well as findings that establish a connection between increasing downskin laser power and a reduction in surface resistance for overhanging surfaces. Finally, additive manufactured rectangular waveguide sections are measured to assess the influence of combined upward and downward facing surfaces on surface resistance.  © 2013 IEEE.","Additive manufacture; laser power; metals; microwave; surface resistance; waveguide","3D printers; Additives; Microwaves; Build orientation; Downward facing surfaces; Geometrical designs; Microwave components; Microwave surface resistance; Passive microwaves; Surface finishes; Traditional manufacturing; Surface resistance","","","","","","","Aboulkhair N.T., Everitt N.M., Ashcroft L., Tuck C., Reducing porosity in AlSi10Mg parts processed by selective laser melting, Additive Manuf., 1-4, pp. 77-86, (2014); Williams H., Butler-Jones E., Additive manufacturing standards for space resource utilization, Additive Manuf., 28, pp. 676-681, (2019); Khajavi S.H., Partanen J., Holmstrom J., Additive manufacturing in the spare parts supply chain, Comput.
