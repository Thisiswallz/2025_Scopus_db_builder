The natural fiber granulated composites are prepared using the powdered form of sugarcane, jute, ramie, banana, pineapple fiber, and seashell powder with a volume fraction of 0.8. In the hybrid additive manufacturing technique, the fused deposited modeling (FDM) machine is modified by combining with the shape deposition modeling (SDM) to print the specimens layer by layer, and the influence of the number of layers on the mechanical properties is analyzed. The results concluded that increasing the number of layers from 6 to 12 improved the mechanical properties such as tensile strength, flexural strength, impact strength, and hardness values by 40.84, 50.04, 21.55, and 20.55%, respectively. Further, a novel technique can be utilized for developing the composites in replacement with conventional methods. © 2021 R.

Methods: Osteoblast cells and bacterial biofilm growth ability on specimen was examined and the effect of surface state on corrosion resistance was evaluated by electrochemical and immersion methods. Results: High survival of hFOB cells, as well as a strong tendency for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus biofilm proliferation on the surface of the tested specimens were shown. SLM-processed AZ31B alloy has a higher corrosion resistance in 0.9% NaCl solution and in a multi-electrolyte saline solution than the material in a conventional form of a rolled sheet. Conclusions: It has been demonstrated that the strong development of the surface of as-built processed specimens results in a significantly increased corrosion rate, which hinders the production of complex structures in tissue engineering products that support cell ingrowth. © 2021, Institute of Machine Design and Operation.

A minimization procedure is proposed to orient the design of a vertical take-off and landing drone towards sustainability. The vehicle is a novel cycloidal rotor drone and the principal objective is to yield the best ratio of payload to power consumption. The drone blades, rotor arms, and frame are designed for fused deposition modeling additive manufacturing with polylactic acid. 10 variables for the geometry, operation parameters, and material infill percentages are explored in search of the optimum design. A special derivation procedure allows obtaining the symbolic equations for the weight and power consumption of the drone. This permits optimization with a hybrid genetic and gradient method and exploring a broad range of aircraft sizes. 7 constraint equations ensure that the necessary assumptions made for the derivation remain valid and that the structural strength is adequate. For each new configuration, this method allows to quickly find a new optimum design using a desktop computer. Also, modifying the constraints, variables, or objective function is straightforward. Finally, the resulting design has a power loading of 0.0876 N/W. © 2021 Published by Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz","3D printing; Cycloidal rotors; Drones; Payload; Power loading","","","","","","Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung, AvH","Louis Gagnon would like to recognize the funding of the Polimi International Fellowship research grant Index no. 1378 - Ref.

When the shell-based TPMS structure’s thickness decreases, higher porosity and a larger surface-to-volume ratio can be achieved, which results in an improvement in the properties of the lattice structures. Micro LPBF, which combines finer laser beam, smaller powder, and thinner powder layer, is employed in this work to fabricate the thin-walled structures (TWS) of TPMS lattice by stainless steel 316 L (SS316L). Utilizing this system, the optimal parameters for printing TPMS-TWS are explored in terms of densification, smoothness, limitation of thickness, and dimensional accuracy. Cube samples with 99.7% relative density and a roughness value of 2.1 µm are printed by using the energy density of 100 J/mm3 . Moreover, a thin (100 µm thickness) wall structure can be fabricated through optimizing parameters. Finally, the TWS samples with various TPMS structures are manufactured to compare their heat dissipation capability. As a result, TWS sample of TPMS lattice exhibits a larger temperature gradient in the vertical direction compared to the benchmark sample. The steady-state temperature of the sample base presents a 7 K decrease via introducing TWS. © 2021 by the authors.

Traditional methods for manufacturing wicking structures within HPs and VCs involve secondary manufacturing processes and are generally limited to simple geometries. This work aims to leverage the unprecedented level of design freedom of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing (AM) to produce integrated wicking structures for HPs and VCs. Design/methodology/approach: Copper wicking structures are fabricated through LPBF via partial sintering and via the formation of square, hexagonal and rectangular arrangements of micro-pins and micro-grooves, produced in multiple build directions. Wicks are characterized by conducting capillary performance analysis through the measurement of porosity, permeability and capillary rate-of-rise. Findings: Copper wicking structures were successfully fabricated with capillary performance, K/reff, ranging from 0.186–1.74 µm. The rectangular-arrangement micro-pin wick presented the highest performance. Originality/value: This work represents the first published report on LPBF AM of copper wicking structures for HPs/VCs applications and represents foundational knowledge for fabricating complete assemblies of copper VCs and HPs through LPBF AM. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing; Copper; Porous materials; Thermal management; Vapor chamber; Wick","3D printers; Additives; Copper; Heat pipes; Sintering; Build direction; Capillary performance; Design/methodology/approach; Integral components; Manufacturing process; Partial sintering; Simple geometries; Wicking structure; Fabrication","","","","","SET Group, LLC, (80NSSC18C0125); National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (FY 2017 SBIR topic S3.03); National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA","Funding: This work was supported by SET Group, LLC though prime contract number 80NSSC18C0125 from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration under FY 2017 SBIR topic S3.03.

On the other hand, four-dimensional (4D) printing is an emerging technology, which involves 3D printing of smart materials that can respond to external stimuli such as heat. This short communication introduces the proof of concept of merging origami and 4D printing technologies to develop minimally invasive delivery of functional biomedical scaffolds with high shape recovery. The shape-memory effect (SME) of the PLA filament and the origami designs were also assessed in terms of deformability and recovery rate. The results showed that herringbone tessellation origami structure combined with internal natural cancellous bone core satisfies the design requirement of foldable scaffolds. The substantial and consistent SME of the 4D printed herringbone tessellation origami, which exhibited 96% recovery compared to 61% for PLA filament, was the most significant discovery of this paper. The experiments demonstrated how the use of 4D printing in situ with origami structures could achieve reliable and repeatable results, therefore conclusively proving how 4D printing of origami structures can be applied to biomedical scaffolds. © 2020 by the authors.

However, its implementation to practical engineering applications is impeded by the fact that the existing direct 4D printing methods could not render both the large bending curvature and high loading capacity at the same time. Herein, we report a multimaterial direct 4D printing method to fabricate patterned laminate that consists of covalently bonded elastomer and high-water-content hydrogel. The dehydration induced large volumetric shrinkage (up to 60%) and great modulus escalation (from 100 kPa to 4 GPa) allow the printed flat patterns to evolve into complex 3D structures with large bending curvature (up to 0.7 mm−1) and high bending stiffness (up to 104 MPa m3). To facilitate the structural design, we develop a phenomenological model to describe the dehydration induced shrinkage and stiffening, and implement this model into Euler–Bernoulli beam theory and finite element simulations. Compared with other 3D printing technologies, the proposed multimaterial direct 4D printing approach demonstrates the merits in terms of less building time and high load capacity at both room temperature and high temperature. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","4D printing; Dehydration; High stiffness; Large bending curvature; Multimaterial","Dehydration; Shrinkage; Stiffness; Structural design; Bernoulli beam theory; Complex 3D geometry; Finite element simulations; High load capacity; Manufacturing strategy; Phenomenological modeling; Practical engineering applications; Volumetric shrinkage; 3D printers","","","","","Centers for Mechanical Engineering Research and Education, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, (RGDM1710205, RGDM1830206, RGDM1830501); Centers for Mechanical Engineering Research and Education, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11802233); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Digital Manufacturing and Design Centre, Singapore University of Technology and Design, DMAND, SUTD; Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2020B090923003); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province","Q.G. acknowledges the Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province, China (Grant No.: 2020B090923003), and the support by the Centers for Mechanical Engineering Research and Education at MIT, US and SUSTech, China.

The column specimens (Polylactic Acid) are fabricated using Fused Deposition Modeling 3D printer and subjected to quasi-static compressive loading to investigate their mechanical behavior (by modifying the specimens' cross-section patterns and folding angles). The column specimens are simulated by finite element analysis to understand how the stress distribution and local deformation affecting the stiffness, strength, and overall deformation. The experiments showed that introducing the pre-folded pattern in a thin-walled column with different cross-sections can dramatically lower its structural stiffness (85%) and compressive strength (69%), but increase its deformability (115%), which is good agreement with numerical simulation. The variation of cross-section patterns and pre-folding angle could effectively modify the compressive mechanical behavior. Moreover, the results demonstrate how the FDM 3D Printing method can be used in fabricating a thin-walled column with irregular shapes and then to modify its deformability. This finding can be useful for designing any complex structures requiring specific stiffness and deformation such as suspension devices, prosthetic devices in biomechanics, and robotic structures. © 2021 Tim Pengembang Jurnal UPI.","3D printing; Deformability; Engineering Polylactic acid (PLA); Pre-folded thin-walled column; Structural stiffness","","","","","","Sampoerna University","The authors express deep gratitude to the LPDP research grant, No. PRJ-85/LPDP/2020, and CRCS of Sampoerna University for providing generous funding for running this research.","Al-Kaseasbeh Q., Mamaghani I.

In this study, a metastable β Ti-12Mo-6Zr-2Fe (TMZF) alloy with highly dense structure was successfully fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) from low-cost elemental powders. The applied different scanning strategies (simple and chess scan), and post heat treatment can regulate both the texture and secondary phases. The formation of strong {100}< 001 > texture leads to the low elastic modulus of TMZF alloys, while nano-sized α"" phases induce significantly strengthening effect. The as-fabricated TMZF alloy via simple scanning strategy shows considerably high strength due to the high density of α"", ω phases and sessile dislocations, but it is brittle owing to the presence of ω phase. The TMZF alloy, manufactured using chess scanning strategy, possessed high yield strength of 1,026 MPa, low modulus of 85.7 GPa and good ductility of 12.7%. This results from its unique hierarchical microstructure containing α"" phases, heterogeneous grains and the formation of {100}< 001 > texture. After solution heat treatment, the specimens exhibit stronger {100} < 001 > texture, hence lower modulus of 70.9 GPa. High yield strength of 943 MPa was maintained due to the formation of plate-like α"" precipitates. The TMZF alloy fabricated by in-situ alloying based LPBF demonstrates comparable strength to that of Ti-6Al-4V alloy, but much lower elastic modulus, suggesting that it could be a potential candidate for some implant applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","In-situ alloying; Laser powder bed fusion; Mechanical properties; Phase transformation; β-titanium alloys","3D printers; Alloying; Aluminum alloys; Biocompatibility; Elastic moduli; Fabrication; Heat treatment; High strength alloys; Iron alloys; Metal implants; Scanning; Textures; Vanadium alloys; Yield stress; Zircaloy; Biomedical implants; Elemental powders; Hierarchical microstructures; Low elastic modulus; Post heat-treatment; Scanning strategies; Solution heat treatment; Strengthening effect; Titanium alloys","","","","","Presidential fund and Development and Reform Commission of Shenzhen Municipality; Royal Society International Exchange, (IEC\NSFC\191319); Guangdong Innovative and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program, (2016ZT06C279); Guangdong Innovative and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program; Central South University, CSU; Development and Reform Commission of Shenzhen Municipality; Shenzhen Fundamental Research Program, (JCYJ20170412153039309); Shenzhen Fundamental Research Program","Funding text 1: This work was financially supported by the Fundamental Research Program of Shenzhen (Grant No. JCYJ20170412153039309), and Guangdong Innovative & Entrepreneurial Research Team Program, China (No. 2016ZT06C279).

Researching and determining the optimal factors for biological fixation between the tendon and prosthesis is the crux for restoring limb function. In order to increase the growth of tendon fibers into the scaffold and reduce the formation of cicatricial tissue, selective laser melting (SLM) three-dimensional (3D) printing was used to prepare four types of cylindrical scaffold. The actual pore sizes of cuboids, which were used as the monomers, were 657.65, 527.15, 348.68, and 169.20 μm. Cell experiments showed that the greatest number of fibroblasts became adhered to and grew into the scaffold with an actual pore size of 527.15 μm. Each group of scaffolds was surgically implanted into a rabbit model of acute injury to the supraspinatus tendon. Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and hard tissue section staining were used to analyze the growth of tendon tissue in each group. We concluded that 527.15 μm is the best pore size for a titanium alloy surface to promote tendon ingrowth. The current study provides a reference for the clinical design of the pore size of tendon attachments onto the surfaces of tumor prostheses. © 2020","Pore size; Porous scaffold; Selective laser melting; Tendon ingrowth; Three-dimensional printing; Titanium alloy","Cell culture; Computerized tomography; Pore size; Prosthetics; Scaffolds (biology); Selective laser melting; Titanium alloys; Biological fixation; Micro computed tomography (micro-CT); Porous scaffold; Prosthetic implantation; Selective laser melting (SLM); Supraspinatus tendons; Tendon tissues; Three-dimensional (3D) printing; Tendons","","","","","Jilin Province Development and Reform Commission, (2018C010); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81802174, 81902227, 82072456); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2018 M631864); Department of Finance of Jilin Province, (2019SCZT046); Department of Science and Technology of Jilin Province, (20190303154SF, 20200201453JC, 20200201478JC); National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents, (BX201701278)","Funding: This research was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 81902227 , 81802174 , 82072456 ); the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2018 M631864); National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents of China (No. BX201701278 ); Department of Science and Technology of Jilin Province of China (No. 20190303154SF , 20200201478JC , 20200201453JC ); Jilin Province Development and Reform Commission of China (No. 2018C010 ); Department of Finance in Jilin Province of China (No. 2019SCZT046 ).

However, the nature of AM often requires multiple post processing techniques to be carried out to reach the desired material properties or required surface finish. This often involves heat treatment (HT), shot peening (SP) or laser shock peening (LSP). To date, hardly any process chain modelling has been carried out on manufacturing applications with AM. This investigation focuses on the finite element (FE) modelling of the complete manufacturing process chain of an AM impeller made of IN718, including the AM, HT, LSP and SP processes. The particular AM process applied to build the impeller is laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF). Each FE process is validated individually against experimental data before being applied to the impeller process chain. The validated data from each process is mapped to the next process in the chain to investigate the combined effects of manufacturing and post processing techniques. Results have shown that high tensile residual stresses induced by AM can be reduced by approximately 75% by applying HT. SP and LSP processes can further modify remaining tensile residual stresses after HT by inducing a layer of compressive stresses at the surface. In summary, this research work has demonstrated that the simulation of AM process chains using finite element techniques is sufficiently mature to support the product and process development of industrial AM components. © 2021","Additive manufacturing; Finite element analysis; Heat treatment; Laser shock peening; Manufacturing process chain; Shot peening","3D printers; Heat treatment; Impellers; Industrial research; Manufacturing data processing; Residual stresses; Shot peening; Surface hardening; Finite element techniques; Laser shock peening; Manufacturing applications; Manufacturing process chain; Post-processing techniques; Process development; Process-chain simulations; Tensile residual stress; Finite element method","","","","","EU H2020","The authors wish to acknowledge the UK High Value Manufacturing Catapult for the financial support for the development and validation of all numerical models.

This paper presents the characterization of polymer-based 3-D printed components and complete subsystems for quasi-optical applications operating at G-band (140 to 220 GHz). Two low-cost consumer-level 3-D printing technologies (vat polymerization and fused deposition modeling) are employed, normally associated with microwave frequencies and longer wavelength applications. Here, five different quasi-optical component types are investigated; rectangular horn antennas, 90° off-axis parabolic mirrors, radiation absorbent material (RAM), grid polarizers and dielectric lenses. As an alternative to conventional electroplating, gold-leaf gilding is used for the polarizer. A detailed investigation is undertaken to compare the performance of our 3-D printed antennas, mirrors and RAM with their commercial equivalents. In addition, a fully 3-D printed, RAM-lined housing with central two-axis rotational platform is constructed for performing two-port measurements of a quasi-optical horn-mirror-polarizer-mirror-horn subsystem. Measured results generally show excellent performances, although the grid polarizer is limited by the minimum strip width, separation distance and metallization thickness. The ultra-low cost, 'plug and play' housing is designed to give a fast measurement setup, while minimizing misaligning losses. Its RAM lining is designed to suppress reflections due to diffraction from components under test that may cause adverse multi-path interference. Our work investigates each component type at G-band and integrates them within subsystem assemblies; operating at frequencies well above those normally associated with low-cost consumer-level 3-D printing technologies. This opens-up new opportunities for rapid prototyping of complete low-cost front-end quasi-optical upper-millimeter-wave subsystems. © 2013 IEEE.","3-D printing; Additive manufacturing; dielectric lens; G-band; grid polarizer; horn antenna; millimeter-wave; parabolic mirror; quasi-optical; RAM; WR-5","Adsorbents; Costs; Fused Deposition Modeling; Horn antennas; Housing; Lenses; Microstrip antennas; Millimeter waves; Mirrors; Optical instruments; Plating; Absorbent materials; Integrated subsystems; Metallization thickness; Multi-path interference; Off-axis parabolic mirrors; Port measurements; Quasi-optical components; Separation distances; Three dimensional computer graphics","","","","","U.K. Space Agency, (NSTP3-FT-046, RP10G0435A202)","This work was supported by the U.K. Space Agency’s Centre for Earth Observation Instrumentation (CEOI) under Grant RP10G0435A202, and in part by the U.K. Space Agency under Grant NSTP3-FT-046.","D'Auria M., Otter W.J., Hazell J., Gillatt B.T.W., Long-Collins C., Ridler N.M., Lucyszyn S., 3-D printed metal-pipe rectangular waveguides, IEEE Trans.

But hitherto, little has been reported on the repair of PLA-HAp-CS based orthopedic scaffolds, especially in case of minor surface cracks observed post-surgery (maybe because of residual stresses/accident, etc.) from mechanical, thermal, in-vitro, in-vivo, and morphological analysis viewpoint. In this study, the 3D printed scaffolding structures of PLA-HAp-CS (3D printed on FDM) were further joined by friction stir spot welding (FSSW) process for minor repairs (such as surface cracks). The joints formed by the FSSW process were subjected to mechanical, thermal, cytotoxicity (by in-vitro, in-vivo analysis) and morphological analysis. The study results suggest that joints prepared using the consumable tool in FSSW have good mechanical, thermal stability, a good range of biocompatibility, and suitable tissue engineering applications. For FSSW of 3D printed scaffolding structures of PLA-HAp-CS, 1000 rpm tool rotational speed, 4 mm consumable plunge depth, and 40 s stirring time are the optimized set of process parameters. The results are also supported by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. © 2021 CIRP","Flexural strength; In-vitro; In-vivo analysis; Orthopedic scaffoldings;

Several laser irradiation conditions were examined to optimize the manufacturing process to obtain a high volume density of the fabricated alloy. Good fabricated samples with a relative density of 99% or higher were obtained with no cracks. The fabricated samples exhibited significantly good mechanical properties, such as ultimate tensile strength, breaking elongation, and micro-hardness, compared to the conventional die casting AlSi12CuNi alloy. Fine microstructures consisting of the α-Al phase and a nanosized eutectic Al-Si network were observed. The dimensions of the microstructures were smaller than those of the conventional die-casting AlSi12CuNi alloy. The superior mechanical properties were attributed to the microstructure associated with the rapid solidification in the L-PBF process. Furthermore, the influence of the building direction on the mechanical properties of the fabricated samples was evaluated. The ultimate tensile strength and breaking elongation were significantly affected by the building direction; mechanical properties parallel to the roller moving direction were significantly better than those perpendicular to the roller moving direction. In conclusion, AlSi12CuNi alloys with good characteristics were successfully fabricated by the L-PBF process. © Fuji Technlogy Press Ltd.","AlSi12CuNi alloy; Laser powder bed fusion; Mechanical property; Microstructure","3D printers; Die casting; Microhardness; Microstructure; Rapid solidification; Rollers (machine components); Silicon; Tensile strength; Breaking elongation; Fabricated alloys; Fine microstructure; Irradiation conditions; Manufacturing process; Manufacturing techniques; Microstructure and mechanical properties; Ultimate tensile strength; Fabrication","","","","","","","Calignano F., Manfredi D., Ambrosio E.

In this work, a multi-material, shape-changing nozzle—constructed by means of PolyJet 3D printing—is presented that allows for the spatial distribution of short fibers embedded in polymer matrices to be modulated on demand throughout extrusion-based deposition processes. Specifically, the nozzle comprises flexible bladders that can be inflated pneumatically to alter the geometry of the material extrusion channel from a straight to a converging–diverging configuration, and in turn, the directional orientation of fibers within printed filaments. Experimental results for printing carbon microfiber-hydrogel composites reveal that increasing the nozzle actuation pressure from 0 to 100 kPa reduced the proportion of aligned fibers, and notably, prompted a transition from anisotropic to isotropic water-induced swelling properties (i.e., the ratio of transverse to longitudinal swelling strain decreased from 1.73 ± 0.37 to 0.93 ± 0.39, respectively). In addition, dynamically varying the nozzle geometry during the extrusion of continuous composite filaments effects distinct swelling behaviors in adjacent regions, suggesting potential utility of the presented approach for emerging “4D printing” applications. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","3D printing; 4D printing; additive manufacturing; direct ink writing","Additives; Composite structures; Extrusion; Fibers; Nozzles; Swelling; Carbon microfibers; Deposition process; Directional orientation; Hydrogel composites; Nozzle geometries; Potential utility; Swelling behavior; Swelling properties; 3D printers","","","","","John Abrahams and Mark Lecates; National Science Foundation, NSF, (IIS‐1612736); National Science Foundation, NSF","Funding text 1: The authors greatly appreciate the contributions of Maxwell Tsurumoto, Aditya Sangli, Michael Restaino, Marcello Arispe‐Guzman, and Zachary Ferraro as well as additional members of the Bioinspired Advanced Manufacturing (BAM) Laboratory and the Advanced Manufacturing and Polymer Processing Laboratory.

This study aims to address the lack of faithful and available in vitro models for patient-specific drug screening for HCC. We recently established a novel modeling system using three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technology and constructed hepatorganoids with HepaRG cells, which retain the liver function and prolong the survival of mice with liver failure after abdominal transplantation. Here we extend this modeling system to establish individualized model for hepatocellular carcinoma. HCC specimens were obtained from six patients after surgery. Primary HCC cells were isolated and mixed with gelatin and sodium alginate to form the bioink for printing. Patient-derived three-dimensional bio-printed HCC (3DP-HCC) models were successfully established afterward and grew well during long-term culture. These models retained the features of parental HCCs, including stable expression of the biomarker, stable maintenances of the genetic alterations and expression profiles. 3DP-HCC models are capable of displaying the results of drug screening intuitively and quantitatively. In conclusion, 3DP-HCC models are faithful in vitro models that are reliable in long-term culture and able to predict patient-specific drugs for personalized treatment. © 2020","3D bio-printing; Drug screening; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Patient-specific treatment","Animals; Bioprinting; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Mice; Precision Medicine; Printing, Three-Dimensional; 3D printers; Mammals; Patient treatment; Sodium alginate; alginic acid; gelatin; Expression profile; Genetic alterations; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Liver functions; Long-term culture; Patient specific; Stable expression; Threedimensional (3-d); adult; aged; Article; cancer survival; cell culture; cell growth; cell isolation; clinical article; controlled study; DNA modification; drug screening; female; gene expression profiling; HepaRG cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; liver cell carcinoma; liver failure; liver function; male; middle aged; personalized medicine; priority journal; quantitative analysis; survival time; three dimensional bioprinting; tumor volume; animal; bioprinting; genetics; liver tumor; mouse; personalized medicine; three dimensional printing; Diagnosis","","alginic acid, 28961-37-7, 29894-36-8, 9005-32-7, 9005-38-3; gelatin, 9000-70-8","","","CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; CIFMS, (2016-I2M-1-001); International Science and Technology Cooperation Projects; Ministry of Science and Technology of China; Tsinghua University-Peking Union Medical College Hospital Cooperation Project; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (31522038, 31571509, 31970687, 51805294, 81730078); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST, (2016YFA0100500, 2019YFA0801501); Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST; Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences, CAMS; Tsinghua University, THU, (PTQH201904552); Tsinghua University, THU; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, CAMS, (2019XK320006); Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, CAMS; Shenzhen Fundamental Research and Discipline Layout project, (JCYJ20170412101508433, JCYJ20180507183655307); Shenzhen Fundamental Research and Discipline Layout project; International Science and Technology Cooperation Programme, ISTCP, (2016YFE0107100); International Science and Technology Cooperation Programme, ISTCP; Shenzhen Fundamental Research Program","Funding text 1: This work was supported by grants from the CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences ( CIFMS ) (No. 2016-I2M-1-001 ) and Tsinghua University - Peking Union Medical College Hospital Cooperation Project ( PTQH201904552 ).

Since this printing technology makes the bodies anisotropic, therefore, investigate the process with different settings is worthwhile. Tensile test specimens of two plastics have been carried out to examine the mechanical properties. Polylactic acid (PLA) and High Temperature PLA (HT-PLA) are the used materials for this purpose. A total of seventy-two test pieces of the two used polymers were printed and evaluated. Three parameters were examined in twelve different settings when printing the tensile test specimens. The considered settings are; six raster directions, three build orientations and two filling factors. The differences in stress-strain curves, tensile strength values and elongation at break were compared among the tested samples. The broken specimens after the tensile test are illustrated, which gave insight into how the test pieces printed with different parameters were fractured. The optimum printing setting is represented at crossed 45/−45° raster direction, X orientation and 100 % fill factor, where the highest tensile strength of 59.7 MPa at HT-PLA and the largest elongation of about 3.5 % at PLA were measured. © 2021 Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

To date, this approach has demonstrated the ability to design inherent damping capability in LPBF parts that can suppress vibration by 88–95% compared to fully fused counterparts, and the damping capability is a product of only 1–4% unfused powder volume. Despite the documented proof that inherent damping with LPBF can be successful, there are a number of additional demonstrations required to improve the applicability of the approach for turbine engines. Of specific interest in this study is the damping performance sustainability at high strains. This study investigates LPBF nickel-based alloy 718 beams with six different internal geometries and assesses the effects of internal features on damping performance and sustainability. First, the initial/inherent damping performances are compared against undamped results; second, damping sustainability is conducted by subjecting the parts to high strain amplitude loading. Results from this study show a trend in the effects of unfused powder volume on inherent damping performance. In addition, subtle changes in damping performance at higher strains indicate that there are specific internal features more preferable for sustainability of inherent damping. © AIAA International.

To take full advantage of modern GPU computing, a matrix-free preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) finite element algorithm with voxel mesh is proposed to solve the transient heat transfer problem involved in the L-PBF process. The accuracy of the developed simulator is demonstrated by comparing with a commercial software (ANSYS) using representative L-PBF process parameters and temperature-dependent thermal properties for Ti6Al4V. For efficiency, it is found that the process simulation has a significant speedup going from a single CPU to a single GPU implementation. A speedup is also observed with the matrix-free method compared to a linear solver using a sparse matrix, both on a single GPU. In addition, several schemes devised to gain higher efficiency are discussed in details, which include exclusion of inactive elements from the memory, adaptive meshing in the build direction, preconditioner, and layer lumping. Using these schemes, the adaptability and scalability of the developed simulator are demonstrated on a complex geometry. A calibration of the model is also performed in realistic conditions with a thermocouple measurement coming from experimental data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Finite element analysis; GPU computing; Heat transfer modeling; Laser powder bed fusion; Matrix-free method; Process simulation","3D printers; Computer software; Efficiency; Graphics processing unit; Heat transfer; Simulators; Thermocouples; Finite element algorithms; Matrix-free methods; Preconditioned conjugate gradient; Process simulations; Realistic conditions; Temperature-dependent thermal property; Thermocouple measurements; Transient heat transfer; Matrix algebra","","","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (80NSSC19M0123); National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA; University of Texas at El Paso, UTEP","The financial support from the NASA University Leadership (ULI) program in USA under award No 80NSSC19M0123 is gratefully acknowledged.

The polymer composites were extruded into filaments (BNNTs at 10 wt. %) for 3D printing, utiliz-ing the fused deposition modeling (FDM) technique to fabricate parts for mechanical and thermal applications. Using a direct mixing process, we found that the thermal conductivity and the mechanical strength of the PS-BNNT composite were respectively four times and two times higher compared to the sonication method. The thermal stability and glass transition temperatures were positively affected. A 2D microstructural mechanical entanglement model captured the exact geometry of the nanotubes using the MultiMechanics software, and the performance of the additive manufactured (AM) PS-BNNT composites part for thermomechanical application was simulated in COMSOL. The modified direct mixing process for PS-BNNT, which affects morphology, proved to be effective in achieving better interfacial bonding, indicating that BNNTs are promising fillers for improving thermal and mechanical properties, and are applicable for thermal management and electronic packaging. © 2021 by the authors.

Here we report that additively manufactured 304L austenitic stainless steel (SS) with low stacking fault energy (SFE) show superior fatigue resistance than its conventional counterparts due to the unique heterogeneous microstructure despite containing relatively high porosity. A series of detailed microstructural characterisations were applied to systematically disclose the fatigue enhancement mechanism of additively manufactured parts. Direct evidence is offered to show the obvious progressive work hardening and strain rate hardening caused by the heterogeneous microstructure during cyclic deformation, thus enhancing the fatigue crack initiation resistance. The microstructural results reveal that the cellular substructure plays a decisive role in regulating the dislocation motion during cyclic deformation, resulting in the intergranular fatigue cracking along HAGBs rather than twin boundaries. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Additive manufacturing; fatigue resistance; microstructure; working hardening mechanisms","Additives; Austenitic stainless steel; Cracks; Deformation; Selective laser melting; Strain hardening; Strain rate; Textures; Cellular sub-structure; Enhancement mechanism; Fatigue crack initiation; Heterogeneous microstructure; Low stacking fault energies; Revolutionary technology; Selective laser melting (SLM); Strain-rate hardening; Fatigue of materials","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52075087); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Northeastern University, NEU; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (N2003006, U1708254); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","Funding text 1: The work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 52075087), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (grant number N2003006), National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number U1708254).

Design/methodology/approach: Making use of a space filling design of experiments, a wide range of laser sintering parameters is covered. Surface morphology is assessed by means of profile measurements and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. Mechanical testing, SEM, X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to assess the influence of energy density on structural and mechanical properties. Findings: Results show a high dependency of the properties on the laser energy density and also a compromise existing between laser exposure parameters and desired properties of laser sintered parts. Surface roughness could be associated to overlap degree when using higher scan line spacing values and lower laser speeds improved surface roughness when high scan line spacing is used. Higher mechanical properties were found at higher energy density levels, but excessively high energy density decreased mechanical properties. A transition from brittle to ductile fracture with increasing energy density could be clearly observed by mechanical analysis and SEM. XRD and DSC measurements show a decrease on the crystal fraction with increasing energy densities, which corroborated the plastic behavior observed, and FTIR measurements revealed polymer degradation through chain scission might occur at too high energy densities. Originality/value: Valuable guidelines are given regarding energy density optimization for SLS of PA12 considering not only quality criteria but also microstructure characteristics. Surface properties are studied based on the concept of degree of overlap between laser scanning lines. For the first time, crystallization behavior of SLS PA12 parts produced at different energy levels was studied by means of XRD measurements. Polymer degradation of SLS PA12 parts was evaluated with FTIR, which is a non-destructive and easy test to be conducted. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing; Laser energy density; PA12; Selective laser sintering","Crystallization; Design of experiments; Differential scanning calorimetry; Ductile fracture; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Laser heating; Mechanical testing; Morphology; Scanning electron microscopy; Selective laser sintering; Sintering; Surface morphology; Surface roughness; X ray diffraction; Crystallization behavior; Design/methodology/approach; Differential scanning calorimeters; Microstructure characteristics; Physical and mechanical properties; Scanning electron microscopy image; Selective laser sintering(SLS); Structural and mechanical properties; Density (specific gravity)","","","","","Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos, FINEP","The authors would like to thank FINEP for the financial support.","Designation: D, (2002); Standard test methods for flexural properties of unreinforced and reinforced plastics and electrical insulating materials, West Conshohocken, (2002); Athreya S.R., Kalaitzidou K., Das S., Processing and characterization of a carbon black-filled electrically conductive nylon-12 nanocomposite produced by selective laser sintering, Materials Science and Engineering: A, 527, 10-11, pp. 2637-2642, (2010); Atkins E.D.T., Hill M.J.J., Veluraja K., Structural and morphological investigations of nylon 8 chain-folded lamellar crystals, Polymer, 36, 1, pp. 35-42, (1995); Caulfield B., McHugh P.E., Lohfeld S., Dependence of mechanical properties of polyamide components on build parameters in the SLS process, Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 182, 1-3, pp. 477-488, (2007); Cavazzuti M., Optimization Methods: From Theory to Design, (2013); Celina M., Ottesen D.K., Gillen K.T., Clough R.L., FTIR emission spectroscopy applied to polymer degradation, Polymer Degradation and Stability, 58, 1-2, pp. 15-31, (1997); Das S., Beama J.J., Wohlert M., Bourell D.L., Journal R.P., Iss V., Beaman J.J., Et al., Direct laser freeform fabrication of high performance metal components, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 4, 3, pp. 112-117, (1998); Drummer D., Wudy K., Drexler M., Influence of energy input on degradation behavior of plastic components manufactured by selective laser melting, Physics Procedia, 56, pp. 176-183, (2014); Dupin S., Lame O., Barres C., Charmeau J.-Y.Y., Microstructural origin of physical and mechanical properties of polyamide 12 processed by laser sintering, European Polymer Journal, 48, 9, pp. 1611-1621, (2012); Material data center, (2020); Gogolewski S., Czerniawska K., Gasiorek M., Effect of annealing on thermal properties and crystalline structure of polyamides.

Design/methodology/approach: To exploit the additive manufacturing (AM) advantages, the retrieving of the reconfiguration part data was provided, the process strategies by means of the interchange file handling and pre and post-processing were investigated and a re-design of the part was developed. Finally, the fabricated part was tested and analyzed. Findings: Results claimed that a reconfiguration of the manufacturing framework plays an important role at each step of the process otherwise many AM benefits can be lost. In the paper, a set of recommendations, suggestions and hints regarding the implementation of AM for part substitutions is provided. Research limitations/implications: Many aspects of the AM adoption, such as the production cost, energy consumption, sustainability and production volume, depend upon the geometry, batch size and other impactful factors, and thus they need to be studied in a case-by-case manner. Practical implications: The proposed approaches have the concrete aim to address industrial resources toward the maximization of AM benefits in part substituting. Originality/value: In this paper, the substitution of a part is fully undertaken from the early data collection to the manufactured part testing providing integrated approaches for each process step. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Component manufacturing; Design for additive manufacturing; Orientation; Selective laser melting","Additives; Aircraft; Energy utilization; Fabrication; Selective laser melting; Design/methodology/approach; Fabricated parts; Industrial resources; Integrated approach; Process strategies; Production cost; Production volumes; Traditional manufacturing; Manufacturing data processing","","","","","Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering of Sapienza University of Rome; Italian Air Force research center","The authors wish to thank the Italian Air Force research center “Centro Sperimentale Volo” for making available the RSV and RTMAS personnel to cooperate to the realization of the new MB-339CD stand-by-compass element and making possible to make it “airborne”.

The RAI was tested with a fatigue test system according to ISO 14801, maximum compression load is 350 N, 450 N and 500 N, the load tilt angle is 30°, R = 0.1. To simulate the stress distribution of implant and alveolar bone, a finite-element model was established. The elastic modulus of implant materials was set to 90 GPa and 110 GPa to simulate CP Ti and Ti-6Al-4V, respectively. 300 N vertical or 300 N vertical/50 N horizontal occlusal loading was applied. The biomechanical behaviour of peri-implant bone was recorded. Fatigue strength of RAI sample was 500 N. The simulation results showed that at 300 N vertical loading or 300 N vertical/50 N horizontal loading, compared with Ti-6Al-4V, CP Ti had lower von Mises stress on implant and abutment which reduces the risk of failure compared to their respective strength levels; meanwhile, higher von Mises stress on alveolar bone reduces stress shielding. The study underscores that the CP Ti and SLM are favourable for the fabrication of RAI. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Commercially pure titanium; elastic modulus; fatigue test; selective laser melting; stress shielding effect","Fatigue testing; Selective laser melting; Stress analysis; Titanium; Titanium metallography; Commercially Pure titaniums; Compression loads; Horizontal loading; Implant materials; Peri-implant bones; Selective laser melting (SLM); Stress shielding; Vertical loadings; Fatigue of materials","","","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFB1101200); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFB1101200).

For this purpose, firstly the multi-layer lenses are designed using Invasive Weed Optimization (IWO) and simulated in 3-D CST Microwave Studio (MWS) environment as consisting of square-shaped five layers with variable dielectric constants and heights. Thus, optimum values of the dielectric constants and heights are resulted limiting from 1.15 to 2.1 and 9.2 mm to 10 mm, respectively compatible for Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) based 3D-printing process. Finally, the optimum lens is realized by 3D printer via FDM evaluating infill rate of cheap Polylactic Acid (PLA) material for each layer. The simulated and measured performance of the multi-layer dielectric structures are hand to hand. The horn antenna equipped by our proposed dielectric lens achieves gain enhancement of the traditional antenna up to 2.9 dB over the operation band. Furthermore, the proposed design is compared with the counterpart designs in literature and based on the comparison results it can be said that the proposed design achieves the better performance in the smaller in size as equipped a traditional X-band horn antenna. © 2021 Applied Computational Electromagnetics Society (ACES).

Only one paper describes the auxetic nails. None of them analyzed the impact of using auxetics on the strength of furniture joints. The aim of this investigation was to design and manufacture different kinds of auxetic dowels with corresponding muffs and experimentally, theoretically, and numerically analyze the minimum mounting forces, contact pressures, and friction coefficients of these dowels in particleboard. Firstly, auxetic properties of the dowels were numerically determined, and then obtained values were confirmed by real compression tests in order to be sure that the dowels had negative Poisson's ratios. All dowels were manufactured from polyamide (PA12) with 3D printing Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) technology. Static compression tests were carried out for obtaining the minimum mounting force needed to insert the dowel into the muff. Numerical analyses were performed by means of Abaqus/Explicit v6.14-2 software. Contact pressures and friction coefficients were also theoretically calculated and compared to the results of numerical analyses and real tests. At the end of the tests, the auxetic dowels gave lower mounting force values than the non-auxetic dowels. Mounting force values of dowels decreased as the dowel hole diameter and size of inclusions are increased. Furthermore, the contact pressures on the surface of the auxetic dowels were considerably lower than in the non-auxetic dowels. In conclusion, it could be said that the auxetic dowels could be utilized as an alternative fastener for the traditional furniture dowels. Therefore, withdrawal strength and corner joint tests of the auxetic dowels should be investigated in future studies. © 2020 The Author(s)","Auxetic; Contact pressure; Dowel; FEM; Friction; Mounting force","ABAQUS; Compression testing; Friction; Laser heating; Numerical analysis; Selective laser sintering; Contact pressures; Design and manufactures; Experimental and numerical analysis; Friction coefficients; Negative poisson's ratios; Selective laser sintering(SLS); Static compression; Withdrawal strength; design; experimental study; finite element method; force; friction; manufacturing; numerical model; pressure effect; theoretical study; Fasteners","","","","","Ministerstwo Edukacji i Nauki, MNiSW","The paper was financed also within the framework of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education programme “Regional Initiative of Excellence” in years 2019-2022, Project No. 005/RID/2018/19.

In this study, the characteristics such as the density, up-skin and down-skin roughness and dimensional accuracy of selective laser melting forming technology manufacturing (SLMed) AlSi10Mg cellular lattice structure were carried. This work reveals the effect of the strut size and tilt angle on the geometric characteristics of SLMed AlSi10Mg and is benefit for controlling the forming performance of the SLMed cellular lattice structure. Design/methodology/approach: Based on AlSi10Mg powder, the influence of the tilt angle changed from 10° to 45° with an increment of 5° were investigated, the influence of the strut size was varied from 0.4 mm to 1.2 mm with an increment of 0.2 mm were investigated. The characteristics such as the density, up-skin and down-skin roughness, dimensional accuracy and mechanical properties of SLM-ed AlSi10Mg cellular lattice structure was carried. Findings: Greater than 99% relative density can be achieved for different strut size when optimal process parameters are used. In the optimized process interval, the struts with a tilt angle of 10° can still be formed well, which is higher than the design limit of the inclined angle given in the related literature. The tilt angle has a significant effect on the surface roughness of the strut. The microhardness reached to 157 ± 3 HV, and the maximum compressive strength was 58.86 MPa, with the optimal process parameters. Originality/value: In this study, the characteristics such as the density, up-skin and down-skin roughness and dimensional accuracy of SLMed AlSi10Mg cellular lattice structure were carried. With the optimal geometric parameters, the authors tested microhardness and compressive strength of the cellular lattice structure. The results of this study provide theoretical and experimental basis for the realization of high-quality manufacturing and optimization design of aluminum alloy cellular lattice structure, which will meet more diversified industrial needs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Aluminum alloy lattice structure; Density; Dimensional accuracy; Geometric characteristics; Roughness; Selective laser melting","Aluminum alloys; Cellular manufacturing; Compressive strength; Density (specific gravity); Geometry; Melting; Microhardness; Silicon; Structural design; Struts; Surface roughness; Cellular lattice structures; Densification behavior; Design/methodology/approach; Dimensional accuracy; Forming performance; Geometric characteristics; Maximum compressive strengths; Optimization design; Selective laser melting","","","","","Analytical and Testing Center of HUST; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51805184)","Funding text 1: This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51805184) supported this work.

However, several unexplained phenomena significantly affect the quality of fabricated components. In particular, it has been reported that the generation of spatters adversely affects the stability of fabrication process and degrades the performance of the fabricated components. To realize high-quality components, it is essential to suppress the generation of spatters. Thus far, the suppression of spatter generation has been attempted based on the process parameters; however, this has not been adequately discussed in terms of the fabrication atmosphere. Therefore, in this study, we focused on the fabrication atmosphere and investigated spatter generation using gas with different physical properties rather than conventionally used argon. It was observed that the spatter generation during the fabrication of the Ti6Al4V alloy could be significantly suppressed by changing the atmospheric gas, even under constant LPBF process parameters. We proved that the fabrication atmosphere is an important factor to be considered, apart from the process parameters, in AM technology.  © 2021 The Japan Institute of Metals and Materials.","Atmosphere; Biomaterials; Gas; Laser powder bed fusion; Spatter; Titanium alloy","3D printers; Aerospace industry; Aluminum alloys; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Arbitrary structures; Fabrication process; High-accuracy; High-quality components; Medical fields; Process parameters; Spatter generation; Ti-6Al-4V alloy; Fabrication","","","","","Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST; Cross-Ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program; Swine Innovation Porc, SIP; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (18H05254)","This work was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [grant number JP18H05254].

Using LBM technology, lighter and more compact antennas can be produced and manufacturing costs can be reduced. However, the surface roughness of internal surfaces in waveguides produced by LBM is much higher (about 10 μm Ra) than that produced by conventional manufacturing technologies. Consequently, such high surface roughness of the internal surface can affect electrical current propagation through the waveguide and corresponding transmitted power. In this paper, abrasive flow machining (AFM) was used to reduce the surface roughness of the internal surfaces of four different waveguides used at both K and Q bands. A significant reduction in the transmission loss at both K and Q bands was observed as their internal surface roughness decreased from about 10 μm to 1 μm Ra. This was assumed to be due to an increase of the internal surface electrical conductivity with the decrease of roughness in waveguides channels. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","abrasive flow machining (AFM); additive manufacturing; Electromagnetic performance; internal surface; laser beam melting (LBM); surface roughness; waveguide","3D printers; Aluminum alloys; Antenna feeders; Laser beam machining; Laser beams; Magnesium alloys; Melting; Silicon alloys; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Waveguides; Abrasive flow machining; Conventional manufacturing; Electrical current; Electromagnetic performance; Laser beam melting; Manufacturing cost; Transmission loss; Transmitted power; Surface roughness","","","","","Auvergne Rhône-Alpes; I@L Carnot MELTED","Funding text 1: The ‘La région Auvergne Rhône-Alpes' in France is acknowledged for funding the purchase of the AFM machine (Extrude Hone).

Before 3D printing, the carbon fibers pass through an ABS-acetone bath to prepare solution impregnated fibers (prepregs). Continuous fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites (CFRTCs) were printed by feeding carbon fiber prepregs and ABS filament, simultaneously into a special single port nozzle. By varying print conditions such as nozzle diameter, layer height, and print speed, composite specimens were printed with different qualities. The visual evaluation of printed composites was used to determine a process window for stable or unstable CFRTC printing. In the obtained process window, four regions were observed including fiber fuzzing or tearing instability, fiber twisting instability, low quality stable print and high quality stable print. The optimum condition to print CFRTCs was found and then specimens were printed to investigate mechanical properties under the optimal printing condition. The mechanical and morphological properties of visual-optimized 3D-printed composites, without any fiber fuzzing, tearing or twisting were investigated. The results showed that tensile, flexural, and interlaminar shear strength of 3D-printed ABS-carbon CFRTCs have increased 313%, 121%, and 54%, respectively, when compared with the neat ABS 3D-printed samples. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.","3D printing; ABS; carbon; composite; continuous; fiber; impregnation; process window; reinforcement; solution","Acetone; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fused Deposition Modeling; Graphite fibers; Nozzles; Shear strength; Styrene; Thermoplastics; Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene; Carbon fiber reinforced; Carbon fiber reinforced composite; Composite specimens; Fused deposition modeling (FDM); Inter-laminar shear strengths; Morphological properties; Tearing instability; Fibers","","","","","","","Francis V., Jain P.K., Investigation on the Effect of Surface Modification of 3D Printed Parts by Nanoclay and Dimethyl Ketone, Mater.

Polypropylene random copolymer (PPR) as a polymeric binder was mixed with 50 Wt.% of the selected conventional cation exchange resin, and a filament was prepared using a single screw mini extruder. Then filament was processed by FFF into the membranes with a defined 3D structure. Design/methodology/approach: Electrochemical properties, morphology, mechanical properties and water absorption properties were tested. Findings: Dependence of the tested properties on the used nozzle diameter was found. Both areal and specific resistances increased with increasing nozzle diameter. The same trend was also found for permselectivity. The optimal membrane with permselectivity above 90%, areal resistance of 8 O.cm2 and specific resistance of 124 O.cm2 was created using a nozzle diameter of 0.4 mm. Originality/value: Using new materials for 3D print of cation exchange membrane with production without waste. The possibility of producing 3D membranes with a precisely defined structure and using a cheap 3D printing method. New direction of membrane structure formation. 3D-printed heterogeneous cation exchange membranes were prepared, which can compete with commercial membranes produced by conventional technologies. 3D-printed heterogeneous cation exchange membranes were prepared, which can compete with commercial membranes produced by conventional technologies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","3D print;

In this work, microstructure evolution and tensile properties were studied in as-SLMed state and after various heat treatments, as well as the role of defects on its fracture mechanism at high temperature. The results indicated that the as-SLMed microstructure consisted of dendritic and cellular structure, while small γ′′ phases and acicular δ phases formed after heat treatments. Two types of defects, ‘X-shaped crack’ and ‘central crack’ were formed in the as-SLMed specimens during in-situ high temperature tensile process, which suggested that the melt pool boundaries and the center of melt pools were cracks initiation places because of high density of defects and segregation. Room temperature (RT) tensile strengths of the as-SLMed specimens exceeded the cast standard but were inferior to the wrought standard. Apparently, the standard heat treatment (SHT) and direct aging treatment (AG) specimens showed highest tensile strengths (1430 MPa at RT and 1189 MPa at 650 °C). RT tensile strengths of the SHT specimens were increased by 43.7 % when compared with those of the as-SLMed ones, even 12 % higher than those of wrought standard as a result of precipitation strengthening effect. However, elongation after heat treatments decreased significantly due to dislocation pinning effect from strengthening phases. Furthermore, the strengths and elongations in horizontal and vertical directions showed obvious anisotropy because of strong preferential texture in specimens formed during SLM process. This paper looks at microstructural evolution, mechanical properties evaluation of Inconel 718 fabricated by SLM under various heat treatments, the results showed that the tensile properties can be tuned via proper treatment to suit their application requirements. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Defect;

When the ball to powder ratio was in the range of 4 to 10, with the increasing of the ball to powder ratio, the dispersion of graphene was, improved; however, when the ball to powder ratio was higher than 8 it was not favourable to the dispersion of the graphene. When the ball milling rotational speed was in the range of 80 to 250 rpm, with the increasing of ball milling rotational speed, the distribution of graphene became homogeneous, but when the ball milling rotational speed was higher than 230 rpm, the Al powders were deformed. When the ball milling time was in the range of 0.5 to 3.0 hours, graphene was dispersed more homogeneously with the increase of ball milling time, when the ball milling time was more than 2.0 hours, the deformation of Al alloy powder occurred. When the ball to powder ratio was 8:1, the ball milling rotational speed was 230 rpm, and the ball milling time was 2.0 hours, the graphene/ AlSi10Mg composite powder with the homogeneous distribution of graphene was prepared.

The design and fabrication techniques introduced in this paper feature: 1) the use of low-cost rapid prototyping additive manufacturing based on polymer jetting (PJ), and 2) the use of commercially available through-substrate copper via transitions. In contrast to the conventional SIW designs and fabrications, this new approach does not rely on through-substrate via fabrication, hence avoiding some difficult manufacturing steps, such as through-substrate etching, via formation and via metallization, which are considered complex and expensive to implement. The 3D printed HSIWs in this article can achieve a propagation loss of lower than 1.56 Np/m (13.55 dB/m), which is considered one of the results with the lowest propagation loss achieved to date, when compared to the state-of-the-art. © 2013 IEEE.","additive manufacturing; millimeter waves; Substrate integrated waveguide","3D printers; 5G mobile communication systems; Costs; Etching; Fabrication; Internet of things; Robotics; Substrates; Fabrication technique; Nominal frequency; Propagation loss; Robotic applications; State of the art; Substrate etching; Via fabrication; Wired and wireless communications; Substrate integrated waveguides","","","","","Engineering and Physical Science Research Council; Of_ce of the Higher Education Commission; Office of the Higher Education Commission, OHEC, (MRG6280119); Office of the Higher Education Commission, OHEC; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/N010523/1, EP/S016813/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; Thailand Research Fund, TRF; King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok, KMUTNB, (KMUTNB-64-KNOW-44); King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok, KMUTNB","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by the Thailand Research Fund and Office of the Higher Education Commission through the Research Grant for New Scholar under Grant MRG6280119, in part by the King Mongkut’s University of Technology North Bangkok under Contract KMUTNB-64-KNOW-44, and in part by the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council under Grant EP/S016813/1 and Grant EP/N010523/1.; Funding text 2: This work was supported in part by the Thailand Research Fund and Of_ce of the Higher Education Commission through the Research Grant for New Scholar under Grant MRG6280119, in part by the King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok under Contract KMUTNB-64-KNOW-44, and in part by the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council under Grant EP/S016813/1 and Grant EP/N010523/1.","Pozar D.M., Microwave Engineering, 4th Ed, (2012); Robertson I.D., Somjit N., Chongcheawchamnan M., Microwave and Millimetre-Wave Design ForWireless Communication, (2016); Kai T., Acoaxial line to post-wallwaveguide transition for a cost-effective transformer between a RF-device and a planar slot-array antenna in 60-GHz band, Ieice Trans.

By fused deposition process the part is created layer by layer and the resulting part is characterized by high anisotropy, dictated mostly by printing parameters. To alleviate the anisotropy and to study the mechanical behavior of the 3D printed parts thermal processing is used. The materials used as filament is a poly (lactic acid) with copper particles embedded for antibacterial purposes. Samples were 3D printed using a commercial printer, thermally processed and tested in compression. On the failed specimens fracture investigations were performed to understand mechanical behavior during compression. The mechanical characteristics showed improvement and the anisotropy decreased as the processing temperature increased, but the samples became brittle. The mechanical behavior changed drastically on the thermally processed samples because of structural changes: a discontinuity between exterior layers and infill layers was created post layer fusion, the first region being the one stressed and failed first during tests. © 2021 Syscom 18 SRL.

Herein, the dislocation structures developed during electron beam and laser beam powder-bed fusion (EB-PBF and LB-PBF, respectively) of the Ti–6Al–4V alloy were quantitatively examined via X-ray diffraction (XRD) line profile analysis. The microstructures of both as-built samples were characterized, revealing fine acicular microstructures attributable to a β → α' martensitic transformation. While a fully α'-martensite matrix with a high dislocation density was formed and preserved during the LB-PBF process, the decomposition of the α'-martensite toward the thermodynamically stable α + β microstructure occurred during EB-PBF as a result of post-solidification exposure to high temperatures. Accordingly, a higher dislocation density and finer crystallite size were observed at the top cross-section from the XRD line profile analysis, suggesting that the extent of phase decomposition depended on the duration of the exposure to the elevated temperature. Nonetheless, the saturated dislocation density was as high as 1014 m−2, where dislocation strengthening affected the overall strength of the EB-PBF specimen. Diffraction peaks of sufficient intensity that enabled the analysis of the dislocation structures in both the α (α')-matrix and the nanosized β-phase precipitates at the α (α')-laths were obtained under high-energy synchrotron radiation; this revealed that the β-phase had a much higher dislocation density than the surrounding α (α')-matrix. The enhanced dislocation accumulation in the nanosized β-phase precipitates probably reflects the elemental partitioning that occurred during post-solidification cooling. The valuable insights provided in this study are expected to promote further development of alloy preparation using additive manufacturing processes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Dislocation structure; Martensitic transformation; Powder bed fusion; Ti–6Al–4V alloy; X-ray diffraction line profile analysis","3D printers; Additives; Aerospace industry; Crystallite size; Laser beams; Martensite; Martensitic transformations; Microstructure; Solidification; Synchrotron radiation; X ray diffraction; Additive manufacturing process; Dislocation accumulation; Dislocation strengthening; High dislocation density; High energy synchrotron; Manufacturing techniques; Thermodynamically stable; X ray diffraction line profile analysis; Titanium metallography","","","","","Yoshihiko Nagata and Kenya Kurita; Japan Titanium Society; Koiwai Co.

Among them, porous three-dimensional structures (scaffolds) composed mainly of bioabsorbable ce-ramics, such as hydroxyapatite (HAp) and β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) stand out for reducing the use of autogenous, homogeneous, and xenogenous bone grafts and their unwanted effects. In order to stimulate bone formation, biodegradable polymers such as cellulose, collagen, glycosaminoglycans, polylactic acid (PLA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL), polyglycolic acid (PGA), polyhydroxylbutyrate (PHB), polypropylenofumarate (PPF), polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), and poly L-co-D, L lactic acid (PLDLA) have also been studied. More recently, hybrid scaffolds can combine the tunable macro/microporosity and osteoinductive properties of ceramic materials with the chemical/physical properties of biodegradable polymers. Various methods are suggested for the manufacture of scaffolds with adequate porosity, such as conventional and additive manufacturing techniques and, more recently, 3D and 4D printing. The purpose of this manuscript is to review features concerning biomaterials, scaffolds macro and microstructure, fabrication techniques, as well as the potential interaction of the scaffolds with the human body. © 2021 by the authors.

Another purpose is to determine the optimum process parameters to achieve the maximum compressive yield stress and dimensional accuracy at the same time. Design/methodology/approach: The standard cylindrical specimens which produced from ABS by using an FDM 3D printer were measured dimensions and tested compressive yield stresses. The effects of six process parameters on the dimensional accuracy and compressive yield stress were investigated by separating the printing orientations into horizontal and vertical orientations before controlling five factors: nozzle temperature, bed temperature, number of shells, layer height and printing speed. After that, the optimum process parameters were determined to accomplish the maximum compressive yield stress and dimensional accuracy simultaneously. Findings: The maximum compressive properties were achieved when layer height, printing speed and number of shells were maintained at the lowest possible values. The bed temperature should be maintained 109°C and 120°C above the glass transition temperature for horizontal and vertical orientations, respectively. Practical implications: The optimum process parameters should result in better FDM parts with the higher dimensional accuracy and compressive yield stress, as well as minimal post-processing and finishing techniques. Originality/value: The important process parameters were prioritized as follows: printing orientation, layer height, printing speed, nozzle temperature and bed temperature. However, the number of shells was insignificant to the compressive property and dimensional accuracy. Nozzle temperature, bed temperature and number of shells were three significant process parameters effects on the dimensional accuracy, while layer height, printing speed and nozzle temperature were three important process parameters influencing compressive yield stress. The specimen fabricated in horizontal orientation supported higher compressive yield stress with wide processing ranges of nozzle and bed temperatures comparing to the vertical orientation with limited ranges. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS);

However, they suffer from deep-rooted multiscale defects including microstructural heterogeneity caused by the complex thermo-mechanical transients in the melt pool. Here we manufacture meta-crystal 316L stainless steel microlattice structures for utilizing the strain localization mechanism in bulk structures akin to dislocation slip mediated plasticity. These lattices are characterized here using scanning and transmission electron microscopy, along with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) to reveal the microstructural, chemical and crystallographic orientation information at various locations in the struts and joints. The presence of inherent voids was the major drawback that would undermine their structural performance as mechanical metamaterials. Nevertheless, other defects in the form of spatially correlated dislocation networks and micro-segregated cellular substructures overcome the strength-ductility trade-off and render the bulk structures comparable to other engineering materials including conventional steels. By exploiting this intrinsic strengthening mechanism due to the rapid (i.e. non-equilibrium) solidification phenomenon, the bond (i.e. strut) strength of meta-crystals can be enhanced (or controlled) on top of employing hardening principles of metallurgy to design architected materials with tailored properties. © 2020 The Authors","Architected materials; Atomic bond strength; Mechanical metamaterials; Meta-crystal; Powder bed fusion","3D printers; Additives; Complex networks; Defects; Economic and social effects; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Plasticity; Scanning electron microscopy; Solidification; Struts; Crystallographic orientations; Electron back scatter diffraction; Energy dispersive spectroscopies (EDS); Manufacturing techniques; Microstructural heterogeneity; Non-equilibrium solidification; Scanning and transmission electron microscopy; Strengthening mechanisms; Bond strength (materials)","","","","","","","Zheng X., Smith W., Jackson J., Moran B., Cui H., Chen D., Ye J., Fang N., Rodriguez N., Weisgraber T., Spadaccini C.M., Multiscale metallic metamaterials, Nat.

This technology is also beneficial in the jewelry industry, where precious metals are used, and the design and price are determinative factors. In this paper, the metal 3D printing process for jewelry production is discussed. Four rings made of gold, silver, titanium, and stainless-steel 316L have been designed and fabricated by AM machine based on the DMLS technique. Proper geometry and parameters for rings and support structure were determined. Results showed that a reduced amount of powder was required for 3D printing of metal rings using a locally developed AM machine. Besides, appropriate geometry and parameters for a jewelry box with a complex design have been specified to be fabricated from stainless steel 316L by the same AM machine. The quality of the final produced parts using DMLS technology was not demonstrated inferior compared to the quality of parts built by conventional manufacturing methods. Furthermore, utilizing an electron microscope the microstructures of the fabricated parts were obtained and analyzed in detail before and after polishing on the polisher machine. Results revealed that the maximum homogeneous surface was obtained for the gold and titanium samples, while the surface of the samples of stainless steel and silver had internal cavities, pores, and other defects. Also, it was concluded that usage of gold and silver for the manufacturing of jewelry product that does not experience heavy loads is quite justified.  © 2013 IEEE.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing (AM); direct metal laser sintering (DMLS); jewelry design; microstructure analysis; precious metals","Additives; Austenitic stainless steel; Fabrication; Gold; Laser heating; Microstructure; Selective laser melting; Silver; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Additive manufacturing; Application process; Direct metal laser sintering; Jewelry design; Manufacturing machine; Microstructures analysis; Stainless steel (316L); Sintering","","","","","","","Albarnawi A.A., Bashir M.O., Additive manufacturing: A new industrial revolution A review, J.

Tubes, with a wall thickness of 500 μm, were made of 316L stainless steel using selective laser melting. Its surface roughness, constituting phases, underlying microstructures and chemical composition were analyzed. The dependence of hardness and elastic modulus on the crystallographic orientation were investigated using electron backscatter diffraction and nanoindentation. Spherical nanoindentation was performed to extract the indentation stress–strain curve from the load–displacement data. The obtained results were compared with those for a commercial 316L stainless steel stent. Both tube and commercial stent samples were fully austenitic, and the as-fabricated surface finish for the tube was much rougher than the stent. Microstructural characterization revealed that the tube had a columnar and coarse grain microstructure, compared to equiaxed grains in the commercial stent. Berkovich nanoindentation suggested an effect for the grain orientation on the hardness and Young’s modulus. The stress–strain curves and the indentation yield strength for the tube and stent were similar. The work is an important step toward AM of patient-specific stents. © 2020, The Author(s).","additive manufacturing; material microstructure; mechanical properties; metallic stents; nanoindentation; selective laser melting","Austenitic stainless steel; Chemical analysis; Hardness; Indentation; Melting; Nanoindentation; Stents; Surface roughness; Textures; Thin walled structures; Tubes (components); 316 L stainless steel; Berkovich nanoindentation; Chemical compositions; Crystallographic orientations; Electron back scatter diffraction; Hardness and elastic modulus; Mechanical characterizations; Micro-structural characterization; Selective laser melting","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/R001650/1); Loughborough University, Lboro","Funding text 1: We acknowledge the support from the EPSRC UK (Grant Number: EP/R001650/1; Title: Smart peripheral stents for the lower extremity–design, manufacturing and evaluation).

The layer thickness is controlled to trading off between part accuracy and fabrication time. Several adaptive slicing approaches have been proposed to reduce the printing time while improving the accuracy. In this paper, a novel adaptive slicing algorithm based on slice contour reconstruction is presented. This approach can be adapted for standard additive manufacturing machines because it does not rely upon using multiple distinct values of layer thickness along the build direction. A simple geometric engine allows our approach to be adapted to existing machines. Our contour reconstruction algorithm, based on Medial axis computation, leads to 30%-50% reduction on volumetric deviation and distance deviation between the original part surface and the deposited part surface. Alternatively, for a given user-specified tolerance, our approach allows increases of layer thickness by over 20%, result-ing is commensurate savings in build-time. © 2021 CAD Solutions, LLC.","3D printing; Dimensional tolerance; Medial axis; Voronoi diagram DOI: https://doi.org","Layered manufacturing; Adaptive slicing; Build direction; Contour reconstruction; Fabrication time; Geometric engines; Layer thickness; Manufacturing process; Part surface; 3D printers","","","","","MAE; RGC, (16213519); Departments of IEDA","This research was supported in part by RGC GRF grant 16213519 and the Departments of IEDA, and MAE in HKUST.","Aichholzer O., Aigner W., Aurenhammer F., Hackl T., Jttler B., Rabl M., Medial axis computation for planar freeform shapes, Computer-Aided Design, 41, 5, pp. 339-349, (2009); Aichholzer O., Alberts D., Aurenhammer F., Grtner B., Straight skeletons of simple polygons, Proc. 4th Internat.

The local temperature field, which varies with location and time, plays a vital role in affecting the microstructure and mechanical properties of the final product. This study develops a robust numerical model based on finite element analysis (FEA) to determine the temperature field in an accurate and reliable way. Taking a titanium alloy as an example, the melt pool geometry is used to select the best heat source model and key thermal parameters. Temperature measurements underneath the melt pool using thermocouples are employed to quantify the location-dependent heat convection model by comparing the thermal history. Some strategies for further refinement of this numerical model are also discussed in this paper. This improved numerical model is expected to provide a solid ground to support reliable simulation of microstructure and mechanical properties for the LMD process. © 2021 Engineers Australia.","finite element analysis; Laser metal deposition; melt pool simulation; temperature field simulation; thermocouple measurement","Deposition; Heat convection; Lakes; Metals; Microstructure; Numerical models; Reliability analysis; Temperature; Temperature measurement; Thermocouples; Titanium alloys; Additive manufacturing process; Finite element analyse; Laser metal deposition; Major metal; Melt pool; Melt pool simulation; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Temperature field simulation; Thermal history; Thermocouple measurements; Finite element method","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP180103205)","This research work was supported by the Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Projects [DP180103205].

However, when the Hastelloy-X material was employed, solidification crack occurred during the SLM process. This cracking can be reduced or eliminated by optimizing the process parameters, such as the laser power and scan speed, although the optimization is time- and cost-intensive. In this study, we evaluated the possibility of exploring the change in the plastic strain, obtained by thermal elastoplastic analysis, during the solidification process, as an indicator of the occurrence of solidification cracking. The experimental observations of solidification cracking in the single-track formation tests for various laser conditions, and the degree of change in the plastic strain during the solidification process obtained by the thermal elastoplastic analysis, were compared. The single-track formation part was the foundational part of the parts made by SLM process. There was a clear correlation between the maximum change in the plastic strain in the melted area and the existence of solidification cracking. The maximum change in the plastic strain was less than 0.0041 when no crack was found, whereas it was in the range larger than 0.0048 when the cracks were observed. These results indicated the possibility of assessing the occurrence of solidification cracking, in terms of the maximum change in the plastic strain in the melted area. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Hastelloy-X; Plastic strain; Selective laser melting; Solidification cracking; Thermal elastoplastic analysis","Elastoplasticity; Melting; Plastic deformation; Selective laser melting; Solidification; Degree of change; Laser conditions; Process parameters; Selective laser melting (SLM); Solidification cracking; Solidification cracks; Solidification process; Thermal elasto-plastic; Laser materials processing","","","","","Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program; Swine Innovation Porc, SIP; Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST; Council for Science, Technology and Innovation, CSTI","Funding text 1: This work was supported by Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (CSTI), Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP), “’Materials Integration’ for revolutionary design system of structural materials” (Funding agency: JST). ; Funding text 2: Financial support from Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (CSTI), Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP), “ Materials Integration’ for revolutionary design system of structural materials ” (Funding agency: JST) is gratefully acknowledged.","(1997); Matsukawa C., Hayashi S., Yakuwa H., Kishikawa T., Narita T., Ukai S., High-temperature carburization behaviour of HASTELLOY X in CH4 gas, Corros.

Short carbon fibre T300 reinforced nylon-6 composite is selected as the printing material. X-ray micro-tomography (µCT) scans are performed on the raw filament, in-nozzle melted filament, extruded printing bead and on-bed printing bead to trace the through-process evolution of fibres and voids for the specific nozzle used therein. Qualitative visualisation of voids fraction and fibre orientation, length and fraction, as well as quantitative analysis are carried out using image processing techniques. The results show that the orientation and volume fraction of fibres vary with different internal geometry of the nozzle and fibre misalignment occurs in the on-bed printing bead because the relative motion between the nozzle and the print bed disturbs the flow field. Also the fibre length decreases slightly during the printing process due to the collision between fibre and nozzle wall when the melted materials pass the nozzle. For the void volume fraction, most voids are generated when the melted filament is extruded from the nozzle, and porosity decreases in the on-bed printing bead. The reported experimental data of through-process evolution of fibre flow and void formation can also be used for benchmarking and/or validating computational models for 3D printing of short fibre reinforced polymer composites. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Carbon fibre reinforced thermoplastic (CFRTP); Fibre orientation; Fused filament fabrication (FFF); Void formation; X-ray µCT","Computerized tomography; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Graphite fibers; Rocket nozzles; Thermoplastics; Void fraction; Volume fraction; Computational model; Experimental benchmarks; Fibre misalignment; Image processing technique; Printing materials; Short carbon fibres; Void volume fraction; X-ray micro tomographies; 3D printers","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/P017169/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; Royal Society, (IEC/NSFC/170418); Royal Society","The lead author would like to acknowledge Royal Society ( IEC/NSFC/170418 ) and EPSRC ( EP/P017169/1 ) for financial support of this study.","Ning F., Cong W., Hu Y., Wang H., Additive manufacturing of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composites using fused deposition modeling: effects of process parameters on tensile properties, J.

There is little understanding of the causes of these defects. The motivation of this research was to explain why the un-melted particles and cracks were always present at the materials' interface when using laser-based powder bed fusion (PBF-LB) to process powder mixtures composed of two materials with significant different thermo-physical properties. In this study, the influence of laser volume energy density (VED) and material composition ratio on the melting status of laser-processed powder layers was investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Experimental results show that VED, sufficient to melt the high melting point Invar36 alone, is insufficient to melt the Invar36/Cu10Sn mixture. This phenomenon is because Cu10Sn copper alloy has lower laser beam absorptivity, higher thermal conductivity and lower melting temperature. When the Cu10Sn powder partially covers the surface of a powder layer, the laser energy absorption is reduced. Its high thermal conductivity causes heat to dissipate more quickly. These two factors make it difficult for Invar36 located below Cu10Sn to reach its melting point. Computational fluid dynamic and discrete element method simulation is conducted to understand this phenomenon, and it shows that increasing VED can improve the melting of the Invar36/Cu10Sn powder mixture. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Bimetallic material; Cu10Sn; Functionally graded material; Invar36; Laser volume energy density; Laser-based powder bed fusion","3D printers; Additives; Beams and girders; Binary alloys; Computational fluid dynamics; Copper alloys; Cracks; Dissimilar materials; Functionally graded materials; Interfaces (materials); Laser beams; Melting point; Mixtures; Thermal conductivity of solids; Tin alloys; Bi-metallic components; Discrete element method simulations; Functionally graded material (FGM); High thermal conductivity; Laser energy absorption; Material compositions; Thermo-physical property; Volume energy density; Laser materials processing","","","","","University of Manchester","The University of Manchester is gratefully acknowledged for their PhD scholarships awarded to Chao Wei and Yuan-hui Chueh.","Tey C.F., Tan X., Sing S.L., Yeong W.Y., Additive manufacturing of multiple materials by selective laser melting: Ti- alloy to stainless steel via a Cu-alloy interlayer, Addit.

The objective was to determine the range of optimal SLM parameters to provide a stable track with a depth of two to three layers. Single tracks were built using various combinations of process parameters: laser power from 50 to 400 W with a step of 30 W and scanning speed from 450 to 1000 mm/sec with a step of 50 mm/sec (144 modes in total). An Axiovert 200M MAT light microscope (Carl Zeiss) was employed to examine the cross sections of single tracks and evaluate the geometrical parameters of the melt pools. Features pertaining to the effect of the scanning speed and laser power on single-track depth and width and their ratio were experimentally studied. An unstable track formed at low power (P = 50 W) and low scanning speed (V = 450–500 mm/sec), while no track appeared at all at higher speeds. A stable track formed at power P = 80–200 W at low speeds (V = 500–900 mm/sec) and became unstable and intermittent when speed increased to V = 1000 mm/sec. With higher laser power (P = 230–400 W) and low process speeds, a continuous track formed but had an increased variable width, being indicative of a deviation from the stable track formation conditions. It was first established that the intensity of the scanning speed effect (450–1000 mm/sec) on the single track depth varies by more than 2.5 times depending on the laser power (50–400 W). The process parameters that would ensure the formation of an optimal single track in terms of geometric parameters were determined. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Inconel 718; melt pool geometry; optimum conditions; selective laser melting; single track","Geometry; Lakes; Light modulators; Melting; Nickel alloys; Scanning; Speed; Heat resistant; Process parameters; Process speed; Scanning speed; Selective laser melting (SLM); Single-tracks; Track formation; Variable width; Selective laser melting","","","","","","","Sharman A.R.C., Amarasinghe A., Ridgway K., Tool life and surface integrity aspects when drilling and hole making in Inconel 718, J.

This approach aims to combine high mechanical properties of the metallic structure with enhanced biological activity. 316L stainless steel (316L-SS) lattice structures were fabricated using selective laser melting. Despite its good mechanical properties, 316L-SS lacks the biofunctionality required to achieve long-term implantation. To be successfully used as biomaterial, these porous 3D lattice structures were thus coated by 58S bioglass through a simple impregnation method. The use of a silica layer was evaluated as possible pretreatment to improve bioglass adhesion. The coated parts are then assessed by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive spectrometry to qualify the coating. Porous sample parts pretreated with a silica layer presented a denser coating structure when compared with untreated porous metallic structures. The bioactivity in SBF medium shows the formation of a uniform apatite layer after 7 days of immersion, producing the bioregeneration capability. This latter, combined with the lightweight framework structure provided by 316-SS, will increase the lifetime of this new generation of orthopedic implants. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","","Bioactive glass;

The present study investigates infill percentage and infill pattern effects on the printed parts’ impact properties through the 3D printing technique using coconut wood-filled PLA composites. Mathematical models are also proposed in the present study with the aim for future property prediction. According to the ASTM standard, fifteen specimens with different parameter combinations were printed using a low-cost FDM 3D printer to evaluate their impact properties. Statistical analysis was performed using MINITAB to validate the experimental data and model development. The experimental outcomes reveal the honeycomb pattern with 75% infill density achieves the highest energy absorption (0.837 J) and impact energy (5.1894 kJ/m2). The p-value from statistical analysis clearly shows that all the impact properties are less than the alpha value of 0.05, suggesting all the properties are vital to determine the impact properties. The validation process affirms that the generated mathematical model for the energy absorbed and the impact energy is reliable at an acceptable level to predict their respective properties. The errors between the experimental value and the predicted value are 3.98% for the energy absorbed and 4.06% for impact energy. The findings are expected to provide insights on the impact behavior of the coconut wood-filled PLA composites prepared by FDM-3D printing and a mathematical model to predict the impact properties. © 2021, Tech Science Press.

IV 46-147F Los Angeles, 90095, CA, United States","We introduce two essential building blocks with binary stiffness for mechanical digital machines. The large scale fully compliant mechanisms have rectilinear and rotational kinematics and use a new V-shaped negative stiffness structure to create two extreme states of stiffness by static balancing. The use of a mechanical bistable switch allows us to toggle between near-zero-stiffness and high-stiffness states, effectively turning off and on stiffness. A stiffness reduction of 98.8% and 99.9% is achieved for linear and rotary motion over a range of 13.3% (20mm) and 0.4rad (23∘) respectively. Stiffness states can be reversibly changed by toggling the mechanical switch, or irreversibly by actuating the main stage. These binary stiffness mechanisms could set the stage for a new type of mechanical logic, adaptive and programmable metamaterials and other types of digital mechanical devices. Practical mechanical digital machines and materials require miniaturized and easily micro-manufactured components. We have therefore carefully considered scalability by integrating all required structures into a planar and monolithic architecture. This allows miniaturization and fabrication with conventional surface-micro-machining and additive manufacturing such as photolithography, two-photon lithography and fused deposition modeling. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Digital mechanism; Mechanical logic; Metamaterials; Static balancing; Zero stiffness","Digital devices; Fused Deposition Modeling; Mechanisms; Stiffness; Surface micromachining; Bistable switches; Fully compliant mechanism; Monolithic architecture; Negative stiffness; Programmable metamaterials; Rotational kinematics; Stiffness reduction; Two-photon lithography; Balancing","","","","","La Chaux de Fonds; TAG Heuer Institute","This research is conducted at the instigation of and with close collaboration with TAG Heuer Institute, La Chaux de Fonds, 2300 Switzerland, and its Director, Mr G.A.(Guy) Sémon, and received funding from TAG Heuer Institute, Switzerland .","de Laat M.L.C., Garza H.H.P., Herder J.L., Ghatkesar M.K., A review on in situ stiffness adjustment methods in mems, J.

This study is to point out the relationship between the microstructure, mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of CoCr alloys prepared by SLM after porcelain sintering process. In addition, the biosafety of the sintered CoCr alloy was evaluated. Design/methodology/approach: The microscopic feature changes of CoCr alloy samples after porcelain sintering process were observed by DMI 5000 M inverted metallographic microscope and Nova Nano430 FE-SEM. Moreover, phase identification and determination were conducted by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Smartlab X-ray diffractometer. The Vickers microhardness was measured on the HVS-30 microhardness tester, and tensile tests were carried out on a CM3505 electronic universal testing machine. The corrosion resistance was tested by a classical three-point electrode system electrochemical method, then the ion precipitation was measured by using an atomic absorption spectrometer of Z2000 7JQ8024. Findings: The XRD results indicate that the transition of γ phase (FCC) to e phase (HCP) occurs during the porcelain sintering processing of CoCr alloy. Moreover, the Vickers microhardness of the upper surface and the side surface of the CoCr alloy sample was improved by more than 36%. In addition, the ultimate strength of CoCr alloy via porcelain sintering treatment was increase to 1,395.3 ± 53.0 MPa compared to 1,282.7 ± 10.1 MPa of unprocessed CoCr alloy. However, the corrosion resistance of CoCr alloy samples decreases after porcelain sintering process. Originality/value: There are few studies on the relationship of microstructure, mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of CoCr alloys prepared by SLM after porcelain sintering process. In this study, the microstructure, mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of CoCr alloy after porcelain sintering process were studied, and the biosafety of the alloy was evaluated. The research found that it is feasible to apply CoCr alloy fabricated by SLM to dental medicine after porcelain sintering process. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","CoCr alloy; Corrosion resistance; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Selective laser melting","Binary alloys; Biohazards; Chromium alloys; Chromium metallography; Cobalt metallography; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant alloys; Dental alloys; Melting; Microhardness; Microstructure; Porcelain; Selective laser melting; Selective laser sintering; Sintering; Tensile testing; Uranium alloys; Uranium metallography; X ray diffraction; Atomic absorption spectrometers; Design/methodology/approach; ELectrochemical methods; Metallographic microscope; Selective laser melting (SLM); Universal testing machines; Vickers microhardness; X ray diffractometers; Cobalt alloys","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, (51705160, 51775196, 51875215); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2018ZD30, D2192090); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, (2017A030313271, 2017B090911014); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province","The work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, Nos. 51875215, 51775196 and 51705160), the Guangdong Province Science and Technology Project (2017B090911014, 2017A030313271) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities Project (2018ZD30, D2192090).","Bai Y., Yang Y., Xiao Z., Zhang M., Wang D., Process optimization and mechanical property evolution of AlSiMg<sub>0.75</sub> by selective laser melting, Materials & Design, 140, pp. 257-266, (2018); Bellezze T., Giuliani G., Roventi G., Study of stainless steels corrosion in a strong acid mixture.

Highly uniform thickness of microfibers (CV < 5%) is also achievable in various sizes by our proposed method in ranges of 25–30 μm and 75–130 μm. For the thickness control and the uniformity of the thickness, we investigate three main printing control factors (filament extrusion volume, printing speed, and gaps between printing nozzle and printing bed) through experiment. The observation from the experiment concludes that the filament extrusion volume is the most dominant factor to rule the thickness of the suspended polymer microfiber, and the printing speed is the following determinant factor. The uniformity of the thickness is maintained with a lower extrusion volume and a higher printing speed, and it is concluded that such a printing setting makes microfibers thinner due to smaller viscoelastic internal compressing force along the microfiber. Additionally, we analyze a relation of the three printing parameters to estimate the thickness of the microfiber by FDM 3D printing. © 2020 CIRP","3D printing; Filament elongation; Liquid bridge; Microfiber;

Until now, lots of methods have emerged and used in this field with diverse characteristics. This review aims to comprehensively discuss 3D printing (3DP) technologies to manufacture metallic implants, especially on techniques and procedures. Various technologies based on their main properties are categorized, the effecting parameters are introduced, and the history of AM technology is briefly analyzed. Subsequently, the utilization of these AM-manufactured components in medicine along with their effectual variables is discussed, and special attention is paid on to the production of porous scaffolds, taking pore size, density, etc., into consideration. Finally, 3DP of the popular metallic systems in medical applications such as titanium, Ti6Al4V, cobalt-chromium alloys, and shape memory alloys are studied. In general, AM manufactured implants need to comply with important requirements such as biocompatibility, suitable mechanical properties (strength and elastic modulus), surface conditions, custom-built designs, fast production, etc. This review aims to introduce the AM technologies in implant applications and find new ways to design more sophisticated methods and compatible implants that mimic the desired tissue functions. © This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), permitting all non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.","3D printing techniques; Additive manufacturing; Biometals; Implants; Porous scaffolds","","","","","","Medical Engineering Cross Research Foundation of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, (YG2019QNA46); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (31971246, 51831011); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 31971246 and no. 51831011) and Medical Engineering Cross Research Foundation of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (no.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposes a curved-layered material extrusion modeling process with a five-axis motion mechanism. This process has advantages of the platform rotating, non-support printing and three-dimensional printing path. First, the authors present a curved-layered algorithm by offsetting the bottom surface into a series of conformal surfaces and a toolpath generation algorithm based on the geodesic distance field in each conformal surface. Second, they introduce a parallel five-axis printing machine consisting of a printing head fixed on a delta-type manipulator and a rotary platform on a spherical parallel machine. Findings: Mechanical experiments show the failure force of the five-axis printed samples is 153% higher than that of the three-axis printed samples. Forming experiments show that the surface roughness significantly decreases from 42.09 to 18.31 µm, and in addition, the material consumption reduces by 42.90%. These data indicate the curved-layered algorithm and five-axis motion mechanism in this paper could effectively improve mechanical properties and the surface roughness of thin-walled parts, and realize non-support printing. These methods also have reference value for other additive manufacturing processes. Originality/value: Previous researchers mostly focus on printing simple shapes such as arch or “T”-like shape. In contrast, this study sets out to explore the algorithm and benefits of modeling thin-walled parts by a five-axis machine. Several validated models would allow comparability in five-axis printing. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing; Curved-layered manufacturing algorithm; Five-axis machine; Material extrusion modeling","Additives;

Currently, Graphene is gaining remarkable attention, as a filler material, used for the reinforcement of metal and polymer composites. In this paper, the 3D printing system, based on the digital light processing (DLP) method, is employed for the fabrication of bio-based resin specimens, to estimate their dynamic mechanical properties. For this purpose, two graphene concentrations (0.5 and 1 wt%) were mixed in resin (matrix) by a vortex mixer/shaker. The resultant mixture, in addition to the neat resin, was utilized for producing the test pieces, at three different layer thicknesses (35, 50, 100 µm). A comparison of the mechanical properties, between the DLP-printed neat resin and graphene/resin composite materials, was accomplished, to illustrate the impact of filler (graphene nanoplatelets) and the printing process settings (layer thickness). These determinants were assessed according to the microstructure and tensile characteristics of the examined materials. The results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed a fairly even dispersion of graphene in the resin matrix. Moreover, it was found that smaller layer thicknesses provide a higher tensile strength. Further, a decrease in Young's modulus, tensile strength and elongation can be observed, with higher graphene concentrations. © 2021, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

Among AM processes, PBF yields excellent dimensional accuracy, and the built parts can be applied to molding dies and topology-optimized parts. Furthermore, PBF can be used to build porous structures. In this study, a highly functional die casting method was established using PBF, which involved a release agent supplied through the porous structure to the surface of the proposed die. The arrangement of the porous structure made it possible to apply the release agent to the deep groove, which is not possible using a spray as in conventional supply methods. The laser-irradiated area was visual-ized to confirm pore formation, and the building conditions of the porous structure suitable to supply the release agent were investigated. The resulting die casting characteristics were evaluated. Considering the obtained results, guidelines to build dies or molds for die casting with porous structures are recommended. The amount of release agent could be controlled at each position of the die casting die, and the melted Al alloy did not penetrate the porous structure. In addi-tion, the obtained Al alloy casting did not exhibit any castability defects. Moreover, suitable control of the supply of the release agent enabled enhancement of the die casting characteristics. © Fuji Technology Press Ltd.","Additive manufacturing; Die casting; Porous structure; Powder bed fusion; Release agent","3D printers; Aluminum alloys; Die casting; Dies; Laser beams; Powder metals; Substrates; Additive manufacturing process; Al-alloy; Casting characteristics; Dimensional accuracy; Laser beam irradiation; Molding dies; Porous structures; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion; Release agent; Porosity","","","","","Yamaguchi Giken Co., Ltd.; Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, METI, (JPJ005698)","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the METI Monozukuri R&D Sup-port Grant Program for SMEs Grant Number JPJ005698.

This paper presents a flexible and effective thermal multi-phase flow model for directed energy deposition (DED) processes. Departing from the data-fitted or presumed deposit shapes in the literature, we first derive a deposit geometry model based on an energy minimization problem with a mass conservation constraint. Then, an interface-capturing approach based on a signed distance function that moves with the laser is constructed to represent the air–metal interface evolution. The approach can be applied to any type of mesh without requiring the activation process of solid elements in a mesh. The coupled multi-phase Navier–Stokes and energy conservation equations are solved by a variational multi-scale formulation (VMS). A density-scaled continuous surface force (CSF) model is employed to incorporate the Marangoni effect, no penetration boundary condition, and the heat source on the air–metal interface. We utilize the proposed method to simulate two representative metal manufacturing problems. The simulated results are carefully compared with available experimental measurements and computational results from others. The results demonstrate the accuracy and modeling capabilities of the proposed method for metal AM problems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Directed energy deposition; Thermal multi-phase flow; Variational multi-scale formulation","3D printers; Deposits; Mesh generation; Multiphase flow; Navier Stokes equations; Computational results; Efficient simulation; Energy conservation equations; Energy minimization problem; Indispensable tools; Metal manufacturing; Multi-phase flow models; Signed distance function; Metals","","","","","Texas Advanced Computing Center, (CTS20014)","The research is partially supported by the ASME Robert M. and Mary Haythornthwaite Research Initiation Award, United States of America and Singapore National Research Foundation, Singapore (NRF2018-ITS004-0011).

This study utilized synchrotron-based x-ray computed tomography and an in situ high-speed imaging technique, dynamic x-ray radiography (DXR), to investigate the formation of powder-induced porosity using 17-4 PH stainless steel powders with a controlled size distribution and intentionally varied entrapped gas contents. While powder with a low entrapped gas content showed no net part porosity increase, the results showed a strong correlation between the porosity in the powder and the porosity in the builds made from powder with a high entrapped gas content relative to typical gas-atomized powder. A threshold value was developed to classify porosity induced by powder-entrapped gas based on pore morphology measured using computed tomography. Transfer and coalescence of pores during laser melting was observed directly with DXR. © 2020, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.","","3D printers; Computerized tomography; Fabrication; Gases; Porosity; Stainless steel; Steel powder metallurgy; X ray radiography; X rays; 17-4 PH stainless steel; Controlled size; Gas entrapments; Gas-atomized powders; High speed imaging; Pore morphology; Strong correlation; X-ray computed tomography; Powder metals","","","","","Carpenter Technology Corporation; US Department of Energy; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; Argonne National Laboratory, ANL, (DE-AC02-06CH11357); Argonne National Laboratory, ANL; Carnegie Mellon University, CMU","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the support of the NextManufacturing Center at Carnegie Mellon University.

Their microstructure, composition, spatial morphology, and mechanical behaviors were systematically investigated. These areas consisted of finer columnar dendrites with underdeveloped secondary arms, which resulted in a bright color under optical field and dark color under SEM. Both growth and crystal orientations were consistent with those of the grains in the melt pool of the former layer. Enrichment of elements Nb and Ti occurred among the dendrites in these areas, leading to the formation of Laves phases. The crescent areas underwent great deformation together with the melt pools during tensile testing, which showed that they were of great plasticity and no gaps or cracks were found around these areas. In addition, the bright crescent areas possessed higher hardness than that of the surrounding regions. Furthermore, the simulated temperature field results showed that the incomplete re-melting of the formed dendrites and a large number of nucleated dendrites among them are the main reasons for the formation of the bright crescent areas. © 2020 Tsinghua University","Inconel 718; Mechanical behavior; Melt pool; Microstructure; Selective laser melting","Crystal orientation; Dendrites (metallography); Lakes; Light modulators; Melting; Morphology; Plasticity testing; Tensile testing; Columnar dendrites; Dark colors; Laves phasis; Mechanical behavior; Optical field; Selective laser melting (SLM); Spatial morphologies; Surrounding regions; Selective laser melting","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology of China; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST, (2016YFB1100703); Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST","Funding text 1: The project was funded by the National Science and Technology Major Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (Grant No. 2016YFB1100703 ).; Funding text 2: The project was funded by the National Science and Technology Major Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (Grant No. 2016YFB1100703).","Deng D.Y., Peng R.L., Brodin H., Moverare J., Microstructure and mechanical properties of Inconel 718 produced by selective laser melting: sample orientation dependence and effects of post heat treatments, Mater.

However, the complex consolidation mechanism of powder and the different material behavior after the first laser melting hinder the direct implementation of the re-melting process. In this work, the effects of re-melting on the temperature and residual stress evolution in the SLM process are investigated using a thermo-mechanically coupled finite element model. The degree of consolidation is incorporated in the energy balance equation based on the thermodynamically-consistent phase-field approach. The drastic change of material properties due to the variation of temperature and material state is also considered. Using the proposed simulation framework, the single-track scanning is simulated first to predict the melt pool dimension and validate the proposed model with the existing experimental data. The obtained thermal histories reveal that the highest cooling rate is observed at the end of the local solidification time which acts as an important indicator for the alleviation of temperature gradient. Then, the scanning of a whole single layer that consists of multiple tracks is simulated to observe the stress evolution with several re-melting processes. After the full melting of powder material in the first scanning process, the increase of residual stress level is observed with one remelting cycle. Moreover, the predicted stress level with the re-melting process shows the variation trend attributable to the accumulated heat in the tracks. The numerical issues and the detailed implementation process are also introduced in this paper. © 2020 Tech Science Press.

Detailed descriptions of the measurement process, results, and approaches to determining uncertainties are provided. Measurement uncertainties have complex dependencies on multiple process parameters, so the methodology is demonstrated on one set of process parameters and one material. Well-established literature values for high-purity nickel solidification temperature and emissivity at the solidification temperature were used to evaluate the predicted uncertainty of the measurements. The standard temperature measurement uncertainty is found to be approximately 0.9 % of the absolute temperature (16 °C), and the standard relative emissivity measurement uncertainty is found to be approximately 8 % at the solidification point of high-purity nickel, both of which are satisfactory. This paper also outlines several potential sources of test uncertainties, which may require additional experimental evaluation. The largest of these are the metal vapor and ejecta that are produced as process by-products, which can potentially affect the imaging quality, reflectometry results, and thermal signature of the process, while also affecting the process of laser power delivery. Furthermore, the current paper focuses strictly on the uncertainties of the emissivity and temperature measurement approach and therefore does not detail a variety of uncertainties associated with experimental controls that must be evaluated for future generation of reference data. © 2021 National Institute of Standards and Technology.

This paper applies the cutting-edge three-dimensional printing (3DP) technique into the fabrication of ROC and the visualized two-phase fluids experiments. The structure of 3D-printed ROC is quantitatively characterized using the surface scanning analyzer and stereomicroscope, and then validated by comparison with the original digital structure. Then immiscible (oil-water) two-phase flow experiments are conducted on the 3D-printed ROC and imaged using the high-resolution camera in real time. The typical fingering phenomenon caused by the heterogeneity of pore-throat structure is observed, and the effects of surface wettability on the interfacial shape evolution are analyzed. Comparing to traditional fabrication methods (e.g., chemical etching and soft lithography), 3D-printed ROC is approved to be a novel approach to manufacture the morphology, topology, and connectivity of the pore network, while reducing the cost and the time required. © 2021 by Begell House, Inc.","3D printing; Pore-scale flow; ROC; Waterflooding; Wettability","3D printers; Etching; Fabrication; Morphology; Two phase flow; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Experiment validations; Flow experiments; Pore scale; Pore-scale flow; Porous flow; Reservoir-on-a-chip; Structure characterization; Subsurface fluid flow; Wetting","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41672342, 51909225); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, KAUST, (BAS/1/1351-1301); King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, KAUST; Southwest University of Science and Technology, SWUST, (20zx7129); Southwest University of Science and Technology, SWUST; China Scholarship Council, CSC","This paper is financially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of SWUST (Grant No. 20zx7129); the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51909225, 41672342); King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) (Grant No. BAS/1/1351-1301); and financial support from the China Scholarship Council.","Aadland R.C., Akarri S., Heggset E.B., Syverud K., Torster O., A Core Flood and Microfluidics Investigation of Nanocellulose as a Chemical Additive to Water Flooding for EOR, Nanomaterials, 10, 7, (2020); Al-Mukhtar M., Khattab S., Alcover J.F., Microstructure and Geotechnical Properties of Lime-Treated Expansive Clayey Soil, Eng.

However, only limited control over the internal architecture can be achieved using conventional design methods. The architecture with porosity variation strategy mimicking natural bone is critical to gain favorable combination of mechanical and biological properties for orthopedic implants. In this regard, a topology optimization method with customized morphology and mechanical properties derived from the trabecular bone was proposed to design three-dimensional architectures with gradient porosity resembling the porous structure of bone. In particular, the elastic constants for the trabecular bone were better predicted when the bone volume fraction was supplemented with a three-dimensional structural parameter, i.e., degree of anisotropy. These constants were set as the optimization constrains for morphology control. Then the porous titanium structures were manufactured by selective laser melting technology (SLM). The physical characteristics, mechanical properties of the scaffolds were compared systematically. The experimental results revealed that the as-built samples with the proposed method lead to a good match of morphological accuracy and mechanical properties to that of the bone. It demonstrates that the proposed topology optimization method with controlled morphology and mechanical properties provides an efficient manner for the biomimetic design of orthopedic implants. © 2013 IEEE.","Additive manufacturing; mechanics control; morphology; topological design; trabecular bone","Biomimetic processes; Design; Mechanical properties; Morphology; Porosity; Scaffolds; Selective laser melting; Topology; Biological properties; Conventional design methods; Internal architecture; Morphology and mechanical properties; Physical characteristics; Three-dimensional architecture; Topology Optimization Method; Trabecular bone structures; Structural properties","","","","","Science and Technology Research Project of Education Department of Liaoning Province, (jyt-dldxfw202005); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (2020-KF-12-04, 81741137); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2020M670714); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant 81741137, in part by the Liaoning Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 2020-KF-12-04, in part by the Science and Technology Research Project of Education Department of Liaoning Province under Grant jyt-dldxfw202005, in part by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Project under Grant 2020M670714, and in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.","Tan J.H.K., Sing S.L., Yeong W.Y., Microstructure modelling for metallic additive manufacturing: A review, Virtual Phys.

However, as with any manufacturing process, monitoring and mastering the process is essential to satisfy the requirements. In AM, most of the defects considered are internal (mainly porosity or inclusions) and due to process capabilities, it is mainly a way to obtain a raw part. This paper focuses on evaluating internal defects in Inconel 718 parts obtained by a laser-based AM technology, i.e. Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF). Some defects can be explained by the interaction between the layering system and the powder bed in the layering stage (keyhole induced by a lack of powder), by non-well melted areas during the melting stage (porosity or keyhole), or by part distortions in the solidification and cooling stages (cracking, warpage, base plate separation,…). In this study, an algorithm is developed to build a 3D Voxel-based model of manufactured parts, based on defects detected on post-layering and post-melting pictures using an embedded visible camera. This model is also compared to a corresponding 3D model of the build that was achieved by X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) scan data, to check its relevance. © 2021 CAD Solutions, LLC,.","Additive manufacturing (AM); In-situ monitoring; Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF); X-ray Computed Tomography (CT)","3D modeling; Computerized tomography; Defects; Melting; Porosity; Three dimensional computer graphics; Conventional manufacturing; Defects detection; Embedded visions; Internal defects; Manufacturing process; Process capabilities; Voxel based modeling; X-ray computed tomography; 3D printers","","","","","","","Chua Zhong Yang, Ahn II Hyuk, Moon Seung Ki, Process monitoring and inspection systems in metal additive manufacturing: Status and applications, International Journal Of Precision Engineering And Manufacturing Green Technology, 4, 2, pp. 235-245, (2017); Everton Sarah K., Hirsch Mathias, Stravroulakis Petros, Leach Richard K., Clare Adam T., Review of in-situ process monitoring and in-situ metrology for metal additive manufacturing, Materials and Design, 95, pp. 431-445, (2016); Grasso Marco, Colosimo Bianca Maria, Process defects and in situ monitoring methods in metal powder bed fusion: a review, Measurement Science and Technology, 28, (2017); Scime Luke, Beuth Jack, Anomaly detection and classification in a laser powder bed additive manufacturing process using a trained computer vision algorithm, Additive Manufacturing, 19, pp. 114-126, (2018); Scime Luke, Beuth Jack, A multi-scale convolutional neural network for autonomous anomaly detection and classification in a laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing process, Additive Manufacturing, 24, pp. 273-286, (2018); Gobert Christian, Reutzel Edward W., Petrich Jan, Nassar Abdalla R., Phoha Shashi, Application of supervised machine learning for defect detection during metallic powder bed fusion additive manufacturing using high resolution imaging, Additive Manufacturing, 21, pp. 517-528, (2018); Abdelrahman Mostafa, Reutzel Edward W., Nassar Abdalla R., Starr Thomas L., Application of supervised machine learning for defect detection during metallic powder bed fusion additive manufacturing using high resolution imaging, Additive Manufacturing, 15, pp. 01-11, (2017); Gong Haijun, Nadimpalli Venkata Karthik, Rafi Khalid, Starr Thomas, Stucker Brent, Micro-ct evaluation of defects in ti-6al-4v parts fabricated by metal additive manufacturing, Technologies, 7, (2019); Qin Yuchu, Qi Qunfen, Scott Paul J, Jiang Xiangqian, Status, comparison, and future of the represen-tations of additive manufacturing data, Computer-Aided Design, 111, pp. 44-64, (2019); Malisano J.

However, little work has been done to understand how different processing temperatures and times might impact the mechanical properties at longer sintering times than are typical in laser sintering (LS) systems. Prior results with projection sintering have shown that heating for longer times (>1 s) improves part toughness compared to laser sintering. In this work, Large Area Projection Sintering (LAPS) is used to sinter entire layers of material simultaneously over the course of a few seconds with spatial control of layer temperature. This work evaluates the effect of time and temperature on the mechanical properties of parts sintered from PA 2202 (Polyamide 12) powder. Toughness is shown to increase significantly with longer sintering times (5–8 s) and higher temperatures (195–205 °C) with elongations at break (EaB) over 100% and strengths of up to 51.7 MPa. This represents a small increase in strength and an order of magnitude increase in elongation at break relative to LS datasheet values for the material. Peak mechanical properties are achieved sintering at lower temperature (195 °C) and longer times (5–8 s). The density of the samples that maximize toughness and strength is greater than 1.02 g/cm3 compared to datasheet values of 0.98 g/cm3. Porosity elimination could be a mechanism for improved performance though it does not fully explain the improvements in strength and ductility. © 2020","Laser sintering; Mechanical properties; Polyamide-12; Polymer sintering; Porosity; Powder bed fusion; Sintering","3D printers; Laser heating; Processing; Sintering; Area projection; Data-sheet values; Elongation at break; Laser sintering; Lower temperatures; Processing temperature; Spatial control; Strength and ductilities; Mechanical properties","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CMMI1851728)","This work is supported in part by the National Science Foundation of the United States through award CMMI1851728 .

This study aims to focus on investigating the effects of design choices offered by material extrusion AM – namely, the choice of infill pattern – on the structural performance and optimality of a given optimized topology. Elucidation of these effects provides evidence that using design tools that incorporate anisotropic behavior is necessary for designing truly optimal structures for manufacturing via AM. Design/methodology/approach: A benchmark topology optimization (TO) problem was solved for compliance minimization of a thick beam in three-point bending and the resulting geometry was printed using fused filament fabrication. The optimized geometry was printed using a variety of infill patterns and the strength, stiffness and failure behavior were analyzed and compared. The bending tests were accompanied by corresponding elastic finite element analyzes (FEA) in ABAQUS. The FEA used the material properties obtained during tensile and shear testing to define orthotropic composite plies and simulate individual printed layers in the physical specimens. Findings: Experiments showed that stiffness varied by as much as 22% and failure load varied by as much as 426% between structures printed with different infill patterns. The observed failure modes were also highly dependent on infill patterns with failure propagating along with printed interfaces for all infill patterns that were consistent between layers. Elastic FEA using orthotropic composite plies was found to accurately predict the stiffness of printed structures, but a simple maximum stress failure criterion was not sufficient to predict strength. Despite this, FE stress contours proved beneficial in identifying the locations of failure in printed structures. Originality/value: This study quantifies the effects of infill patterns in printed structures using a classic TO geometry. The results presented to establish a benchmark that can be used to guide the development of emerging manufacturing-oriented TO protocols that incorporate directionally-dependent, process-specific material properties. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Anisotropy; Finite element analysis; Topology optimization","3D printers; ABAQUS; Anisotropy; Bending dies; Bending tests; Composite structures; Extrusion; Geometry; Infill drilling; Stiffness; Structural design; Structural optimization; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Topology; Anisotropic behaviors; Compliance minimization; Design/methodology/approach; Mechanical anisotropy; Optimized geometries; Orthotropic composites; Strength and stiffness; Structural performance; Failure (mechanical)","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CMMI-1825815); National Science Foundation, NSF","This work is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant No. CMMI-1825815.

In this method, the near-net shape is manufactured through layer-by-layer weld-deposition on a substrate. However, as a result of this sequential weld-deposition, different layers are subjected to different types of thermal cycles and partial re-melting. The resulting microstructural evolution of the material may not be uniform. Hence, the purpose of this study is to assess microstructure variation along with the lamination direction (or build direction). Design/methodology/approach: The study was carried out for two different boundary conditions, namely, isolated condition and cooled condition. The microstructural evolution across the layers is hypothesized based on experimental assessment; this included microhardness, scanning electron microscopy imaging and electron backscatter diffraction analysis. These conditions subsequently collaborated with the help of thermal modeling of the process. Findings: During a new layer deposition, the previous layer also is subject to re-melt. While the newly added layer undergoes rapid cooling through a combination of convection, conduction and radiation losses, the penultimate layer, sees a slower cooling curve due to its smaller exposure area. This behavior of rapid-solidification and subsequent re-melting and re-solidification is a progressing phenomenon across the layers and the bulk of the layers have uniform grains due to this remelt-re-solidification phenomenon. Research limitations/implications: This paper studies the microstructure variation along with the build direction for thin-walled components fabricated through weld-deposition. This study would be helpful in addressing the issue of anisotropy resulting from the distinctive thermal history of each layer in the overall theme of metal additive manufacturing. Originality/value: The unique aspect of this paper is the postulation of a generic hypothesis, based on experimental findings and supported by thermal modeling of the process, for remelt-re-solidification phenomenon followed by temperature raising/lowering repetitively in every layer deposition across the layers. This is implemented for different types of base plate conditions, revealing the role of boundary conditions on the microstructure evolution. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Mechanical properties;

Over 80 geometric features for each cellular cell were extracted and statistically analyzed using machine learning techniques to explore the structure-property linkages of carbon nanotube reinforced AlSi10Mg nanocomposites. Predictive models for hardness and relative mass density were established using these subgrain cellular microstructural features. Data dimension reduction using principal component analysis was conducted to reduce the feature number to 3. The results showed that even AlSi10Mg nanocomposite specimens produced using different laser parameters exhibited similar Al-Si eutectic microstructures, displaying a large difference in their mechanical properties including hardness and relative mass density due to cellular structure variance. For hardness prediction, the Extra Tress regression models showed a relative error of 2.47% for prediction accuracies. For the relative mass density prediction, the Decision Tress regression models showed a relative error of 1.42% for prediction accuracies. The results demonstrate that the developed models deliver satisfactory performance for hardness and relative mass density prediction of AlSi10Mg nanocomposites. The framework established in this study can be applied to the LPBF process optimization and mechanical properties manipulation of AlSi10Mg-based alloys and other additive manufacturing newly designed alloys or composites.  © 2021 Tianyu Yu et al., published by De Gruyter.","additive manufacturing; AlSi10Mg; carbon nanotubes; laser powder bed fusion; machine learning","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Biomechanics; Density (specific gravity); Forecasting; Hardness; Machine learning; Matrix algebra; Microstructure; Nanocomposites; Neural networks; Optimization; Porosity; Principal component analysis; Regression analysis; Reinforcement; Scanning electron microscopy; Aluminium matrix; Cellulars; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Mass densities; Microstructural features; Powder bed; Regression modelling; Reinforced aluminum; Relative mass; Carbon nanotubes","","","","","Key Laboratory of High Performance Manufacturing for Aero Engine; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (SKLRS202002C); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Harbin Institute of Technology, HIT; Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China, MIIT; State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (AUGA5710050320); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","Funding information: This work was supported by Project 52005133 of National Natural Science Foundation of China, Self-Planned Task (No. SKLRS202002C) of State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System (HIT), Research Fund of Key Laboratory of High Performance Manufacturing for Aero Engine (Northwestern Polytechnical University), Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (Grant No.HPM-2020-08), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. AUGA5710050320).

A chromium-molybdenum-vanadium steel, AISI H13, was used as a metal powder. The relationship between the powder morphology, size distribution, and the powder-bed layer characteristics, such as the thermal conductivity and laser absorption under a N2 or Ar atmosphere, was determined. Subsequently, its effect on the built width, height, and contact angle was investigated by observing the cross-sectional profile of the structure. Finally, the powder morphology, size distribution, and characteristics were linked to the processability in SLM and were found to be closely related to the powder-bed layer characteristics, which affects the first deposition layer of the SLM H13 steel. The effect of the atmosphere on the contact angle is notable. The use of the Ar atmosphere to fabricate the continuous and stable structure at the minimum volume specific energy density (VSED) is reasonable because of its thermal property. The powder morphology, which depends on the atomization method, yields a variation in the bulk density and thermal property of the powder bed layer. The powder bed layer with the irregular powder can be influenced by the atmospheric characteristics because of its low bulk density. The effect of the powder-size distribution on the contact angle depends on the powder morphology. The spherical powder can perform the low-contact angle for a lower VSED. © 2021 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers","H13 steel; Particle size distribution; Powder morphology; Powder-bed layer characteristics; Selective laser melting","Argon lasers; Chromium steel; Contact angle; Melting; Molybdenum steel; Morphology; Selective laser melting; Size distribution; Thermal conductivity; Vanadium steel; Chromium molybdenum; Cross sectional profiles; Deposition layers; Powder morphology; Selective laser melting (SLM); Specific energy density; Spherical powders; Stable structures; Powder metals","","","","",", (20K14623)","","Alkahari M.

In this study, the composite scaffolds of polylactic acid (PLA) and nano-hydroxyapatite (n-HA) were manufactured by the fused deposition modeling (FDM) technique. Equal mass PLA and n-HA were uniformly mixed to simulate the organic and inorganic phases of natural bone. The suitability of the composite scaffolds was evaluated by material characterization, mechanical property, and in vitro biocompatibility, and the osteogenesis induction in vitro was further tested. Finally, the printed scaffold was implanted into the rabbit femoral defect model to evaluate the osteogenic ability in vivo. The results showed that the composite scaffold had sufficient mechanical strength, appropriate pore size, and biocompatibility. Most importantly, the osteogenic induction performance of the composite scaffold was significantly better than that of the pure PLA scaffold. In conclusion, the PLA/n-HA scaffold is a promising composite biomaterial for bone defect repair and has excellent clinical transformation potential.  © 2021 Wenzhao Wang et al.","3D printing; bone defect; composited biomaterials; nano-hydroxyapatite; polylactic acid","3D printers; Biocompatibility; Defects; Deposition; Hydroxyapatite; Polyesters; Pore size; Repair; Scaffolds (biology); 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Bone defect; Composite scaffolds; Composited; Composited biomaterial; In-vitro; Nano-hydroxyapatite; Osteogenic; Property; Nanocomposites","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (31971251, 81874002); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFC1106800); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","Funding information: This work was partially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFC1106800).

The availability of AM data provides Design for AM (DfAM) with a newfound opportunity to construct AM design rules with improved understanding of AM's influence on part qualities. To seize the opportunity, this paper proposes a novel approach for AM design rule construction based on machine learning and knowledge graph. First, this paper presents a framework that enables i) deploying machine learning for extracting knowledge on predictive additive manufacturability from data, ii) adopting ontology with knowledge graphs as a knowledge base for storing both a priori and newfound AM knowledge, and iii) reasoning with knowledge for deriving data-driven prescriptive AM design rules. Second, this paper presents a methodology that constructs knowledge on predictive additive manufacturability and prescriptive AM design rules. In the methodology, we formalize knowledge representations, extractions, and reasoning, which enhances automated and autonomous construction and improvements of AM design rules. The methodology then employs a machine learning algorithm of Classification and Regression Tree on measurement data from National Institute of Standards and Technology for construction of a Laser Powder Bed Fusion-specific design rule for overhang features. This work supports AI related decision-making in additive manufacturability analysis and (re-)design for AM and guides machine learning to addressing problems related to AM design rules. This work is also meaningful as it provides sharable AM design rule knowledge with the AM society. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturability; Data; Design for additive manufacturing; Design rule; Knowledge; Machine learning","3D printers; Additives; Availability; Data mining; Decision making; Graphic methods; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge representation; Learning algorithms; Trees (mathematics); Turing machines; Autonomous constructions; Classification and regression tree; Data intensive; Knowledge graphs; Manufacturability; Manufacturability analysis; Measurement data; National Institute of Standards and Technology; Machine learning","","","","","National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST","This work was supported by the National Institute of Standards and Technology , Gaithersburg, MD, USA.

To overcome this disadvantage, a 3D interlinked porous polylactic acid (PLA) scaffold was fabricated by FDM, followed by the embedding of a polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold into the pores of the PLA at room temperature, yielding a PLA-PCL scaffold. In addition, PLA-PCL scaffolds with nanohydroxyapatite (PLA-PCL-nHAP) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (PLA-PCL-MWCNT) were also fabricated. Here, the FDM-fabricated PLA scaffold functions as the structural component, whereas the embedded PCL scaffold acts as the functional component, which provides a the ability to functionalize the scaffolds with the desired chemical or biological materials. The embedding process is straightforward, cost effective, and does not require sophistication. A mechanical characterization of the scaffolds suggests that the Young's modulus of the PLA-PCL scaffold (16.02 MPa) was higher than that of the FDM-fabricated PLA (9.98 MPa) scaffold, by virtue of embedded PCL matrix. In addition, finite element analysis showed that the von Mises stress on a mandible with scaffolds was 4.04 MPa, whereas for a mandible with a defect, it was 6.7 MPa, confirming the stress distribution efficiency and mechanical stability of these scaffolds. Furthermore, field emission-scanning electron microscope analysis implied the presence of interlinked porous structures with pore diameters of 50 µm to 300 µm. X-ray diffraction results revealed an increased crystallinity (%) in the embedded models (PLA-PCL, PLA-PCL-nHAP and PLA-PCL-MWCNT), compared to a PLA printed scaffold. Additionally, Raman analysis revealed that the embedding process did not cause chemical alterations in the polymeric chains. In vitro analysis with human osteoblasts demonstrated the osteoconductive nature of the scaffold, which supported mineralization. In brief, the advantage of our model is that it helps to overcome the difficulties of manufacturing a filament with the desired additives for FDM, and offers the ability to incorporate the desired concentrations of heat-labile bioactive molecules during the embedding process at ambient temperatures. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.","3D printing; bone tissue engineering; fused deposition printing; polycaprolactone; polylactic acid","Animals; Biocompatible Materials; Calcification, Physiologic; Cells, Cultured; Durapatite; Elastic Modulus; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Mandible; Materials Testing; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Mice; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Models, Biological; Nanocomposites; Nanotubes, Carbon; Osteoblasts; Osteogenesis; Polyesters; Porosity; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; Additives; Biological materials; Chemical analysis; Composite structures; Cost effectiveness; Crystallinity; Deposition; Elastic moduli; Embeddings; Fabrication; Fused Deposition Modeling; Mechanical stability; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Polymer blends; Scanning electron microscopy; Stresses; hydroxyapatite; multi walled nanotube; polycaprolactone; polylactic acid; biomaterial; carbon nanotube; nanocomposite; polycaprolactone; polyester; polylactide; Distribution efficiency; Elevated temperature; Field emission scanning electron microscopes; Functional components; Fused deposition modeling (FDM); Mechanical characterizations; Polycaprolactone scaffolds; Structural component; Article; bone conduction; bone mineralization; C3H/10T1/2 clone 8 cell line; controlled study; cytotoxicity; environmental temperature; field emission scanning electron microscopy; finite element analysis; fused deposition modeling; human; human cell; human tissue; hydrophobicity; in vitro study; leaching; mandible; osteoblast; polymerization; pore size; pore size distribution; Raman spectrometry; room temperature; stress; tissue embedding; tissue engineering; X ray diffraction; Young modulus; animal; biological model; bone development; cell culture; chemistry; cytology; materials testing; mesenchymal stem cell; mouse; porosity; procedures; scanning electron microscopy; surgery; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; ultrastructure; Scaffolds (biology)","","hydroxyapatite, 1306-06-5, 51198-94-8; polycaprolactone, 24980-41-4, 25248-42-4; polylactic acid, 26100-51-6; polylactide, 26680-10-4; Biocompatible Materials, ; Durapatite, ; Nanotubes, Carbon, ; poly(lactide), ; polycaprolactone, ; Polyesters, ","","","","","Cox S C, Thornby J A, Gibbons G J, Williams M A, Mallick K K, 3D printing of porous hydroxyapatite scaffolds intended for use in bone tissue engineering applications, Mater.

As a well-established laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) alloy, there are opportunities to utilise additive manufacturing in such applications. However, the creep behaviour of LPBF 316 L under multiaxial stress conditions must first be quantified before such opportunities are realised. Uniaxial and double notched bar creep tests have been performed and characterised using power-law relations to evaluate the creep strain and rupture properties of LPBF 316 L. The creep response was found to be anisotropic with specimen build orientation, with samples loaded perpendicular to the build direction (Horizontal) exhibiting 8 times faster minimum creep rates than samples built parallel to the build direction (Vertical) and significantly shorter rupture lives. This was mainly attributed to the columnar grain structure, which was aligned with the build direction of the LPBF samples. The multiaxial creep rupture controlling stress was determined and found to be a combination of the equivalent and max. principal stress. X-Ray CT measurements in selected samples illustrated that the samples were approximately 99.6% dense post-build and the quantity of damage post testing was determined. Optical and EBSD microstructural characterisation revealed intergranular creep damage present in the specimens, however rupture was ultimately trans-granular in nature and influenced by the presence and orientation of pre-existing processing defects relative to the sample build and loading direction. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","316 L; Creep; High temperature; Powder bed fusion; Selective laser melting","3D printers; Creep; Failure (mechanical); High temperature applications; Textures; 316 L stainless steel; Columnar grain structure; Creep deformations; Microstructural characterisation; Minimum creep rates; Multi-axial loadings; Power law relation; Rupture properties; Austenitic stainless steel","","","","","AWE plc, (30338995)","The authors thank AWE plc (contract 30338995) for funding Richard Williams for his PhD studies and Paul Hooper’s research fellowship.","Wong M., Tsopanos S., Sutcliffe C.J., Owen I., Selective laser melting of heat transfer devices, Rapid Prototyp.

This method includes two steps. First, an existing facet clustering-based approach is applied to automatically generate the alternative orientations of a laser powder bed fusion part. Second, support volume, volumetric error, surface roughness, build time and build cost are considered. Their values in each alternative orientation are estimated by certain estimation models. The weights of these factors are determined via pairwise comparison. The weighted sum model is used to calculate a summary value of the factors in each alternative orientation. According to the calculated summary values, an optimal orientation to build the part is generated. To demonstrate the method, a set of part orientation cases are tested, and effectiveness analysis and efficiency and characteristic comparisons are reported. The demonstration results suggest that the proposed method can work for both regular and freeform surface models, produce stable and reasonable results and provide desired efficiency. © 2020 The Author(s).

Many established metal AM processes involve layer-by-layer deposition and selective binding or melting of metal powders. However, these processes do not easily permit multi-material printing or printing directly onto non-planar surfaces. By contrast, AM techniques that deposit metal directly are typically low resolution (e.g., directed energy deposition), or cannot achieve bulk metal properties (e.g., ink-based methods). Here, we present a high resolution direct metal printing method that potentially addresses these limitations. Individual metal microparticles are electrohydrodynamically ejected on-demand from a nozzle-confined meniscus and laser-melted in-flight before landing and solidifying on a substrate. We demonstrate printing of solder and platinum particles ranging in size from 30 to 150 µm and explore the process parameter space as limited by the ejection conditions and the kinetics of melting, impact, and solidification. Our experiments demonstrate process compatibility with a wide range of powder feedstock materials, and tunability of the solidified morphology via the laser processing parameters. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Droplet; Electrohydrodynamic; Laser; Melting; Solidification","3D printers; Deposition; Electrohydrodynamics; Electronics industry; Laser materials processing; Melting; Metals; Morphology; Feedstock materials; Laser processing parameters; Layer by layer deposition; Non-planar surfaces; Platinum particles; Process compatibility; Process parameters; Solidified morphologies; Powder metals","","","","","BAE Systems Inc.; MIT Deshpande Center for Technical Innovation; National Science Foundation, NSF, (DMR-1419807); Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT","Financial support was provided by BAE Systems Inc. and the MIT Deshpande Center for Technical Innovation .

Among these structures, the interests on the use of lattice are increasing for both medical and mechanical applications. The mechanical behaviour of the structure is closely correlated to its shape and dimension. However, up to now, far too little attention has been paid to this aspect. Hence, this work aims to explore the effect of geometry, dimension and relative density of the cell structure on the compressive strength of specimens with lattice structures. For this purpose, various Lattice structures are designed with different geometries and dimensions. This approach leads to having structures with different relativity densities. Replicas of the designed structure are produced using Ti–6Al–4V powder processed by electron beam melting process. The samples are tested under compression. A new approach to calculate the absorbed energy up to failure by the lattice structure is presented. The results show a close relationship between the mechanical performance of the structure and the investigated parameters. In contrast with the current literature, the presented experimental data and a collection of the literature data highlight that the lattice structures with similar relative density do not exhibit the same Young’s modulus values.

The capability to recover and repair worn components, with costs that are gradually more affordable, is giving a boost to the development of these technologies. The direct laser metal deposition (DLMD) technology is taking a leading role in this domain. Manufacturing components, with high mechanical properties, require a careful process design and a continuous control. The monitoring of the thermal field thus assumes a crucial role in processes in which high-power sources are involved. Thermal treatments influence the microstructure, morphology and the grain size of the depositions indeed, which determine high-performance standards. In this work, an ytterbium fibre laser source was used to build single-track depositions of a nickel-based superalloy powder on a substrate of the same material. Temperature field monitoring was performed using a high-frequency (100 Hz) IR thermal camera, allowing an accurate monitoring of peeks temperature, thermal cycles and thermal gradients. Thermal data and process parameters were compared with metallographic analysis to capture the relation between the geometrical and microstructural characteristics of clads. The study focuses on the influence of the powder feed rate and energy density on thermal parameters. An innovative approach to the solidification map method, commonly implemented with numerical simulations of welding and additive manufacturing, has been successfully applied to experimental data giving results consistent with the literature. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Direct laser metal deposition; In situ monitoring; IR thermography; Nickel-based superalloy; Thermal camera; Thermal gradient","Additives; Deposition; Fiber lasers; Metallography; Morphology; Nickel; Nickel alloys; Numerical methods; Powder metals; Superalloys; High mechanical properties; Innovative approaches; Laser metal deposition; Manufacturing components; Metallographic analysis; Micro-structural characteristics; Nickel- based superalloys; Performance standards; 3D printers","","","","","Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Università e della Ricerca, (ARS01_00806, PNR 2015-2020); Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, it:MIUR, (CUP-D94I18000260001)","This study was partially funded by Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Università e della Ricerca, under the project # ARS01_00806 “Innovative Solutions for Quality and Sustainability of Advanced Manufacturing Processes” (Grant PNR 2015-2020, di cui al D.D. del 13 luglio 2017 n. 1735) and under the Programme “Department of Excellence” Legge 232/2016 (Grant No. CUP-D94I18000260001)”.

This mode is also widely used in laser and electron beam welding. This indicates the similarity of hydrodynamic processes, which differ significantly in the parameters of the applied radiation (power, power density and focusing spot diameter). Threshold conditions of thermocapillary deep penetration (without evaporation) for various metals (Al, Cu, Fe and Ti) in a wide range of changes in beam parameters, including those used for selective laser melting of a powder layer, are investigated. The comparison of calculated and experimental values of the radiation parameters corresponding to the transition to the deep penetration mode for selective laser melting of the powder layer and laser welding is presented. The correlation of these values confirms the thermocapillary mechanism of the deep cavity formation and the similarity of hydrodynamic processes at welding metals by using a laser beam. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","beam power density; focusing spot diameter; hydrodynamic process; Laser melting; penetration depth","Electron beams; Hydrodynamics; Laser beams; Melting; Metals; Powder metals; Selective laser melting; Beam power; Beam power density; Focusing spot diameter; Hydrodynamic process; Laser melting; Penetration depth; Powder layer; Power densities; Selective laser melting; Spots diameter; Deep penetration","","","","","","","Matialainen V.-P., Piili H., Salminen A., Et al., Preliminary investigation of keyhole phenomena during single layer fabrication in laser additive manufacturing of stainless steel, Phys Procedia, 78, pp. 377-387, (2015); Martin A.A., Calta N.P., Khairallah S.A., Et al., Dynamics of pore formation during laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing, Nat Commun, 10, (2019); Thanki A., Goossens L., Mertens R., Et al., Study of keyhole-porosities in selective laser melting using X-ray computed tomography, 9th Conference on Industrial Computed Tomography (iCT), (2019); Gunenthiram V., Peyre P., Schneider M., Et al., Analysis of laser—melt pool—powder bed interaction during the selective laser melting of a stainless steel, J Laser Appl, 29, 2, (2017); Bidare P., Bitharas I., Ward R.M., Et al., Fluid and particle dynamics in laser powder bed fusion, Acta Materialia, 142, pp. 107-120, (2018); Guo Q., Zhao C., Escano L.I., Et al., Transient dynamics of powder spattering in laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing process revealed by in-situ high-speed highenergy x-ray imaging, Acta Materialia, 151, pp. 169-180, (2018); Fabbro R., Dal M., Peyre P., Et al., Analysis and possible estimation of keyholedepths evolution, using laser operating parameters and material properties, J Laser Appl, 30, 3, (2018); Gladush G.G., Smurov I., Physics of laser materials processing: theory and experiment, (2011); Khomenko M.D., Kh M.F., Parametric investigation of microstructure after laser melting of metal powder layer, Procedia Eng, 201, pp. 645-654, (2017); Klemens P.G.J., Heat balance and flow conditions for electron beam and laser welding, Appl Phys, 47, (1976); Mahrle A., Beyer E., Theoretical evaluation of radiation pressure magnitudes and effects in laser material processing, Phys Scr, 94, 7, (2019); Fabbro R., Hamadou M., Coste F., Metallic vapor ejection on melt pool dynamics in deep penetration laser welding, J Laser Appl, 16, 1, pp. 16-19, (2004); Courtois M., Carin M., Le M.P., (2015); DebRoy T., David S.A., Physical processes in fusion welding, Rev Mod Phys, 67, 1, pp. 85-112, (1995); Seidgazov R.D., Verification of the melt displacement mechanism in deep penetration laser welding, Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference (Ed. by Prof B.

BJ relies on the ability to control, not only the placement of binder on the surface but also its imbibition into the powder bed. This is a complex process in which picoliter-sized droplets impact powder beds at velocities of 1–10 m/s. However, the effects of printing parameters such as droplet velocity, size, spacing, and inter-arrival time on saturation level (fraction of pore space filled with binder) and line formation (merging of droplets to form a line) are unknown. Prior attempts to predict saturation levels with simple measurements of droplet primitives and capillary pressure assume that droplet/powder interactions are dominated by static equilibrium and neglect the impact of printing parameters. This study analyzes the influence of these parameters on the effective saturation level and conditions for line formation when printing single lines into powder beds of varied materials (316 stainless steel, 420 stainless steel, and alumina) and varied particle size (d50=10–47 µm). Results show that increasing droplet velocity or droplet spacing decreases effective saturation while droplet spacing, velocity, and inter-arrival time affect line formation. At constant printing velocity, the conditions for successful line printing are shown to be a function of droplet spacing and square root of the droplet inter-arrival time analogous to the Washburn model for infiltration into a porous media. The results have implications to maximizing build rates and improving quality of small features in BJ. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Balling; Binder jetting; Inkjet; Saturation; Washburn infiltration","3D printers; Additives; Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Particle size; Porous materials; Velocity; 316 stainless steel; Complex Processes; Droplet spacings; Effective saturation; Ink jet technology; Inter-arrival time; Saturation levels; Static equilibrium; Drops","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1946724, CMMI-1946724)","This work is supported in part by NSF award CMMI-1946724 .","Ziaee M., Crane N.B., Binder jetting: a review of process, materials, and methods, Addit.

Considering the layer-wise nature of this technique, the possibility of fabricating fine features is tied to the ability to deposit thin powder layers in this process. Since the powder layer thickness is directly dictated by the powder particle size, finer powders are required to further enhance the ability of the L-PBF technique in manufacturing fine features and intricate geometries. Accordingly, this study aims at investigating the processability of fine AlSi10Mg powder (D50 = 9 µm) by using the L-PBF process. The densification level, surface quality and dimensional accuracy of the final parts are investigated in a wide range of process parameters and are compared to those manufactured by the commonly used AlSi10Mg powder (referred to as coarse powder with D50 = 40 µm). The underlying reasons behind the different processability of fine and coarse powders are explored from the density, surface quality, microhardness and dimensional accuracy viewpoints through analyzing the flowability, bed packing density and optical absorption of powders. Moreover, the process-microstructure-microhardness relationship is assessed in detail for both fine and coarse powders. This study reinforces the idea that the utilization of fine powders in the range used in this study for L-PBF processing is rather challenging. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Density; Dimensional accuracy; Laser absorptivity; Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF); Particle size; Surface roughness","3D printers; Light absorption; Microhardness; Powders; Silicon; Surface properties; Coarse powders; Complex geometries; Dimensional accuracy; Higher efficiency; Packing density; Powder particles; Process parameters; Processability; Particle size","","","","","","","Schelling P.K., Shi L., Goodson K.E., Managing heat for electronics, Mater.

The high-strength wrought Al alloy has typically been unsuitable for AM due to its particular solidification characteristics such as hot cracking, porosity and columnar grain growth. Design/methodology/approach: In this research work, samples were fabricated using L-PBF under various laser energy densities by varying laser power and scan speed. The microstructural features that developed during the solidification are correlated with operating laser parameters. In addition, finite element modelling (FEM) was performed to understand the experimentally observed results. Findings: Microstructure evolution and defect formation have been assessed, quantified and correlated with operating laser parameters. Thermal behaviour of samples was predicted using FEM to support experimental observations. An optimised combination of intermediate laser power and scan speed produced the least defects. Higher energy density increased hot tearing along the columnar grain boundaries, while lower energy density promoted void formation. From the quantitative results, it is evident that with increasing energy density, both the top surface and side wall roughness initially reduced till a minimum and then increased. Hardness and compressive strength were found to decrease with increasing power density due to stress relaxation from hot tearing. Originality/value: This research work examined how L-PBF processing conditions influence the microstructure, defects, surface roughness and mechanical properties. The results indicates that complete elimination of solidification cracks can be only achieved by combining process optimisation and possible grain refining strategies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing (AM);

However, high pore density and large surface imperfections impede their overall mechanical and chemical performance. Thus, the components are often post-treated with mechanical- and thermal-based treatments to overcome their inherent imperfections and enhance their final mechanical properties. Although the post-processing treatments are useful in enhancing the selective laser melted components’ mechanical performance, their effect on corrosion behavior is not comprehensively evaluated. In this study, the selective laser melting prepared maraging steel samples’ corrosion behavior was examined in the as-built condition and compared with the post-processed samples subjected to aging and drag finishing operations. Compared to the as-built condition, both aging and drag-finishing post-processing treatments increased the selective laser melting samples’ corrosion even though the surface integrity was improved. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","additive manufacturing; Corrosion resistance; drag-finishing; heat-treatment; maraging steel; selective laser melting","Corrosive effects; Drag; Finishing; Maraging steel; Melting; Steel corrosion; Chemical performance; Corrosion behavior; Finishing operation; Large surfaces; Mechanical performance; Post processing; Static strength; Surface integrity; Selective laser melting","","","","","","","Langelaar M., Addit.

However, AM often suffers from its own limitations, such as the need for support structures, the presence of the stair-step effect and long build time. Recently, Part Decomposition (PD) techniques have been deployed to overcome these limitations. PD refers to the process of decomposing an original model into sub-assemblies. In the literature, PD studies have often proposed specific design considerations to evaluate that an original model is properly decomposed. For a comprehensive perspective, we address common and essential design considerations based on the standard design guidelines for AM in ISO/ASTM 52910. Since the standard design guidelines cover a variety of perspectives, we focus on the design considerations for additive manufacturability and assemblability. Then, evaluation indicators are defined for the design considerations as mathematical forms to quantitatively evaluate decomposed parts. The evaluation indicators are applied to the optimization of PD. As an optimization approach, a genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to recursively evaluate the outcomes of PD. In the GA, PD processes including concave feature-based PD (CPD) and convex feature-based PD (VPD) are considered to elaborately decompose an original model. In case studies, 9 models are compared with their decomposed parts for material extrusion (ME) and vat photopolymerization (VP) processes. On average, the build time decreases by 21% for ME and 70% for VP and the material consumption is reduced by 27% for ME and 22% for VP. Furthermore, when our optimization approach is compared to another similar method, Near-convex Decomposition (NCD), the material consumption is reduced by an average of 26% and 62% for ME and VP processes, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturability; Assemblability; Evaluation; Optimization; Part decomposition; Standard design guidelines","Additives; Design; Genetic algorithms; ISO Standards; Photopolymerization; Convex decomposition; Design considerations; Evaluation indicators; Material consumption; Mathematical forms; Optimization approach; Support structures; Traditional manufacturing; 3D printers","","","","","Allison Barnard Feeney; National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST; Hanyang University, HYU","We thank Allison Barnard Feeney, Paul Witherell and Vijay Srinivasan at NIST, and Dongmin Shin at Hanyang University, and the anonymous peer-reviewers for their valuable comments and input.

CMC with combined cellulose fibres of high cellulose content for dispersion compounds and fine dehydrated particles allows a 50% fibre matrix hydrolysis. Evaluation of the microstructure composite particle of CMC in 4D surface luminance structure and the profile structure was done. Cross-sectional views and surface roughness, waviness profile of the specimens are extracted and analysed, with the coresonding Gaussian filter for accurate decomposition of particles was carry out. The nanoparticle characterisation of the thermoplastic form was used in the mixed sedimentation process to create an polymer composite structure when analyse. The shrinkage properties of the materials are evaluated to understand the relationship between the deformation according to the time and direction of the 4D printing analysis. The ability of computational ultra-sonication microstructure to be used correctly for 4D printing is demonstrated by evaluating a complex microstructure that can change with time according to the predefined design rules to respond to moisture.

The present investigation aims to characterize a prototypical AM Al alloy with great potential for structural applications. An Al-1.5Cu-0.8Sc-0.4Zr alloy designed using integrated computational material engineering was printed using the laser powder bed fusion AM process. This novel alloy shows promising combination of strength and ductility in as-built and peak-aged conditions. This improvement in the tensile properties is attributed to the presence of both coherent L12 Al3Sc/Al3(Sc,Zr) precipitates and Cu-rich regions. The microstructures were studied via extensive microscopy at different length scales using X-ray microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Fractography revealed that the columnar grain boundaries in as-built condition allow easy slip transfer as compared to the equiaxed grains, with the apex of the melt pool acting as the crack nucleation site. However, the peak aged condition resulted in improved strength while marginally sacrificing ductility due to precipitates decorating dislocations, grain boundaries and melt pool boundaries thus acting as obstacles to slip transfer. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Aluminum alloys; Fractography; Texture; X-ray microscopy","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum metallography; Copper alloys; Copper metallography; Ductility; Fracture mechanics; Grain boundaries; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Laser materials processing; Scandium alloys; Scanning electron microscopy; Textures; Zircaloy; Zirconium metallography; Computational materials; Crack nucleation; Different length scale; In-depth understanding; Microstructure and mechanical properties; Peak aged conditions; Strength and ductilities; Structural applications; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Materials Research Facility; Office of Naval Research, ONR, (00014-17-1-2559)","The work was sponsored by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), USA under the ONR Award #N00014-17-1-2559.

This paper investigates the formulation of a resin suitable for DLP-based fabrication of low density, high modulus structures with fine resolution of negative and positive features. An acrylate-based resin is loaded with a high-volume fraction (50 vol%) of hollow glass microspheres achieving adequate cured depth to fabricate 25 µm layer thicknesses. The suspension stability over typical multi-hour DLP print durations is verified. The filled resin exhibited a viscosity less than 5 Pa-s, which is below the upper limit of viscosity to recoat the Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) window between layers. The printed material possesses a uniform density distribution of 0.81 g cm−3 investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and micro-Computed Tomography (micro-CT) imaging. The minimum feature sizes for the formulation are demonstrated as 400 µm for internal cavities (negative features) and 250 µm for protruding features (positive features). An example of a structure with an intricate geometry is created by printing a repeating mechanical metamaterial unit cell. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Acrylates; Digital light processing; Highly filled formulations; Low density composite","Aerospace industry; Computerized tomography; Electronics industry; Polydimethylsiloxane; Resins; Silicones; Thermogravimetric analysis; Viscosity; Density distributions; Digital light processing; High volume fraction; Hollow glass microspheres; Micro computed tomography (micro-CT); Minimum feature sizes; Polydimethylsiloxane PDMS; Sensitive application; 3D printers","","","","","CCDEVCOM Army Research Laboratory, (W911NF-17-2-0173); Sean Roche","Funding text 1: This research was supported by CCDEVCOM Army Research Laboratory through Cooperative Agreement W911NF-17-2-0173 .

Nevertheless, it is still not a widely used method due to different process-related challenges. In recent years printer technologies and possible printable materials emerged but there are still challenging demands on the printing process. Hence, it is of vital importance to inspect the manufacturability of the designed parts. This work focuses on the not yet widely researched ceramic printing with the Lithography-based Ceramic Manufacturing (LCM) processes. It presents a knowledge-driven framework able to automatically examine geometric properties of a part and compare it to AM guidelines. As a knowledge base, an ontology is used which contains information about the capabilities of AM processes, printers and materials. The manufacturability system uses triangle-based mesh processing algorithms to recognize features and check the guidelines necessary for LCM. The evaluation shows the feasibility of manufacturability analysis with the developed framework and its limitations. © 2020 IEEE.","Additive manufacturing; computer-aided design; knowledge representation; manufacturability analysis; ontology","Additives; Ceramics industry; Knowledge based systems; Printing presses; Ceramic printing; Geometric properties; Manufacturability; Manufacturability analysis; Manufacturing tools; Mesh processing; Printable materials; Printing process; 3D printers","","","","","","","Gibson I., Rosen D.W., Stucker B., Khorasani M., Additive Manufacturing Technologies, 17, (2014); Nelaturi S., Kim W., Kurtoglu T., Manufacturability feedback and model correction for additive manufacturing, J.

The melt pool is created by scanning a high-power laser beam across a metal powder bed. Rapid heating and cooling processes are involved in the layer-by-layer fabrication of the metal part. Recent advances in Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms provide efficient ways to analyze large sets of data in search of correlations that would otherwise be extremely time-consuming. The use of Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms to understand temperature variations in AM fabrication process will allow to predict the formation of porosity before it occurs. The objective of this research is to advance the AM technology using enhanced Deep Learning techniques to provide in-situ analysis of the melt pool temperature that can lead to a reliable manufacturing of Three-Dimensional (3D) metal parts/components. In specific, Deep Learning based porosity prediction for Additive Manufacturing (DLAM) methods have been proposed. In DLAMs, several state-of-the-art Deep Learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using transfer learning, and Residual-Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (Res-RCNN) are proposed for effectively performing the end-to-end porosity prediction in real-time using thermal images of melt pool. Experimental results, in this research, show that the Res-RCNN has an overall accuracy of 99.49% and inference time of 8.67ms , and the Res-RCNN outperforms other baseline models. The Res-RCNN's recursive architecture allows the network to view each input image multiples times and at varying feature levels, which enables a slight boost in porosity prediction accuracy over the commonly used transfer learning CNN models.  © 2013 IEEE.","Anomaly detection; convolutional neural network; deep learning; metal additive manufacturing; porosity prediction; recurrent neural network; thermal images analysis","3D printers; Additives; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Engineering education; Forecasting; High power lasers; Industrial research; Lakes; Laser beams; Learning systems; Metals; Porosity; Powder metals; Recurrent neural networks; Transfer learning; Fabrication process; Layer-by-layer fabrication; Learning techniques; Melt pool temperature; Porosity predictions; Recursive architecture; Temperature variation; Threedimensional (3-d); Learning algorithms","","","","","CATIE; Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL; Army Research Laboratory, ARL; Mississippi State University, MSU","Funding text 1: The data utilized, in this paper, was obtained by Mississippi State University (MSU) and funded by the Army Research Laboratory [42].

The correct choice of process parameters is of fundamental importance to obtain a porosity free component. In this work a model is described able to simulate the printing process. The proposed model is a simplified numerical tool for designing processing windows suitable to metal alloys of any composition. The considered approach makes the model use as much practical as possible, while keeping the physical description representative. The model is validated fitting experimental measures of track width, depth and cross sectional area taken from three literature sources, referring to: Ti6Al4V, Inconel 625 and Al7050. Effective liquid pool thermal conductivity, laser absorptivity and depth of application of laser energy are here considered as fitting parameters. Laser absorptivity and depth of application of laser energy result to rise almost linearly with increasing specific energy; the slopes of the three analyzed alloys result very close to each other. The obtained results give confidence about the possibility of using the model as a predicting tool after further calibration on a wider range of metal alloys. © 2021.

The processability of the polymer powders was evaluated in terms of powder morphology, powder flowability, melting behavior, and crystallization kinetics. An isothermal differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) testing protocol was employed as an effective and efficient method to facilitate the determination of suitable powder bed temperature. The results showed that the sintering window of iPP (26.3 ℃) was similar to that of polyamide 12 (PA12) (25.8 ℃), while CoPP had a narrower sintering window (2.2 ℃), making it much less tolerant to temperature deviations that occur during printing, and thus more prone to warping. The crystallization activation energy values of iPP and CoPP were ∼60 % that of PA12, suggesting that both of the PP materials were less sensitive to temperature fluctuations close to their crystallization temperatures. At optimal processing parameters, the ultimate tensile strength and elongation at break values of the printed iPP and CoPP specimens were found to be 14.9 MPa and 1 %, and 19.5 MPa and 207 %, respectively. Importantly, it was established that for PP with high regio- and stereo-irregularities, such as CoPP, SLS serves as a viable alternative manufacturing technique for producing PP parts comprising γ-phase crystals that are difficult to manufacture by conventional moulding processes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Polypropylene; Selective laser sintering","Activation energy; Crystallization kinetics; Differential scanning calorimetry; Laser heating; Polypropylenes; Sintering; Tensile strength; Crystallization activation energy; Crystallization temperature; Isotactic polypropylene; Manufacturing techniques; Polypropylene homopolymer; Selective laser sintering(SLS); Temperature fluctuation; Ultimate tensile strength; Selective laser sintering","","","","","Singapore and Robert Bosch; Robert Bosch; Economic Development Board - Singapore, EDB","Funding text 1: The work was supported by the Economic Development Board (EDB) , Singapore and Robert Bosch (SEA) Pte Ltd through the Industrial Postgraduate Program with School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. ; Funding text 2: The work was supported by the Economic Development Board (EDB), Singapore and Robert Bosch (SEA) Pte Ltd through the Industrial Postgraduate Program with School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.","Yuan S., Et al., Polymeric composites for powder-based additive manufacturing: materials and applications, Prog.

To investigate these effects, uniaxial tension testing was performed after conditioning specimens under heat or moisture. Results showed that conditioning temperature substantially influences the failure strain in multiple orientations.

Fused filament fabrication, known as three-dimensional (3D) printing technique is considered a rapid prototyping technique that is frequently applied for production of samples of ABS material. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the mechanical and fracture behavior of such materials and the techniques to improve such properties. Design/methodology/approach: Experimental and numerical analyses have been conducted to investigate the effects of internal architecture and chopped carbon fiber (CF) fillers on the mechanical properties and mixed mode fracture behavior of the ABS samples made by 3D printing technique. Four different filling types at 70% filling ratios have been used to produce tensile and special fracture test samples with pure and CF filled ABS filaments (CF-ABS) using 3D process. A special fixture has been developed to apply mixed mode loading on fracture samples, and finite element analyses have been conducted to determine the geometric function of such samples at different loading angles. Findings: It has been determined that the printing pattern has a significant effect on the mechanical properties of the sample. The addition of 15% CF to pure ABS resulted in a significant increase in tensile strength of 46.02% for line filling type and 15.04% for hexagon filling type. It has been determined that as the loading angle increases from 0° to 90°, the KIC value decreases. The addition of 15% CF increased the KIC values for hexagonal and line filling type by 64.14% and 12.5%, respectively. Originality/value: The damage that will occur in ABS samples produced in 3D printers depends on the type, amount, filling speed, filling type, filling ratio, filling direction and mechanical properties of the additives. All these features are clearly dependent on the production method. Even if the same additive is used, the production method difference shows different microstructural parameters, especially different mechanical properties. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","3D printing; Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene; Carbon fiber filled ABS filaments; Fracture; Fused filament fabrication","ABS resins; Additives; Fabrication; Filling; Fracture mechanics; Fracture testing; Graphite fibers; Polymer blends; Styrene; Tensile strength; Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene; Carbon fiber reinforced; Design/methodology/approach; Experimental and numerical analysis; Internal architecture; Microstructural parameters; Thermoplastic polymer; Three-dimensional (3D) printing; 3D printers","","","","","Adana Alparslan Türkeş Science and Technology University, (20103002)","This work was supported by Adana Alparslan Türkeş Science and Technology University Scientific Research Coordination Unit.

However, predicting the formation and morphology of the eutectic structure is difficult, especially under a large range of undercooling. In this paper, a comprehensive model taking account of the eutectic point migration and a dynamic concentration nucleation criterion was developed based on a cellular automaton method to predict the irregular eutectic structure of Al-Si alloys, and the evolution mechanism of the Al-Si irregular eutectic under a large range of undercooling of 5–20 K was numerically investigated. This model was then applied to predict the hypoeutectic microstructures of two processes with greatly different cooling rates: a traditional casting process (copper mold casting) and an additive manufacturing process (selective laser melting), in which the cooling and solidification characteristics of AlSi10Mg alloys were calculated by a double-solid-liquid interface enthalpy model. The results indicate that the eutectic Al and Si present a synergistic effect to promote the crystallization rate significantly, the solidification rate of eutectic is much higher than that of primary, and the morphology of eutectic Si changes from coarse lamellar structure to refined particles as the increase of the eutectic undercooling. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Al-Si alloys; Cellular automaton; Irregular eutectic","Aluminum alloys; Cellular automata; Eutectics; Forecasting; Lamellar structures; Morphology; Phase interfaces; Selective laser melting; Solidification; Undercooling; Additive manufacturing process; Cellular automaton method; Crystallization rates; Eutectic structures; Evolution mechanism; Hypoeutectic microstructure; Solid-liquid interfaces; Solidification characteristics; Silicon alloys","","","","","Youth Academic Launch Program of Beijing Institute of Technology; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51905038); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFB1105304); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2018YFB1105304 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51905038 ), and the Youth Academic Launch Program of Beijing Institute of Technology .","Aguilera-Luna I., Castro-Roman M.J., Escobedo-Bocardo J.C., Garcia-Pastor F.A., Herrera-Trejo M., Effect of cooling rate and Mg content on the Al-Si eutectic for Al-Si-Cu-Mg alloys, Mater.

Finite element analysis (FEA) based on the inherent strain method using a voxel mesh is an effective prediction method due to its reasonable analysis time, and to efficiently implement the prediction, a method of easily and accurately defining the inherent strain value is required. In this study, an analysis method based on multi-layer model theory was proposed to evaluate the inherent strain applicable to electron beam melting. The inherent strains obtained by the analysis were -0.835% and -3.42% for 12Cr steel and Co alloy, respectively.

Design/methodology/approach: Particle concentrations in the operating environments of users were measured using a combination of particle sizers including the TSI 3910 Nano SMPS (10–420 nm) and the TSI 3330 optical particle sizer (0.3–10 µm). Also, fumes from a MEX printer during printing were directly captured using laser imaging method. Findings: The number and mass concentration of submicron particles emitted from a desktop open-type MEX printer for acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene and polyvinyl alcohol approached and significantly exceeded the nanoparticle reference limits, respectively. Through laser imaging, fumes were observed to originate from the printer nozzle and from newly deposited layers of the desktop MEX printer. On the other hand, caution should be taken in the pre-processing of metal and polymer powder. Specifically, one to ten micrometers of particles were observed during the sieving, loading and cleaning of powder, with transient mass concentrations ranging between 150 and 9,000 µg/m3 that significantly exceeded the threshold level suggested for indoor air quality. Originality/value: Preliminary investigation into possible exposures to particle emissions from different 3D printing processes was done, which is useful for the sustainable development of the 3D printing industry. In addition, automatic processes that enable “closed powder cycle” or “powder free handling” should be adopted to prevent users from unnecessary particle exposure. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Directed energy deposition; Indoor air quality; Material extrusion; Material jetting; Particle emission; Powder bed fusion","Air cleaners; Air quality; Indoor air pollution; Metal extrusion; Polymers; Powder metals; Printing presses; Styrene; Sustainable development; 3D printing process; Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene; Design/methodology/approach; Manufacturing techniques; Operating environment; Particle concentrations; Polymer-based materials; Sub-micron particles; 3D printers","","","","","Singapore Centre for 3D Printing, (SC3DP); Singapore Ministry of Education MOE2016-T2-1; National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Cluster, NAMIC; Nanyang Technological University, NTU, (2020024, M4082022); Nanyang Technological University, NTU","This study was funded by the Singapore Ministry of Education MOE2016-T2-1–063, supported by the National Additive Manufacturing – Innovation Cluster @ NTU (NAMIC@NTU) through Grant No. 2020024 and partially supported by the Start-up Grant by NTU M4082022.

Future regenerative medicine–based approaches for auricular cartilage reconstruction will benefit from a smart combination of various strategies. Our approach to fabrication of an ear-shaped construct uses hybrid bioprinting techniques, a recently identified progenitor cell population, previously validated biomaterials, and a smart scaffold design. Specifically, we generated a 3D-printed polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold via fused deposition modeling, photocrosslinked a human auricular cartilage progenitor cell–laden gelatin methacryloyl (gelMA) hydrogel within the scaffold, and cultured the bioengineered structure in vitro in chondrogenic media for 30 days. Our results show that the fabrication process maintains the viability and chondrogenic phenotype of the cells, that the compressive properties of the combined PCL and gelMA hybrid auricular constructs are similar to native auricular cartilage, and that biofabricated hybrid auricular structures exhibit excellent shape fidelity compared with the 3D digital model along with deposition of cartilage-like matrix in both peripheral and central areas of the auricular structure. Our strategy affords an anatomically enhanced auricular structure with appropriate mechanical properties, ensures adequate preservation of the auricular shape during a dynamic in vitro culture period, and enables chondrogenically potent progenitor cells to produce abundant cartilage-like matrix throughout the auricular construct. The combination of smart scaffold design with 3D bioprinting and cartilage progenitor cells holds promise for the development of clinically translatable regenerative medicine strategies for auricular reconstruction. © 2021 The Author(s)","Auricular cartilage; Bioprinting; Cartilage progenitor cells; Mechanical reinforcement; Shape preservation","3D modeling; Biomechanics; Cartilage; Cell culture; Cell proliferation; Cells; Deposition; Fused Deposition Modeling; Human engineering; Regenerative Medicine; Structural design; 3-d digital modeling; Biofabrication; Chondrogenic phenotypes; Compressive properties; Fabrication process; Polycaprolactone scaffolds; Progenitor cell; Shape preservation; Scaffolds (biology)","","","","","Department of Anatomy; University Medical Center Utrecht; European Research Council, ERC; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (IA 52242); Dutch Arthritis Foundation, (LLP-12, CO-14-001, LLP-22); Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, (022.005.018); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (647426)","The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.

Design/methodology/approach: The proposed novel device consists of an array of load cells for in-situ measurement of forces over time during the L-PBF additive manufacturing process. Measurements of the developed forces layer by layer were recorded in a first build using a 67-degree rotating scan strategy using Inconel 625 build material. Findings: Preliminary experimental results from in-situ measurements using a 67-degree rotating scan strategy showed that the forces induced in the first five layers represented approximately 80% of the maximum on completion of the build and were distributed such as to induce concave deformation of the part, i.e. tension in the centre and compression at the edges of the part. Originality/value: This paper describes a novel device for in-process measurement of the spatial distribution and time-varying nature of the forces induced during the L-PBF process as well as an evaluation of the residual forces following the completion of the build. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Force measurement;

This paper attempts to take the opposite view by examining whether it is interesting to use knowledge on “morphogenesis” (cf. Alan Turing) and other conceptual ideas of spontaneous self-organization to achieve a desired shape. This new and more systemic form of 3D/4D printing enables the self-assembly and establishment of elements (voxels) in various environments through the use of programmable or smart matter. The necessary convergence of interacting elements requires a related decisive activity, however, to the sign of unknown, indecision, complexity, unpredictable bifurcations, in short of scientific promise that cannot be robustly kept. Beyond this frame of generalized non-decidability—a form of abandonment of self-organization paradigm in favour of deterministic doctrines—, there are paths to partial success where desired spatial transformations can be created through (mastered?) disorder. The paper presents the conceptual bases of 3D self-organization with some illustrative examples. The objective is to highlight the interests of this disruptive vision with its realistic limits. © 2021 The Author(s).

It is necessary to objectively analyze the current status and challenges associated with 3DP and identify future research directions to properly understand its construction applications. Previous research has focused more on the technical dimension of 3DP; however, the nontechnical dimension of the technology may hinder its implementation and thus must be paid particular attention to. This study presents a systematic review of the existing literature from both technical and nontechnical dimensions by combining quantitative and qualitative studies. The quantitative study was conducted using scientometric methods. The qualitative study analyzed information, including the technical research status and nontechnical challenges and trends. Two aspects of technical research status are presented, including materials and processes. In addition, nontechnical challenges and trends from the economic, environmental, social, and legislative aspects are proposed. This study provides a comprehensive agenda to advance 3DP in construction and proposes research interests, challenges, and future topics. It is intended to help construction practitioners systematically master existing processes and materials and assess the application degree and necessity of 3DP.  © 2021 Xin Ning et al.","","","","","","","","","Huang S.H., Liu P., Mokasdar A., Hou L., Additive manufacturing and its societal impact: A literature review, International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 67, 5-8, pp. 1191-1203, (2013);

Additive manufacturing (AM) offers design freedom with regard to Ti-6Al-4V for creation of high-quality, customized products. However, the large-scale development of this technology is constrained by the high raw material costs. In this study, a method based on ball milling powder modification was proposed to convert low cost, non-spherical hydrogenated-dehydrogenated Ti (HDH-Ti) powder into spherical, printable Ti powder. Following mechanical mixing, the ball-milled HDH-Ti powder was further blended with elemental powders of aluminum and vanadium to develop low-cost HDH Ti-6Al-4V. Simultaneously, the issue pertaining to high oxygen associated with HDH Ti-6Al-4V was addressed via introduction of yttrium. A cost-affordable, high-performance AM Ti-6Al-4V alloy was finally developed via laser-based powder bed fusion of metals (PBF-LB/M) after printing parameter optimization and heat treatment. The AM-prepared Ti-6Al-4V demonstrated a relative density of 99.3%, an ultimate tensile strength of ~1083 MPa, and an elongation of 9%, comparable to those obtained using costly pre-alloyed powders. Further, numerical simulation and detailed microstructural characterization were performed to reveal the underlying mechanism. Powder modification, compositional modulation, and laser in-situ alloying were the three essential techniques used as part of this approach for optimizing the mechanical properties of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Overall, this method demonstrates excellent potential in terms of mitigating the high cost. Moreover, it may further promote research on AM of a variety of Ti alloys besides Ti-6Al-4V. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Compositional modulation; Laser in-situ alloying; Powder bed fusion; Powder modification; Ti-6Al-4V","3D printers; Additives; Alloying; Aluminum alloys; Amplitude modulation; Ball milling; Costs; Heat treatment; Powder metals; Product design; Tensile strength; Ternary alloys; Compositional modulation; Customized products; Large-scale development; Micro-structural characterization; Parameter optimization; Pre-alloyed powder; Raw material costs; Ultimate tensile strength; Titanium alloys","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51971108); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, (JCYJ20180504165824643); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality; State Key Laboratory of Advanced Design and Manufacturing for Vehicle Body, SKLDMVB, (31915006); State Key Laboratory of Advanced Design and Manufacturing for Vehicle Body, SKLDMVB; Major Discipline Academic and Technical Leaders Training Program of Jiangxi Province, (20182BCB22001); Major Discipline Academic and Technical Leaders Training Program of Jiangxi Province; Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province, (2019B090907001); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province","Dr. Ming Yan appreciates the support of the Humboldt Research Fellowship for Experienced Researchers .

Notably, bioprinting bioinks are limited due to the mechanical weakness of natural biomaterials and the low bioactivity of synthetic peers. This paper presents the development of a natural bioink from chicken eggwhite and sodium alginate for bioprinting cell-laden patches to be used in endothelialized tissue engineering applications. Eggwhite was utilized for enhanced biological properties, while sodium alginate was used to improve bioink printability. The rheological properties of bioinks with varying amounts of sodium alginate were examined with the results illustrating that 2.0–3.0% (w/v) sodium alginate was suitable for printing patch constructs. The printed patches were then characterized mechanically and biologically, and the results showed that the printed patches exhibited elastic moduli close to that of natural heart tissue (20–27 kPa) and more than 94% of the vascular endothelial cells survived in the examination period of one week post 3D bioprinting. Our research also illustrated the printed patches appropriate water uptake ability (>1800%). © 2021 by the authors.

Among the polymeric materials, Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) and Poly Lactic Acid (PLA) can be the competitive materials in such application after 3D-printing. In this study, 3D printing was used to produce samples from ABS and PLA via fused deposition modelling (FDM) technology. Then friction behavior of 3D-printed samples was investigated depending on printing orientation of the samples. Ultra High Molecular Polyethylene Weight (UHMWPE), as a well-known industrial polymer, was also used for comparing the friction behavior of 3D-printed ABS and PLA polymers. Friction tests were conducted using a pin-on-plate type tribometer according to ASTM G133 under different applied loads and sliding speeds at room temperature. It was found that printing orientation of all ABS and PLA samples has a considerable effect on their friction behavior. Transverse direction (T.D) of the 3D-printed samples shows higher coefficient of friction (COF) values than the longitudinal direction under all applied loads and sliding speeds. On the other hand, COF values obtained in both 3D-printed samples increase as the load and speed increase regardless of the printing direction. When both 3D-printed materials are compared, PLA samples exhibit lower COF values than ABS samples in both printing directions and under all loads and speeds. However, the UHMWPE sample produced with traditional method shows much lower COF values and stable change in friction behavior under all conditions compared to 3D-printed PLA and ABS samples. © 2021 Materiale Plastice.

Design/methodology/approach: An artifact that does not require support when printing was designed and printed to allow performance of the face-diagonal length test. A Vernier caliper was used to measure the lengths of diagonals in the XY, YZ and ZX planes of the printed artifact specimen; this completed the face-diagonal length test. The relationships between position-independent geometric errors of the linear axes X, Y and Z and the measured diagonal lengths of the three planes were determined to identify geometric errors. Findings: The approach was applied to a commercial fused deposition modeling 3D printer, and three position-independent geometric errors were rapidly identified. The artifact was re-printed after model-based compensation for these errors and the diagonal lengths were re-measured. The results were verified via coordinate measuring machine measurement of a simple test piece without and with model-based compensation for identified geometric errors. Furthermore, the proposed approach was applied to a commercial 3D printer. Research limitations/implications: The measured diagonal lengths of the printed artifacts varied greatly. Thus, further studies should investigate the effects of printing materials and parameters on the length discrepancies of 3D printed artifacts. Practical implications: A software-based compensation of identified position-independent geometric errors has to be used at commercial 3D printers for accuracy improvements of printed parts. Originality/value: Thus, the approach is of practical utility; it can be periodically used to identify position-independent geometric errors and ensure that the 3D printer is consistently accurate. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Accuracy; Face-diagonal length test; Fused deposition modeling 3D printer; Position-independent geometric error; Vernier caliper","Deposition; Errors; Fused Deposition Modeling; Geometry; Layered manufacturing; Printing presses; Testing; Accuracy Improvement; Design/methodology/approach; Geometric errors; Model-based compensation; Printing materials; Software-based compensation; Threedimensional (3-d); Vernier caliper; 3D modeling","","","","","National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea, MSIT, (2019R1A2C2088683, 2020R1C1C100330011)","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (Nos. 2020R1C1C100330011 and 2019R1A2C2088683).

Understanding of high temperature tensile properties of LPBF fabricated 316L is, however, limited. In the present investigation, tensile testing was conducted at 20–700ºC on LPBF 316L in as printed condition and after annealing for 5 h at 500–800ºC. Room temperature data confirmed the excellent ductility of the LPBF-processed 316L steel due to the cellular structure with high dislocation density. However, a significant decrease in ductility was observed at temperatures above 200ºC. These results are consistent with a change of deformation mechanisms observed in wrought 316L, with twinning playing a key role at room temperature. Microstructure characterization and tensile testing revealed that the cellular structure is stable up to 500ºC, but a decrease of yield strength was observed at temperatures above 600ºC likely due to a decrease in dislocation density via annealing. © 2020","316L; LPBF; SLM; Tensile properties; Twinning","Cellular automata; Ductility; Fabrication; High temperature effects; Materials testing apparatus; Microstructure; Tensile testing; 316 L stainless steel; Cellular structure; Deformation mechanism; Dislocation densities; High dislocation density; High temperature tensile properties; Microstructure characterization; Strength and ductilities; Austenitic stainless steel","","","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE","The authors would like to thank, K.

The dry sliding wear behavior of EBPBF-Ti6Al4V against steel- and alumina-counterballs from room temperature (RT) to 500 °C was investigated to evaluate the influence of EBPBF processing and microstructure on the wear properties for broadening the application criteria of this lightweight alloy. The wear tests revealed that the wear rate decreased with increasing temperature due to formation of stable oxide glaze layer. This study reveals elevated temperature sliding wear behavior, wear mechanisms and microstructural changes below the wear track of EBPBF Ti6Al4V alloy against steel and alumina counterbodies. © 2020","Additive manufacturing; Aerospace; Electron beam powder bed fusion; High temperature tribology; Ti6Al4V; Wear properties","Aerospace applications; Alumina; Aluminum alloys; Aluminum oxide; Electron beams; Fabrication; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Tribology; Wear of materials; Dry sliding wear; Elevated temperature; Increasing temperatures; Light weight alloys; Microstructural changes; Processing Route; Sliding wear behaviors; Tribological performance; Vanadium steel","","","","","Stiftelsen för Strategisk Forskning, SSF, (RIF14–0083)","The authors would like to thank Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF) for Infrastructure Fellowship grant no.

However, distortion of additive-manufactured parts may interrupt the printing process and decrease manufacturing precision, causing a significant waste of time and money. Distortion, a common problem in additive manufacturing, has not been sufficiently researched. In this study, we provide a comprehensive understanding of distortion in additive manufacturing based on assumption of constraining force. A quantitative model was established to illustrate inconsistent shrinkage during the additive process. A qualitative model was then built for showing the distortion caused by inconsistent shrinkage. It can be founded that inconsistent shrinkage accumulated during the additive process drives the final distortion of part. We concluded most influencing factors of distortion together, forming towards a comprehensive understanding of distortion in additive manufacturing. This study not only links micro melting-solidification process and macro structural mechanics in science, but also provides systematic solutions for decreasing the distortion in additive manufacturing for engineering. © 2021 The Author(s).

For instance, lattice structures show potential in medical and lightweight applications as their mechanical properties can be scaled by the volume fraction of the cells according to the local requirements given by the load paths. In order to use lattice structures in design of structural parts, the mechanical properties need to be characterized. Due to the complex nature of the selective laser melting process, manufacturing imperfections as well as the microstructure play an important role and their effects can differ depending on volume fraction, building direction and especially load case (tension and compression). The aim of this study is to analyze these effects. In addition, a deeper understanding of the failure process is necessary which is gained by 3D digital image correlation and finite element simulations incorporating progressive damage. We found that surface defects are larger for horizontal struts printed directly on the powder bed and thus show a higher influence for specimens where building and loading direction are not aligned. Moreover, porosity leads to significantly different mechanical properties contingent on the load case. Depending on the volume fraction, different failure modes are observed which are captured and explained by finite element simulations allowing to avoid stress concentrations or undesired buckling in future designs. Finally, simulations of lattice structures are compared to computationally inexpensive simulations of unit cells with periodic boundary conditions. Good agreement is found and further insights into the influence of the load introduction are gained. © 2020","3D printing; Compression; Finite element modelling; Periodic boundary conditions; Selective laser melting; Tension","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Aluminum metallography; Biomechanics; Mechanical properties; Selective laser melting; Surface defects; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Vanadium metallography; Volume fraction; 3d digital image correlations; Finite element simulations; Lattice structures; Lightweight application; Manufacturing imperfections; Mechanical characterizations; Periodic boundary conditions; Tension and compression; Titanium metallography","","","","","Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy of Germany; Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie, BMWi, (20W1501M); Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie, BMWi","Financial support from the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy of Germany (BMWi) in the project “ALM2AIR” (project number: 20W1501M ) is gratefully acknowledged.

The disbalance of alloying of EP648 and VZh159 alloys is calculated. It is shown that a decrease in strength characteristics, an increase in ductility, and a decrease in the period between simulated annealing and fracture of EP648 alloy is related to a decrease in the volume fraction of the particles of the σ phase caused by precipitation of α-Cr particles. It is determined that the synthesized VZh159 alloy after simulated annealing is far superior to the EP648 alloy according to the set of mechanical characteristics owing to more balanced alloying. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","EP648; gasostatic processing; heterotypic compounds; HIP; selective laser melting; thermal treatment; TPU phases; transmission electron microscopy; VZh159; σ phase","Alloying; Melting; Precipitation (chemical); Simulated annealing; Cr particles; Disbalance; Mechanical characteristics; Sigma phase; Strength characteristics; Selective laser melting","","","","","","","Ermolaev A.S., Ivanov A.M., Vasilenko S.A., Laser technologies and processes in the manufacture and reparation of gas turbine engine parts, Vestn, Perm.

A primary focus was to evaluate the influence of material constitutive models on predicted mechanical behaviors. Johnson-Cook (JC) constitutive material models were chosen to account for the contribution of strain, strain rate, and temperature on material responses. Three different modifications of the JC models were applied to assess the sensitivity of rate hardening and temperature-dependent strain hardening on mechanical prediction. Numerical results revealed that predicted stress and strain fields were highly sensitive to the rate-dependent term but minimally affected by the temperature-dependent strain hardening. The maximum differences in average stresses and plastic strains were 23% and 13% when comparing results between the JC model and the JC model without strain rate hardening, respectively. Moreover, it was found that strain rate hardening mostly occurred at intermediate temperatures, ≈ 1000 – 1600 K, during the continuous cooling phase. Finally, the present study emphasizes the importance of material constitutive models on mechanical behavior in laser powder bed fusion as well as providing insight for further exploration of process parameter optimization. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Johnson-Cook plasticity model; Laser powder bed fusion; Material constitutive models; Residual stress; Thermomechanical modeling; Ti-6Al-4V alloy","Aluminum alloys; Constitutive models; Elasticity; Laser materials processing; Materials properties; Plastic deformation; Strain hardening; Structural design; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Constitutive materials; Intermediate temperatures; Material constitutive models; Process parameter optimization; Strain-rate hardening; Temperature dependent; Thermo-mechanical behaviors; Thermomechanical model; Strain rate","","","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (80NSSC19M0123); National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA; King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, KMUTT","PP acknowledges support from Research Strengthening Project of the Faculty of Engineering , King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi .

Compared with large amount of previous work on powder spreading on a flat substrate surface before printing, in this article, 3D particulate scale dynamic simulations were carried out to study the spreading of 316 L stainless steel powder during printing by using discrete element method (DEM). The influences of various factors including processing parameters, blade shape, and the powder size on the quality of the spread powder bed were investigated in terms of both macroscopic packing density/uniformity and microstructure/micro dynamics. And optimized condition was identified. The mechanisms were also analyzed based on the powder behavior and forces caused by cooperative interaction between the formed zone (printed part) and the already packed powder layer. The results show that the blade moving speed can seriously influence the quality of the spread powder bed; normally the smaller the blade moving speed, the higher the powder bed quality, but the lower the working efficiency. Therefore, through comprehensive consideration, the proper blade moving speed is chosen to be 0.1 m/s. Increasing the blade gap height or decreasing the particle size (i.e., D = 30 µm) will increase the average relative packing density and structure uniformity. The angle of 15° for the blade is proved to be optimal for excellent powder spreading. Through simulation under optimized parameters, it can be found that the spread powder layer can be more uniform and much denser with high efficiency. And both macroscopic and microscopic analyzes indicate that the spread powder bed has desired structure and property. These findings can improve the fundamental understanding on the powder spreading and provide valuable references for the formation of high quality powder bed during 3D printing. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; DEM modeling; Powder spreading; Selective laser melting; Structure characterization","Additives; Efficiency; Finite difference method; Melting; Particle size; Steel powder metallurgy; 316 L stainless steel; Cooperative interactions; Macroscopic and microscopic; Optimized conditions; Optimized parameter; Processing parameters; Structure and properties; Working efficiency; Selective laser melting","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51374070); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Liaoning Revitalization Talents Program, (XLYC1805007); Liaoning Revitalization Talents Program","The authors are grateful to the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51374070 ) and Liaoning Revitalization Talents Program ( XLYC1805007 ) of China for the financial support of current work.","Hardes C., Pohl F., Rottger A., Thiele M., Theisen W., Esen C., Cavitation erosion resistance of 316L austenitic steel processed by selective laser melting (SLM), Addit.

The effect of laser processing parameter on the growth of nanoparticles was assessed. A combination of low laser power and high scanning speed was conducive to the formation of fine granular nanoparticles with a more uniform distribution. Subsequently, effects of rotation angle between adjacent layers on the compressive deformation behaviour of LPBF-processed NiTi alloys were studied. At a small rotation angle (6–36°), the samples could exhibit an excellent combination of high compressive fracture strength and ductility (e.g. 3094 MPa/39.85%). Meanwhile, samples with small rotation angle tended to get a large strain span for the martensite transformation stage and a large deformation capacity (e.g. 4.64% and 9.25% for θ = 6° and σmax = 800 MPa). © 2021 The Author(s).

The introduction includes the definition of 3D printing, its advantages and examples of practical applications, as well as the reason for undertaking the researches described in the article. The justification of the form of 3D sample models was discussed in detail, as well as the methodology adopted by the authors for comparing the print characteristics and the steps of the printing cycles (print preparation, the course of the printing process and post-processing). A comparison of the materials consumption in the phasess of manual and automatic filament change in the mixer were also described. The test printout was made on the Prusa i3 MK3S printer for filament deposition (FDM or FFF methods). For automatic filament mixing, the Palette 2 Pro device was used. The conclusions also include guidelines for the design and production of models made in one continuous printing cycle (using automatic filament feeding devices). Monolithic elements are less accurate, while elements with replaceable filaments are cheaper, less energy-consuming and the material consumption is lower. © International Journal of Modern Manufacturing Technologies.","3d printing; Filament; Material; Optimization; Reduction of post-processing activities","","","","","","","","Shafiee A., Atala A., Printing technologies for medical applications, Trends in Molecular Medicine, 3, pp. 254-265, (2016); Goole J., Amighi K., 3D printing in pharmaceutics: A new tool for designing customized drug delivery systems, International Journal of Pharmaceutics, 499, pp. 376-394, (2016); Sieminski P., Budzik G., Additive techniques, (2014); Mandrycky C., Wang Z., Kimb K., Kima D-H., 3D bioprinting for engineering complex tissues, Biotechnoly Adv, 34, 4, pp. 422-434, (2016); Ozbolat I.T., Yu Y., Bioprinting toward organ fabrication: challenges and future trends, IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 60, 3, pp. 691-699, (2013); Kordowska M., Choromanska M., Musial W., Plichta J., 3D printing in the automotive industry, Coaches, 16, 6, pp. 123-128, (2015); Plichta J., Plichta S., Computer Integrated Manufacturing, (1999); Konopacki J., The usefulness of consumer 3D printers in FDM technology for creating architectural models, Space and form, 18, pp. 65-80, (2012); Zhang F., Tuck C., Hague R., He Y., Saleh E., Li Y., Sturgess C., Wildman R., Inkjet printing of polyimide insulators for the 3D printing of dielectric materials for microelectronic applications, Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 133, 18, (2016); Carlson A., Bowen A.M., Huang Y., Nuzzo R.G., Rogers J.A., Transfer printing techniques for materials assembly and micro/nanodevice fabrication, Advanced Materials, 24, 2012, pp. 5284-5318, (2012); Burleson S., Baker J., Ting Hsia A., Xu Z., Use of 3D printers to create a patient-specific 3D bolus for external beam therapy, Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics, 16, 3, pp. 166-178, (2015); Murphy S., Atala A., 3D bioprinting of tissues and organs, Nature Biotech, 32, 773, pp. 773-785, (2014); Muzalewska M., Szczodry B., Samolczyk-Wanyura D., Wylezol M., Computer aided and generative technologies in planning the reconstruction of the facial part of the skull, Engineering Modeling, 52, pp. 147-153, (2014); Kromka-Szydek M., Wrona M., Jedrusik-Pawlowska M., Strength analysis of the Unilock 2.4 system used in maxillofacial surgery, Engineering Modeling, 47, pp. 111-122, (2013); van Noort Richard, The future of dental devices is digital, Dental Materials, 28, 2012, pp. 3-12, (2012); Wendeker M., Pietrykowski K., Magryta P., Designing a Wankel injector adapter using the rapid prototyping method, Advances in science and technology, 7, pp. 214-218, (2011); Zenou M., Kotler Z., Printing of metallic 3D micro-objects by laser induced forward transfer, Optical Society of America, 24, 2, pp. 1431-1446, (2016); Lukic M., Clarke J., Tuck C., Whittow W., Wells G., Printability of elastomer latex for additive manufacturing or 3D printing, Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 133, 4, pp. 133-140, (2016); Kowalewski J., Calka R., The usefulness of the 3DP method of rapid prototyping in the process of adapting small arms to firing simulated shots, Military Institute of Armament Technology, 39, 113, pp. 53-62, (2010); Dudek P., FDM 3D printing technology 1 in manufacturing composite elements, Archives of Metallurgy and Materials, 58, pp. 1415-1418, (2013); Fastermann P., 3D-Druck/Rapid Prototyping, (2012); Chua C, Leong K., Lim C., Rapid Prototyping, World Scientific, pp. 124-130, (2003); Czerwinski K., Czerwinski M., 3D printing, (2013); Freedman D., Layer By Layer, Technology Review, pp. 50-53, (2013); Hopkinson N, Dickens P., Emerging Rapid Manufacturing Processe, Rapid Manufacturing; An industrial revolution for the digital age, (2006); Kissling W., Renner R., Zaunseder B., Rapid Prototyping, (2000); Kamrani A., Nasr A., Engineering Design and Rapid Prototyping, pp. 3-22, (2010); Wylezol M., Mazulewska M., Modeling methodology in biomedical engineering with the use of reconstructive engineering, Mechanic.

Design/methodology/approach: Al/Cu bimetallic structure is initially manufactured through laser powder bed fusion process. To minimize trial and error, finite element modeling is adopted to simulate temperature changes on the Al-based and Cu-based substrate. Findings: The results show that forming pure copper on Al-based substrate can guarantee heat accumulation, providing enough energy for subsequent building. The instantaneous laser energy promotes increase of diffusion activation energy, resulting in the formation of transition zone derived from interdiffusion between Al and Cu atoms. The interface with a thickness of about 22 µm dominated by Kirkendall effect moves towards Al-rich side. The interface microstructure is mainly composed of a-Al, a-Cu and CuAl2 phase. Originality/value: The bonding mechanism of Al/Cu interface is atom diffusion-induced chemical reaction. The theoretical basis provides guidance for structural design and production application. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Al/Cu bimetallic structure; Element diffusion; Heat accumulation; Interface; Laser powder bed fusion","Activation energy; Atom lasers; Binary alloys; Chemical bonds; Copper alloys; Diffusion; Microstructure; Structural design; Bimetallic structures; Bonding mechanism; Design/methodology/approach; Diffusion activation energy; Heat accumulation; Interface mi-crostructure; Kirkendall effects; Temperature changes; Aluminum alloys","","","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFC0310400); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","The authors acknowledge funding for this research from National Key Research and Development Program of China (No.2018YFC0310400).","Ahsan M.R.U., Tanvir A.N.M., Ross T., Fabrication of bimetallic additively manufactured structure (BAMS) of low carbon steel and 316L austenitic stainless steel with wire + arc additive manufacturing, Rapid Prototyping Journal, 26, 3, pp. 519-530, (2019); Balla V.K., Bose S., Bandyopadhyay A., Functionally graded Co-Cr-Mo coating on Ti-6Al-4V alloy structure, Acta Biomaterialia, 4, 3, pp. 697-706, (2008); Balogh Z., Schmitz G., 5-Diffusion in metals and alloy, Physical Metallurgy, pp. 387-559, (2014); Dai K., Shaw L., Finite element analysis of the effect of volume shrinkage during laser densification, Acta Materialia, 53, 18, pp. 4743-4754, (2005); Domakh M.S., Baughman J.M., Development of nickel-titanium graded composition components, Rapid Prototyping J, 11, 1, pp. 41-51, (2004); Godecke T., Sommer F., Solidifcation behavior of the Al<sub>2</sub>Cu phase, Z.

There were many researches on natural fibres for 3 Dimensional Printing (3DP) composite material application, but less studies focused on oil palm fibre especially for a part of empty fruit bunch. In some researches, Empty Fruit Bunch (EFB) fibres reinforced with polymer matrix showed the mechanical property improvement in terms of durability, thermal energy and sustainability in manufacturing aerospace and construction parts. Therefore, this research aims to explore the potential of using EFB fibre in additive manufacturing materials as a composite filament. The analysis involved in this research covered one test for thermal properties and two tests for mechanical properties. The tests were Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), tensile strength and shore hardness. The thermal properties result of DSC showed melting temperature (Tm) of (10%EFB fibres + PP) was 162.81°C, while for glass transition, the temperature (Tg) was 147.02°C. In addition, for the evaluation of mechanical properties, tensile strength and shore hardness tests were investigated. The tests showed the results of 33.26MPa and 74.4shore, respectively. Then, the comparison result was done with established filament in 3DP which are polylactide (PLA) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) to investigate the ability. From the comparison result analysis, it showed that (EFB fibres + PP) have the potential as a composite filament because it has the ability equivalent to PLA in terms of thermal and better ability to ABS in terms of shore hardness. © 2021 Seventh Sense Research Group®.","3D printer; Composite material; Oil palm fibre","","","","","","Research Management Center, (GPPS H035); Faculty of Mechanical & Manufacturing Engineering in Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia; Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, UTHM","The authors wish to the Additive Manufacturing Research Group (ADDMAN) at Faculty of Mechanical & Manufacturing Engineering in Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM) and Research Management Center for the financial support to this work and facilitating this work through the GPPS H035.","Abdul H.P.S., Oil Palm Biomass Fibres and Recent Advancement in Oil Palm Biomass Fibres Based Hybrid Biocomposites, Compos.

This article is a feasibility and design study of a launch vehicle whose mission is to shuttle crew and cargo from Low Mars Orbit to a colony on the Martian surface. A single-stage reusable rocket has been selected to fulfil this mission, code-named Charon. The mission profile of such a vehicle was created, leading to a Maximum Growth Allowance (MGA) Delta-V budget of 6.2 km/s. With the mission profile in mind, each subsystem underwent a preliminary design. With reliability and maintainability in mind, subsystems were designed for redundancy and modularity, and an abort system was included for an added level of safety. The iterative design process resulted in a vehicle with a MGA mass of 198.7 tons, capable of transporting 1200 kg of cargo and a crew of 6 people to a 500 km orbit and back. The preliminary design of the vehicle is deemed safe. Following a fault tree analysis, the Single Launch Loss of Mission, Vehicle and Crew (SL-LOM, SL-LOV, SL-LOC) probabilities are computed to be of 0.975%, 0.12%, and 0.079%. Finally, from the vehicle’s constraints on the base, the feasibility of the project has been reflected upon. It is deemed that such a concept is of high interest only when the base is already operational, due to the launch and maintenance infrastructure that it requires, as well as the power it requires from the Martian base. © 2021 by the authors.

Material mixing and elemental diffusion in the transition zone are studied for single scan tracks, hatch scans and multi-layer builds. An adapted recoater enabling powder deposition from multiple sources was utilized to fabricate a more gradual transition zone by alternating material deposition within the build. Homogenization heat treatment enhances elemental diffusion compared to the as-built configuration resulting in a gradual material transition without a distinct interface.

This work aimed to study the effect of α-tricalcium phosphate (α-TCP) and silk fibroin nanofibers (SFF) on CS bone cements. The bone cements were prepared from α-CS hemihydrate (α-CSH), calcium sulfate dihydrate (CSD; as a setting accelerator) and varying α-TCP contents (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25%), with SFF solution or deionized water as the solidification solution at the same liquid/solid ratio. Scanning electron microscopy, particle size distribution, x-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to measure the composition and characterize the properties of the materials. The compressive strength, setting time and weight loss rate of samples were also tested. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. The results suggest that the tuning of α-TCP and SFF has an important role in determining the compressive strength and degradation rate of CS bone cements, and the properties could be changed by varying the content of α-TCP. Moreover, cell experiments showed no toxicity of the samples towards MC3T3 cells. Thus, the materials prepared from α-CSH, CSD, α-TCP and SFF in this work could provide the basis for research into CS-based bone repair materials. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.","","3T3 Cells; Absorbable Implants; Animals; Biomedical Engineering; Bone Cements; Bone Substitutes; Calcium Phosphates; Calcium Sulfate; Cell Proliferation; Compressive Strength; Fibroins; Humans; Materials Testing; Mice; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Nanofibers; Particle Size; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Surface Properties; X-Ray Diffraction; Bone cement; Calcium phosphate; Compressive strength; Degradation; Deionized water; Driers (materials); Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Fracture mechanics; Nanofibers; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Scanning electron microscopy; Setting; Sulfur compounds; Transmission control protocol; Tuning; alpha calcium sulfate hemihydrate; alpha tricalcium phosphate; bone cement; calcium phosphate; calcium sulfate; calcium sulfate dihydrate; deionized water; nanofiber; silk fibroin; unclassified drug; alpha-tricalcium phosphate; bone cement; calcium phosphate; calcium sulfate; fibroin; nanofiber; Bone repair materials; Bone substitutes; Calcium sulfate; Calcium sulfate dihydrate; Degradation rate; Rapid degradation; Tri-calcium phosphates; Weight loss rates; Article; body weight loss; bone remodeling; cell viability assay; chemical composition; compressive strength; controlled study; cytotoxicity; degradation; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; MC3T3 cell line; particle size; scanning electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; 3T3 cell line; adverse device effect; animal; biodegradable implant; biomedical engineering; bone prosthesis; cell proliferation; chemistry; drug effect; human; infrared spectroscopy; materials testing; mouse; surface property; toxicity; ultrastructure; Bone","","calcium phosphate, 10103-46-5, 13767-12-9, 14358-97-5, 7758-87-4; calcium sulfate, 13397-24-5, 23296-15-3, 7778-18-9; fibroin, 9007-76-5; alpha-tricalcium phosphate, ; Bone Cements, ; Bone Substitutes, ; Calcium Phosphates, ; Calcium Sulfate, ; Fibroins, ","","","","","Ruan Z, Yao D, Xu Q, Liu L, Tian Z, Zhu Y, Effects of mesoporous bioglass on physicochemical and biological properties of calcium sulfate bone cements, Appl.

The results show that the original martensitic microstructure in the LPBF sample has converted to a lamellae mixture of α and β phases when post heat-treatment temperatures are below the β-transus (800°C, 850°C and 900°C) with air cooling. On this basis, a good balance of tensile strength and ductility was obtained from sample post heated at 800°C for 6 h followed by air-cooling, with an increase of ~42% in ductility and a significant toughness enhancement (almost 100% increase) compared to the as-built sample. The relationship betweenα lamellaethickness, β volume fraction and post-LPBF heat treatment has been established. Both α lamellae thickness and β volume fraction increase with the heat-treatment temperature. © 2021 Engineers Australia.","charpy properties; ductility; heat treatment; laser powder bed fusion; Ti-6al-4v","Aluminum alloys; Heat treatment; Microstructure; Tensile strength; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Volume fraction; Air cooling; Charpy property; Fusion heat; Heat treatment temperature; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Microstructure control; Powder bed; Property; Ti-6al-4v; Ductility","","","","","CNIC Corporation Ltd.; CNIC Guotong Additive Manufacturing Co.

Utilizing the principle of superposition, the complete thermal history of part-scale builds can be simulated within the time frame required for real physical builds, without spatial or temporal coarsening. Demonstrating the concept on a real component with typical laser powder bed fusion parameters, the simulations show that in addition to power schedule, thermal defects depend on component geometry, scanning strategy, and heat accumulation. The features governing defect formation at the part-scale are analyzed, and a simple rule for predicting defect formation is presented. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","","3D printers; Additives; Coarsening; Forecasting; Component geometries; Defect formation; Defect prediction; Heat accumulation; Principle of superposition; Scanning strategies; Thermal history; Thermal modelling; Defects","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (DGE-1650441); Office of Naval Research, ONR, (0000142012484, 000141712035)","This work was partially supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under Grant No. DGE-1650441 , and ONR under contracts #N000141712035 and #N0000142012484 .

Polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) is commonly used in polymer additive manufacturing due to its controllable transparency, high modulus, and mechanical properties. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) add tensile strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal stability. The increased use of nanocomposites has led to concern over potential human health risks. We assessed morphologic alterations to determine impacts of ingested abraded nanocomposites compared to its component materials, pristine MWCNTs (1000 mg/L) and PETG. Adult transparent Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) were administered materials via oral gavage in 7 doses over 16 days. In vivo observations revealed altered livers and gallbladders following exposure to pristine MWCNTs and nanocomposites. Subsequent histologic sections showed fish exposed to pristine MWCNTs had highly altered biliary structures, and exposure to nanocomposites resulted in hepatocellular alteration. Thyroid follicle proliferation was also observed in fish exposed to materials containing MWCNTs. Transmission electron microscopy of livers showed that hepatocytes of fish exposed to MWCNTs had widespread swelling of rough endoplasmic reticulum, pronounced lysosomal activity, and swelling of intrahepatic biliary passageways. Fish exposed to nanocomposites had areas of degenerated hepatocytes with interspersed cellular debris. Each analysis showed that fish exposed to pristine PETG were most similar to controls. These results suggest that MWCNTs are the source of toxicity in abraded nanocomposite materials but that nanocomposites may also have some unique effects. The similarities of many teleost and mammalian tissues are such that these findings may indicate human health risks. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ingestion; medaka; MWCNT; Nanocomposites; toxicity","Animals; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Nanocomposites; Nanotubes, Carbon; Oryzias; Polymers; glycol; multi walled nanotube; nanocomposite; polyethylene terephthalate; carbon nanotube; polymer; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; electric conductivity; female; gallbladder; health hazard; histopathology; in vivo study; ingestion; liver; liver cell; male; mechanics; nonhuman; Oryzias latipes; rough endoplasmic reticulum; tensile strength; thermostability; three dimensional printing; thyroid follicle; transmission electron microscopy; Young modulus; animal; chemistry; Oryzias","","polyethylene terephthalate, 25038-59-9, 60527-88-0, 9003-68-3; Nanotubes, Carbon, ; Polymers, ","","","US Army Corps of Engineers Research Development Center; National Science Foundation, NSF; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, (DBI-1266252, ECCS-1542015); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA; U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, CPSC; Center for the Environmental Implications of NanoTechnology, CEINT","This work was funded primarily via cooperative agreement W912HZ-17-2-0002 between the US Army Corps of Engineers Research Development Center and the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).

The cell achieves this band-pass response through the use of 20 to 70 elastic layers entrapping layers of viscous fluid. This paper develops and explores a scalable mechanical model of the Pacinian corpuscle and uses the model to predict the response of synthetic corpuscles, which could be the basis for future vibration sensors. The −3dB point of the biological cell is accurately mimicked using the geometries and materials available with off-the-shelf 3D printers. The artificial corpuscles here are constructed using uncured photoresist within structures printed in a commercial stereolithography (SLA) 3D printer, allowing the creation of trapped fluid layers analogous to the biological cell. Multi-layer artificial Pacinian corpuscles are vibration tested over the range of 20–3000 Hz and the response is in good agreement with the model. © 2021 by the authors.

Although these structures are deemed to present advantages over conventional designs in regard to their biological and compressive mechanical properties, their fatigue life has received little attention. In the following work, Ti–6Al–4V lattices based on gyroid, diamond and Schwartz primitive unit-cells were tested in quasi-static tension and tension-tension cyclic fatigue. Their resulting elastic and fatigue properties are reported and compared in the context of biomedical applications. Compared to the two others, the Schwartz lattices were found to have the lowest strength for a similar relative density. The Young's moduli of the three samples however, were of similar magnitude. Basquin's functions are presented to fit the fatigue S–N curves and these can assist with the fatigue design of lattices with identical unit-cells. Fractography analysis from scanning electron microscopy images revealed that the fatigue crack initiation always occurs at the surface, pointing out the importance of surface treatment in SLM-produced titanium lattices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biomedical; Fatigue; Lattices; Selective laser melting; Titanium","3D printers; Biomechanics; Elastic moduli; Fracture mechanics; Medical applications; Scanning electron microscopy; Surface treatment; Tissue engineering; Titanium metallography; Biomedical applications; Compressive mechanical properties; Conventional design; Fatigue crack initiation; Fatigue properties; Metallic lattices; Scanning electron microscopy image; Triply periodic minimal surfaces; Fatigue of materials","","","","","AMPAM; Additive Manufacturing, (IH130100008, IH150100024); Fondation Arts et Métiers; Queensland Centre for Advanced Materials Processing and Manufacturing; Australian Research Council, ARC; University of Queensland, UQ","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the support of Queensland Centre for Advanced Materials Processing and Manufacturing (AMPAM).

In order to provide the reader with sufficient context for the following discussion, the modeling challenge and its underlying cause, as well as current attempts to provide a satisfactory solution, will be discussed. Next, the author will describe two numerical methods (multirate time integration and parallel-in-time) to better represent the temporal scales of the problem. Finally, the results of applying these methods to a two-dimensional version of the heat transfer portion of the LPBF problem will be presented, reporting on both convergence and performance behavior, which indicate the possibility of significant speedup of solution calculations (40–100 times), along with well-characterized effects on solution accuracy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Laser powder bed fusion; Multirate time integration; Parallel-in-time; Temporal multiscale","Numerical methods; Fusion simulation; Multiple time scale; Satisfactory solutions; Solution accuracy; Temporal evolution; Temporal scale; Time integration; Underlying cause; Heat transfer performance","","","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, LLNL, (DE-AC52-07NA27344)","Funding text 1: This research was also supported by the Exascale Computing Project (17-SC-20-SC), a collaborative effort of the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration. ; Funding text 2: This work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.

The value of these filters has been highlighted by the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 crisis where the importance of protective equipment for health care workers cannot be overstated. Three-dimensional (3D) printing of emulsions is an emerging technology built on a well-established field of emulsion templating to produce porous materials such as polymerized high internal phase emulsions (polyHIPEs). PolyHIPE-based porous polymers have tailorable porosity from the submicron to 100 s of μm. Advances in 3D printing technology enables the control of the bulk shape while a micron porosity is controlled independently by the emulsion-based ink. Herein, we present an overview of the current polyHIPE-based filter applications. Then, we discuss the current use of emulsion templating combined with stereolithography and extrusion-based AM technologies. The benefits and limitation of various AM techniques are discussed, as well as considerations for a scalable manufacture of a polyHIPE-based RPE. © 2021 Sherborne and Claeyssens.

Short beam shear (SBS) tests were performed to quantitatively characterize interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of 3D printed continuous and short CFRP composites. Numerical simulations incorporating the extended finite element method (XFEM) and cohesive zone model (CZM) were conducted to rationalize the experiments. Two different combinations of continuous and short carbon fiber reinforcements were studied. The first composite layup made of 48 layers of continuous CFRP filaments was used to determine the intrinsic ILSS of the fully continuous CFRP composites. The second composite layup composed of 24 layers of continuous CFRP filaments and 24 layers of short CFRP filaments was used to determine the ILSS of the continuous and short CFRP composites. The average ILSS of these two composite layups were measured to be about 40.9 MPa and 24.4 MPa, respectively. Four distinct stacking sequences were implemented to examine the effect of stacking sequence of the continuous and short CFRP layers on the ILSS. The ILSS exhibited a significant sensitivity to the stacking sequence. The ILSS tends to increase with the number of the consecutive short CFRP layers. A failure mode transition from a brittle matrix cracking of short CFRP layers to cracking in the interface between the continuous and short CFRP layers was observed. The failure mode transition is attributed to the enhanced fracture strength and toughness of the short CFRP layers due to the increase in layer thickness. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing;

However, the influence of micro-droplet injection characteristics on the forming accuracy and injection regulation strategies is relatively weak during the process of promoting the industrialization of three-dimensional sand printing. Moreover, the practical requirements of precision rapid prototyping of complex sand molds have not been adequately addressed through investigations on the aforementioned influence. A jetting experiment platform is developed herein to optimize the driving waveform of a piezoelectric printhead. On the basis of theoretical simulations and experimental verification, the influence of the printhead waveform on its jetting characteristics is discussed. A method for driving the waveform is presented to improve and optimize the casting sand mold performance. Several case studies are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the optimized driving waveform for enhancing the casting sand mold performance via systematic printing of a standard sand mold test block. Moreover, the optimal driving waveform's contribution to the forming accuracy and efficiency of a large-scale casting sand mold is investigated through experiments using a three-dimensional sand printer. On the basis thereof, the effectiveness of the optimal driving waveform is demonstrated to improve not only the forming accuracy of the sand mold but also the production efficiency. This development can transform the industry of sand casting to produce high-quality castings. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Casting sand mold; Forming accuracy; Micro-droplet injection; Printhead","Casting; Drops; Efficiency; Molds; Piezoelectricity; Sand; Driving waveforms; Experiment platforms; Experimental verification; Forming accuracy; High quality castings; Practical requirements; Production efficiency; Theoretical simulation; 3D printers","","","","","Kocel Machinery Limited; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51965001 0708); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Funding text 1: Funding: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [ 51965001 0708, 2019 ]; and the CAS ""Light of West China"" Program .; Funding text 2: The authors would like to thank Kocel Machinery Limited for experimental equipment and application verification support for the conclusions of this study.

This work analyses the current possibilities and limitations of MAM for plastic injection moulding tool applications, demonstrating the opportunity to limit post-processes to heat treatment and the machining of the MAM insert outer geometry, which was only intended to ensure the assembly of the insert in the injection moulding frame. The results focused on evaluating the as-built insert cavity geometrical characteristics and the dimensional replication performance of the injection moulding process. The as-built cavity surface texture was comparable to a surface roughness that would be alternatively manufactured by electrical discharge machining (EDM). The cavity texture and features was replicated to the plastic injection moulded samples with an average replication fidelity higher than 95 %, enabling the direct production of inserts with integrated enhanced surface properties and aesthetics. Additional geometrical characteristics, such as global cavity dimensions, corner radii, and the staircase effect of selected features, typical of MAM products, were examined to gather further knowledge of the MAM process resolution and the corresponding replication capabilities of the IM process. Additional considerations with regards to the insert mechanical loading conditions and its durability in terms of the expected fatigue lifetime were addressed, verifying the usability of the MAM insert for production batches of at least 2⋅106 injection moulding cycles. Finally, the improvements in terms of lead-time reduction and production costs associated with MAM compared with conventional tooling technologies were evaluated and discussed, confirming the potential of the presented process chain of MAM for injection moulding tools production. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Additive manufacturing; Fatigue; Moulding; Process Chain; Production cost; Surface; Tooling","3D printers; Additives; Costs; Electric discharge machining; Electric discharges; Geometry; Heat treatment; Plastics industry; Surface roughness; Textures; Electrical discharge machining; Finishing operation; Geometrical characteristics; Industrial adoption; Injection moulding tools; Lead time reduction; Mechanical loading; Production batches; Injection molding","","","","","European Union's Horizon 2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie; European Union’s Horizon 2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie; Research and Innovation Action; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (721383, 767589); Innovationsfonden, IFD, (6151-00006B); Università degli Studi di Padova, UNIPD, (BIRD188872/18); Manufacturing Academy of Denmark, MADE","Funding text 1: The work reported in the present article received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie project ‘Precision Additive Metal Manufacturing’ (PAM^2, https://pam2.eu/ , grant agreement no. 721383 ) and the Research and Innovation Action project ‘High Precision Process Chains for the Mass Production of Functional Structured Surfaces’ (ProSurf, http://www.prosurf-project.eu/ , grant agreement no. 767589 ); from the Manufacturing Academy of Denmark (MADE, http://en.made.dk/ ) through the MADE Digital project, Work Package 3 ‘Digital Manufacturing Processes’, funded by Innovation Fund Denmark (grant agreement 6151-00006B ); from the University of Padova , Italy, project Nr.

Several studies have shown that factors such as paretic propulsion can explain between-subjects differences in SLA. However, whether the factors that account for between-subjects variance in SLA are consistent with those that account for within-subjects, stride-by-stride variance in SLA has not been determined. SLA direction is heterogeneous, and different impairments likely contribute to differences in SLA direction. Here, we identified common predictors between-subjects that explain within-subjects variance in SLA using sparse partial least squares regression (sPLSR). We determined whether the SLA predictors differ based on SLA direction and whether predictors obtained from within-subjects analyses were the same as those obtained from between-subjects analyses. We found that for parti-cipants who walked with longer paretic steps paretic double support time, braking impulse, peak vertical ground reaction force, and peak plantarflexion moment explained 59% of the within-subjects variance in SLA. However the within-subjects variance accounted for by each individual predictor was less than 10%. Peak paretic plantarflexion moment accounted for 4% of the within-subjects variance and 42% of the between-subjects variance in SLA. In participants who walked with shorter paretic steps, paretic and non-paretic braking impulse explained 18% of the within-subjects variance in SLA. Conversely, paretic braking impulse explained 68% of the between-subjects variance in SLA, but the association between SLA and paretic braking impulse was in the opposite direction for within-subjects vs. between-subjects analyses. Thus, the relationships that explain between-subjects variance might not account for within-subjects stride-by-stride variance in SLA. © 2001-2011 IEEE.","Dimensionality reduction; Gait; Regression; Step length asymmetry; Stroke","Biomechanical Phenomena; Gait; Humans; Paresis; Stroke; Stroke Rehabilitation; Walking; Biophysics; Ground reaction forces; Sparse partial least squares; Step length; Stroke survivors; Support time; acceleration; adult; aged; analysis of variance; aneurysm rupture; ankle; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; biomechanics; brake reaction time; cerebrovascular accident; controlled study; dimensionality reduction; disease severity; electromyography; female; gait; ground reaction force; hemiparesis; human; kinematics; knee; knee function; male; metatarsophalangeal joint; middle aged; partial least squares regression; phenotype; six minute walk test; step length; stroke survivor; task performance; tendon graft; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale; velocity; walking speed; biomechanics; complication; paresis; stroke rehabilitation; walking; Least squares approximations","","","","","American Heart Association, AHA, (16POST29610000); American Heart Association, AHA; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS, (KL2TR001854); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD, (R01-HD091184); Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD","Manuscript received December 8, 2020; revised April 15, 2021 and June 10, 2021; accepted June 15, 2021.

Thermoplastic materials widely used for rapid prototyping and find application in automobile and aerospace industries due to its simplicity and flexibility in producing functional parts. Pure thermoplastic material having limited mechanical property, one way of improvement is achieved by adjusting the process parameter and the other way is to develop new materials to obtain the desired strength. Carbon fibers are reinforced into plastic material to form thermoplastic matrix carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composites with improved mechanical properties. In this research, mechanical characterizations of 3D printed materials are investigated. Polycarbonate (PC) and PC reinforced with short carbon fibers with the weight fraction of 10% (PC+CF) materials are used. Filaments used for 3D printing are fabricated from plastic pellets and short carbon fiber powder. The effect of reinforcement on tensile properties evaluated experimentally with 3D printed dumbbell specimen. Form this study, it can be concluded that the modulus of elasticity has been increased in PC+CF compared with PC. Also, Field Emission SEM analysis is performed on fractured surfaces for observing the distribution of fiber and interface of fibers in the matrix. © 2021.

The surface pores in both simplified semi-ellipsoid/spheroid and more realistic triangular shapes were evaluated in the first place. Stress concentration factor Kt analyzed by ABAQUS and fatigue life assessed by FE-SAFE were closely related to the AM 3D pore size, shape, position, orientation as well as their interactions, which confirmed their effects on the crack initiation stage during fatigue testing. The effectiveness of adding a surface finish factor Kt to a smooth surface fatigue model was subjected to internal pore geometry in terms of Kt values ranging from 1 to 5.5. Different algorithms were attempted with the stress-life method giving a higher estimation than a strain-life method while becoming invalid when the stress concentration situation was rather serious (around Kt = 2.5). There was no much difference between the uniaxial and multi-axial fatigue algorithms because the uniaxial tensile cyclic loading was applied to the model. Theoretically calculated total fatigue life (crack propagation) using linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) fell in the same order as the experimental results for all the samples (within a factor of 2). AMed material parameters were used for the fatigue life prediction where the microstructure element was counted. AMed pores could deteriorate the mechanical properties of the AMed materials a lot, such as strength, Young's modulus and fatigue lifetime, etc. The statistical analysis showed the scatter band of the SN curves at a factor of 8 with respect to different laser scanning speeds. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","ASTM A131 (EH36) steel; Fatigue life; Modelling; Selective laser melting; Surface porosity","Additives; Cracks; Elastic moduli; Fatigue testing; Fracture mechanics; Numerical methods; Pore size; Selective laser melting; Stress concentration; Well testing; Fatigue life prediction; Laser scanning speed; Linear-elastic fracture mechanics; Microstructure elements; Multi-axial fatigue; Selective laser melting (SLM); Stress concentration factors; Total fatigue lives; Fatigue of materials","","","","","National Research Foundation; Singapore Centre for 3D Printing; National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF; Nanyang Technological University, NTU","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Singapore Centre for 3D Printing, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

The testing procedures of pieces made in FDM machines do not yet have any conclusive standards because 3D printing, as a disruptive and exponentially growing technology, has not allowed enough time to reach a definitive scientific consensus. Nowadays, testing standards for injected thermoplastic parts or laminated composites are employed as substitutes with careful implementation. A comparative study was carried out on the elasticity modulus, determined within the framework of the same standard but with different measuring devices and testing machines. These machines cover a broad range from professional automated high precision machines to lab and specialized machines. Sets of 3D-printed specimens with identical manufacturing parameters were constructed in a commercial 3D printer. An analysis of variance was performed in order to evaluate the consistency and significance of experimental data for the same polymer, considering the machine type and its corresponding setup. From the experimental data, it is concluded that, with the due care, all evaluated testing setups can reach comparable results, especially in the absence of sophisticated and expensive measuring systems. © 2021, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

The antenna array is based on glide-symmetric holey gap-waveguide technology combined with E-plane insertion gaps for a low-cost and low-loss design. The radiating part of the antenna array is formed by an array of 16 aperture antennas, grouped in four sets of 2× 2 antenna subarrays in E-plane configuration. The 2× 2 subarrays are fed by a one-to-four corporate feeding network in E-plane with holey gap-waveguide technology. The antenna array has been manufactured with high precision stereolithography (SLA) and subsequent metal plating. This design procedure yields a low-cost and low-weight manufacturing process for functional prototypes. The complete array has been manufactured and measured, by comparing its performance with the simulation results. Measurements show an input reflection coefficient below-10 dB which ranges from 68 to 74 GHz. The measured radiation patterns suit adequately the defined ones in the design stage. Moreover, gain above 19 dBi in the entire operating frequency band is achieved with a mean antenna efficiency of 74.1%.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Aperture antenna array; gap-waveguide technology; millimeter-wave; stereolithography (SLA)","Antenna feeders; Costs; Directional patterns (antenna); Microwave antennas; Millimeter waves; Plating; Waveguides; Antenna efficiency; Aperture antennas; E-plane waveguide; Functional Prototypes; Input reflection coefficient; Manufacturing process; Millimeter-wave band; Operating frequency bands; Antenna arrays","","","","","Spanish Program of Research, Development, and Innovation, (EQC2018-004988-P, RTI2018-102002-A-I00, TIN2016-75097-P); Junta de Andalucía, (B-TIC-402-UGR18, FPU18/01965, P18.RT.4830)","Manuscript received May 27, 2019; revised May 15, 2020; accepted June 14, 2020.

However, the effect of this anisotropy on the alloy machinability is rarely considered and a deeper understanding is needed. In the current study, Ti6Al4V prisms were fabricated by laser powder bed fusion in both vertical and horizontal orientation. After heat treatment, the prisms were slot milled at different cutting parameters to assess the influence of the build-up orientation on the surface quality, focusing on the surface topography. The results show that the skewness parameter can distinguish the machined surface of differently oriented AM parts and that the horizontal orientation allows for better machinability when considering the burrs height and the chip morphology. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Additive manufacturing;

The contact pressure, defined as the pressure applied by the newly deposited layer onto the previous layer, is experimentally calculated as the difference between the pressure during printing and open discharge at the same volumetric flow rates. An analytical method for estimating the contact pressure, assuming one-dimensional steady isothermal flow, is derived for the Newtonian, power-law, and Cross model dependence of shear rates. A design of experiments was performed to characterize the contact pressure as a function of the road width, road height, and print speed. Statistical analysis of the results suggests that the contribution of the pressure driven flow is about twice that of the drag flow in determining contact pressure, which together describe about 60% of the variation in the observed contact pressure behavior. Modeling of the elastic and normal stresses at the nozzle orifice explains an additional 30% of the observed behavior, indicating that careful rheological modeling is required to successfully predict contact pressure.  © 2020 Author(s).","","Design of experiments; Fabrication; Nozzles; Roads and streets; Shear flow; Analytical method; Contact pressures; Fabrication process; High impact polystyrene; Non-Newtonian models; Pressure-driven flows; Rheological modeling; Volumetric flow rate; Non Newtonian flow","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1914651)","","Kwon T., Shen S., Wang K., Pressure drop of polymeric melts in conical converging flow: Experiments and predictions, J.

The basic unit cell consisted of rectangular dielectric blocks (RDB) placed onto a thin substrate, realized by means of a resin polymer. The RDB effective relative permittivity was changed by tuning specific design parameters and infill density percentage (ID%), that was engineered through the introduction of a number of uniformly distributed micro-air channels. The reflected phase variation was numerically quantified in terms of frequency range and ID%, thus proving that a controlled phase variation can be accomplished depending on air-channel number. The prototypes were fabricated by means of the micro-inverted Stereolithography (SLA). In order to assess the accuracy of the SLA technology on the dimensions imposed by the high aspect ratio of the structures, larger unit cells operating in the X band were first fabricated. The acquired technological know-how has been subsequently exploited to fabricate smaller unit cells operating at mmwave. Geometrical characterizations of the prototypes, performed via a visual system setup, put in evidence the technological challenges, especially faced to realize open micro-air channels. In particular, as smaller micro-channel were actually obtained for some samples, a consequent increase of the actual ID% and effective relative permittivity values was experienced by the related unit cells. Nonetheless, the experimental results performed on the fabricated prototypes in the X band and mmwave range were in good agreement with the numerical ones, confirming the phase variation vs. ID% trends of the simulated unit cell arrays.  © 2013 IEEE.","5G communications; additive manufacturing; antenna arrays; antenna measurements; layered manufacturing; millimeter wave communication; reflectarray; smart surfaces; stereolithography; vision systems","5G mobile communication systems; Aspect ratio; Cells; Cytology; Fabrication; Millimeter wave devices; Millimeter waves; Permittivity; Phase control; Technology transfer; Design parameters; Fabrication and characterizations; Frequency ranges; High aspect ratio; Micro air-channels; Mm-wave application; Relative permittivity; Technological challenges; 3D printers","","","","","","","Xiao M., Mumtaz S., Huang Y., Dai L., Li Y., Matthaiou M., Karagiannidis G.K., Bjornson E., Yang K., Chih-Lin I., Ghosh A., Millimeter wave for future mobile networks, IEEE J.

With the right formulation and printing parameters, bioinks can provide native biological and mechanical cues while allowing for versatile 3D structures that recapitulate tissue-level organization. Bio-based materials that support cellular adhesion, differentiation, and proliferation - including gelatin, collagen, hyaluronic acid, and alginate - have been successfully used as bioinks. In particular, decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) has become a promising material with the unique ability to maintain both biochemical and topographical micro-environments of native tissues. However, dECM has shown technical limitations for 3D printing (3DP) applications posed by its intrinsically low mechanical stability. Herein, we report hydrogel bioinks composed of partially digested, porcine cardiac decellularized extracellular matrix (cdECM), Laponite-XLG nanoclay, and poly(ethylene glycol)-diacrylate (PEG-DA). The Laponite facilitated extrusion-based 3DP, while PEG-DA enabled photo-polymerization after printing. Improving upon previously reported bioinks derived from dECM, our bioinks combine extrudability, shape fidelity, rapid cross-linking, and cytocompatibility in a single formulation (> 97% viability of encapsulated human cardiac fibroblasts and > 94% viability of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes after 7 days). The compressive modulus of the cured hydrogel bioinks was tunable from 13.4-89 kPa by changing the concentration of PEG-DA in the bioink formulation. Importantly, this span of mechanical stiffness encompasses ranges of tissue stiffness from healthy (compressive modulus ~5-15 kPa) to fibrotic (compressive modulus ~30-100 kPa) cardiac tissue states. The printed constructs demonstrated shape fidelity, adaptability to different printing conditions, and high cell viability following extrusion and photo-polymerization, highlighting the potential for applications in modeling both healthy and fibrotic cardiac tissue. © 2020","3D bioprinting; Bioinks; Cardiac tissue engineering; Decellularized extracellular matrix; Direct-ink writing","Animals; Bioprinting; Extracellular Matrix; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Ink; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Swine; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; 3D printers; Cell culture; Cell engineering; Extrusion; Heart; Histology; Hyaluronic acid; Mechanical stability; Nanocomposites; Photopolymerization; Polyethylene glycols; Scaffolds (biology); Stem cells; Tissue; hydrogel; laponite xlg nanoclay; poly(ethylene glycol)diacrylate; unclassified drug; ink; 3d bioprinting; Bioink; Bioprinting; Cardiac tissue engineering; Decellularized; Decellularized extracellular matrix; Direct-ink writing; Extracellular matrices; Laponites; Nano clays; animal tissue; Article; biochemical composition; cardiac muscle cell; cell encapsulation; cell survival; cell transdifferentiation; cell viability; comparative study; controlled study; cross linking; decellularization; engineered heart tissue; extracellular matrix; heart fibroblast; human; human cell; induced pluripotent stem cell; nonhuman; pig; polymerization; priority journal; rigidity; robocasting; three dimensional bioprinting; animal; bioprinting; extracellular matrix; induced pluripotent stem cell; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; Hydrogels","","","","","Ministry of Health & Welfare; University of Washington Royalty Research Fund; National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01HL94388, R01NS094388, UG3TR003271, UH3TR003519); National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI, (R01HL146436); National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI; Ministry of Health and Welfare, MOHW, (HI19C0642); Ministry of Health and Welfare, MOHW; Korea Health Industry Development Institute, KHIDI","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health grants R01HL146436 , R01HL94388 , R01NS094388 , UG3TR003271 , UH3TR003519 (to D.-H.K.) and the University of Washington Royalty Research Fund (to A.N.).

Design/methodology/approach: A series of plain and twill weave fabrics are designed using computer-aided design software Solidworks and printed using fused deposition modeling machines to determine the best model that could be printable. The structures were designed in such a way that the fabricated yarns with pure (PLA) were not sticking to each other in the fabric structure. The specimens were printed in vertical orientation and then tensile and three-point bending (flexural) tests were conducted for twill weave fabrics. Findings: The tests showed that the mechanical strength was higher in the warp direction than in the weft direction. This difference was because of printing of continuous filament-like yarns in the warp direction and staple-like yarns in the weft direction. This orthotropic property of the material was verified by analyzing its microscopic structures via optical microscope. Research limitations/implications: Future work should include improvement of the structure and exploration of different polymers and their composites to increase the tensile, bending and other strengths to make the 3D-printed structures more flexible and stronger. Future research should also focus on the large-scale manufacturing of 3D printed fabrics. Practical implications: This paper supports work on wearable 3D-printed fabrics. The 3D-printed fabric will also contribute to new applications and products such as liquid filters. Originality/value: The research done in this work is new and original. This paper contributes to new knowledge by providing a better understanding of polymers and their 3D printing capabilities to form a complex fabric structure. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing (AM); Fabrics; Fused deposition modeling (FDM); Polylactic acid (PLA); Textiles; Yarns","Additives; Bending dies; Bending strength; Bending tests; Composite structures; Computer aided design; Fused Deposition Modeling; Industrial research; Polymers; Textile printing; Yarn; Computer-aided design software; Continuous filaments; Deposition modeling; Design/methodology/approach; Large-scale manufacturing; Microscopic structures; Orthotropic properties; Three point bending; Weaving","","","","","Auburn University, AU","Funding: This research is funded by Auburn University, Department of Mechanical Engineering, which is appreciated.","Adanur S., Wellington Sears Handbook of Industrial Textiles, (1995); Adanur S., Handbook of Weaving, (2001); Adanur S., Liao T., 3D modeling of textile composite preforms, Composites Part B: Engineering, 29, 6, pp. 787-793, (1998); Adanur S., Vakalapudi J., Woven fabric design and analysis in 3D virtual reality.

Wood and cellulose-based materials have recently drawn a lot of attention for use as 3D printing materials due to their unique properties such as environmental friendliness, cost-effectiveness and abundancy. However, because these compounds are derived from various natural sources, their different particle sizes can result in low 3D printing quality. The objective of this study is to resolve the mentioned deficiencies in the packaging industry by designing a novel 3D printer nozzle based on the material extrusion method (FDM technique), which provides higher printing speed and enhanced quality for wood and cellulose-based materials. The packaging industry can significantly benefit from 3D printing technology for cellulose-based materials by producing high-quality recyclable economical packaging on a large scale according to the clients' demand. The proposed nozzle design enables selecting different geometrical cross-sections of the nozzle dies and any number of extrusion points along the nozzle die simultaneously during the 3D printing process. These capabilities lead to advanced performance and improved speed of 3D printing in large scale manufacturing. The proposed nozzle design provides a novel technique for 3D printing of plant-derived compounds with remarkable advantages such as providing selective variable extrusion and multiple nozzle dies. Compared to other existing 3D printing techniques, the proposed nozzle abilities make it a promising option with higher speed and better functionality for the packaging industry. © 2013 IEEE.","3D printer nozzle; 3D printing; cellulose-based materials; extrusion technique; packaging industry; wood printing","Cellulose; Cost Effectiveness; Extrusion; Packaging Materials; Printing Machines; Cellulose; Cost effectiveness; Extrusion; Frequency division multiplexing; Nozzle design; Packaging; Packaging materials; Printing presses; Wood; 3D printing process; Additive manufacturing technology; Cellulose based materials; Different particle sizes; Environmental friendliness; Large scale productions; Large-scale manufacturing; Manufacturing industries; 3D printers","","","","","New Art of Reason; Business Finland","This work was supported by the New Art of Reason (NewArea) - Business Finland.","Berman B., 3-D printing: The new industrial revolution, Bus.

Samples were prepared by the tilt angle of a re-entrant pattern of 0o, 30o, 45o, 60o and 90o, and then analyzed using Poisson's ratio, bending, compression, and tensile properties. A 3D printed auxetic re-entrant pattern (3DP-RE) and its composite fabric (3DP-RE/NP) showed a negative Poisson's ratio in all tilting angles that indicated auxetic properties. The results of the bending property shown that strength of 3DP-RE/NP was 1.5 times lower than NP, but the strain improved 2.0 times. It was confirmed that the deformation of 3DP-RE/NP is possible with a low load. Each sample type of compression behavior indicated similar regardless of the tilting angles; in addition, the compression toughness of 3DP-RE/NP increased 1.2 times compared with NP. In the case of tensile properties, 3DP-RE and 3DP-RE/NP were affected by the tilting angle, samples with 90o (the opposite of load direction) showed best tensile property and toughness. 3DP-RE/NP indicated improved bending, compression, and tensile properties. © 2021, Journal of the Korean Society of Clothing and Textiles All Rights Reserved.","Auxetic re-entrant pattern; Fused deposition modeling 3D printing; Mechanical property; Neoprene; Tilting angle","","","","","","","","AlMaadeed M.

The component was made of Inconel 718 and produced by laser powder bed fusion 3D printing technology. The digital tool was utilised to compensate the original design geometry by pre-distortion of its original geometry using the developed mathematical model.

It detects the formation of an island at the connection point and disconnects the DG to protect the unit, the system and the personnel. The increased penetration of inverter-interfaced DG, in combination with the decommissioning of synchronous generators, reduces the system inertia and leads to faster changing and larger voltage and frequency deviations. Therefore, modern grid-codes require inverter-based DGs to provide support to the grid by modifying their active and reactive power injection based on local measurements. However, this leads to complex inverter-grid interactions and modifies the islanded system behavior, thus disturbing the operation of LoM protections that rely mainly on local voltage and frequency measurements. In this paper, we propose an improved analytical formulation for estimating the Non-Detection Zone (NDZ) of LoM protection devices in the presence of grid-feeding inverters, as well as novel NDZ approximations for grid-supporting and grid-forming inverter-based services. We verify the analytical results with detailed dynamic simulations and comment on the impact that the new inverter requirements have on the performance of LoM protections. © 2020","Analytical approximation; Grid-following; Grid-forming; Loss of mains; Non-detection zone","Distributed power generation; Electric equipment protection; Active and Reactive Power; Analytical formulation; Analytical results; Distributed generator (DGs); Frequency deviation; Frequency measurements; Islanding detection; Non detection zones; Electric inverters","","","","","","","IEEE Standard for interconnection and interoperability of distributed energy resources with associated electric power systems interfaces, IEEE Std 1547–2018 (Revision of IEEE Std 1547–2003), (2018); Velasco D., Trujillo C., Garcera G., Figueres E., Review of anti-islanding techniques in distributed generators, Renew.

This type of molds presents several disadvantages: have a high cost; need a long time for their manufacture; involve the use of release agents during the demolding operation. As an alternative, the use of molds manufactured by fused deposition modeling is proposed. These 3D printed molds have a poor surface finish, which complicates the demolding operation. To overcome this handicap, materials that can be chemically polished have been studied: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and high impact polystyrene. Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene can be polished by exposure to acetone vapors and high impact polystyrene by immersion in limonene. This post-processing operation allows to reduce the surface roughness of the 3D printed mold. To simulate the industrial use of the mold, seven molding-demolding cycles have been performed. To measure the ease of demolding of each material, a pull-off test has been used. The results indicate that high impact polystyrene has less affinity with polyurethane foam than acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. In addition, although release agent is used in cycle 1, with high impact polystyrene specimens, it is not necessary to use it in cycles 2, 3 and 4; this means a saving of release agent. Furthermore, the chemical polishing of high impact polystyrene by immersion in limonene has several advantages: it is performed in a short time; it allows to obtain an excellent finish regardless of the initial surface roughness; it is done using a biodegradable solvent of organic origin. To experimentally demonstrate the viability of the proposed solution, a mold for the back of a car seat has been printed in high impact polystyrene via fused deposition modeling and chemically polished by immersion in limonene (1 min); the geometrical deviations generated were less than 1 mm. © 2021 CIRP","3D printing; ABS; Chemical polishing; FDM; HIPS; Mold; Pull-off test; PUR foam; Rapid tooling; Release-agent; Surface roughness","Acetone; Automobile manufacture; Butadiene; Chemical polishing; Deposition; Fused Deposition Modeling; Layered manufacturing; Monoterpenes; Polystyrenes; Polyurethanes; Rigid foamed plastics; Styrene; Surface roughness; Acetone vapors; Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene; Geometrical deviations; High impact polystyrene; Organic origin; Polyurethane Foam; Post processing; Surface finishes; Molds","","","","","Universidad de Córdoba","This research was funded by University of Cordoba , through its Plan Propio de Investigación (2018–2020).

Applications of bioprinting using plant or algae cells include the production of metabolites for use in pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries. Reported studies regarding effects of extrusion pressure and needle diameter on cell viability in bioprinting have used animal cells. There are no reports regarding effects of extrusion pressure and needle diameter on cell viability using plant or algae cells. This paper fills this knowledge gap by reporting an experimental investigation on effects of extrusion pressure and needle diameter on cell quantity (an indicator of cell viability) in extrusion-based bioprinting of hydrogel-based bioink containing Chlamydomonas reinhardtii algae cells. Extrusion pressure levels used in this study were 3, 5, and 7 bar, and needle diameter levels were 200, 250, and 400 µm. Algae cell quantity in printed samples was measured on the third day and sixth day post bioprinting. Results show that, when extrusion pressure increases or needle diameter decreases, algae cell quantity in printed samples decreases.

Here, inspired by the three-dimensional crystalline microstructure of selective laser melted (SLM) Al–Si alloy, a type of novel cellular structure with irregular nodes and struts was designed and fabricated by the SLM process with Al–Si alloy powder. The as-fabricated cellular structures were multi-scale materials from nano- to macro-scale. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis revealed that compared with the edge region, the central region of the struts had larger grain size, dominant (001) grain orientation, and worse toughness. Most importantly, compared with the regular lattice structures, the novel cellular structures brought about maximum 32.8% and 38.3% improvement in volumetric energy absorption Wv and specific energy absorption Ws, respectively. Furthermore, the finite element simulation was employed to reveal the stress distribution and energy absorption mechanism of cellular components during compression. Finally, the different fracture modes between the edge and central regions of the struts were investigated. The Al–Si crystalline microstructure inspired cellular structures have potential applications in biomaterials, vibration and thermal insulation. © 2020 CIRP","Additive manufacturing; Al–Si crystalline microstructure; Cellular structures; Compressive properties; Finite element simulation; Selective laser melting","Additives; Cellular automata; Cellular manufacturing; Energy absorption; Microstructure; Nanocrystalline materials; Silicon alloys; Struts; Thermal insulation; Absorption mechanisms; Cellular components; Complex configuration; Compressive performance; Electron back scatter diffraction; Finite element simulations; Laser additive manufacturing; Specific energy absorption; 3D printers","","","","","Excellent Scientific and Technological Innovation Teams of Universities in Jiangsu; National Key Research and Development Program ?; Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province, (KYCX20_0194); Six Talents Peaks” Innovative Talents Team Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51735005); Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFB1100101, 2018YFB1106302); Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, (51921003, TD-GDZB-001); Program for Jiangsu Excellent Scientific and Technological Innovation Team","Funding text 1: We are grateful for the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51735005 ); National Key Research and Development Program “Additive Manufacturing and Laser Manufacturing” (Nos. 2016YFB1100101 , 2018YFB1106302 ); National Natural Science Foundation of China for Creative Research Groups (Grant No. 51921003 ); The 15th Batch of “Six Talents Peaks” Innovative Talents Team Program “Laser Precise Additive Manufacturing of Structure-Performance Integrated Lightweight Alloy Components” (No. TD-GDZB-001 ); 2017 Excellent Scientific and Technological Innovation Teams of Universities in Jiangsu “Laser Additive Manufacturing Technologies for Metallic Components” funded by Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education of China ; Jiankai Yang thanks the financial support from Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (No. KYCX20_0194 ).; Funding text 2: We are grateful for the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51735005); National Key Research and Development Program ?Additive Manufacturing and Laser Manufacturing?

We have demonstrated this by introducing ø0.5 mm pores in the CAD file (totalling 0.5% by volume) and measuring a threefold increase in argon content, versus an identical IN718 build-job without pores. For critical applications where the material is subjected to cyclic loading, any defects can act as stress raisers and initiate cracks. The pores that were introduced drastically reduced the fatigue performance of said material. However, after Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP), the material regained its properties as if the pores were never introduced. Still, the argon remains after HIP according to measurements as it lacks solubility and thus cannot leave the material. Worth noting is that a small quantity of argon originates from gas-atomisation of the powder and thus does not leave entirely during the remelting in L-PBF. © 2021 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining Published by Taylor & Francis on behalf of the Institute.","additive manufacturing; argon; fatigue; hot isostatic pressing; IN718; pores","Fatigue of materials; Hot isostatic pressing; Protective atmospheres; Stress analysis; Artificial porosity; CAD files; Critical applications; Fatigue performance; Gas atomisation; Laser powders; Stress raisers; Argon lasers","","","","","Quintus Technologies AB; Swedish Government; VINNOVA, (2020-04408); VINNOVA","Funding text 1: Linde AG and Quintus Technologies AB are acknowledged for funding of the study.

The main trends for bioink applications and the primary considerations guiding the selection and design of current bioink components (i.e., cell types, hydrogels, and additives) were reviewed. The cost, availability, practicality, and basic biological considerations (e.g., cytocompatibility and cell attachment) are the most popular parameters guiding bioink use and development. Today, extrusion bioprinting is the most widely used bioprinting technique. The most reported use of bioinks is the generic characterization of bioink formulations or bioprinting technologies (32%), followed by cartilage bioprinting applications (16%). Similarly, the cell-type choice is mostly generic, as cells are typically used as models to assess bioink formulations or new bioprinting methodologies rather than to fabricate specific tissues. The cell-binding motif arginine-glycine-aspartate is the most common bioink additive. Many articles reported the development of advanced functional bioinks for specific biomedical applications; however, most bioinks remain the basic compositions that meet the simple criteria: Manufacturability and essential biological performance. Alginate and gelatin methacryloyl are the most popular hydrogels that meet these criteria. Our analysis suggests that present-day bioinks still represent a stage of emergence of bioprinting technology. © 2021 Pedroza-González, et al.

Although new bioprinting methods are emerging (e.g. contactless and volumetric bioprinting), micro-extrusion bioprinting remains the most widely used method. Micro-extrusion bioprinting, however, is still largely dependent on the conventional pneumatic extrusion process, which relies heavily on homogenous biomaterial inks and bioinks to maintain a constant material flow rate. Augmenting the functionality of the bioink with the addition of nanoparticles, cells or biopolymers can induce inhomogeneities resulting in uneven material flow during printing and/or clogging of the nozzle, leading to defects in the printed construct. In this work, we evaluated a novel extrusion technique based on a miniaturized progressive cavity pump (PCP) which allows precise control over the volumetric flow rate by positive displacement. We compared the accuracy and precision of this system to the pneumatic extrusion system and tested both systems for their effect on cell viability after extrusion. The PCP achieved a significantly higher accuracy and precision compared to the pneumatic system, while maintaining good viability. These improvements were independent of the bioink composition, printing speed or nozzle size. This study demonstrates the merit of precise extrusion-process control in bioprinting by PCPs and investigates their influence on process-induced cell damage. PCPs are a promising tool for bioprinting and could help provide standardized and validated bioprinted constructs while leaving the researcher more freedom in the design of the bioinks.  © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.","alginate; bioprinting; gelatin; gellan gum; micro-extrusion bioprinting; pneumatic extrusion; progressive cavity pump","Bioprinting; Ink; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; Biopolymers; Controlled drug delivery; Extrusion; Nozzles; Pneumatics; Tissue engineering; ink; Accuracy and precision; Controlled extrusions; Extrusion process; Extrusion techniques; Positive displacement; Progressive cavity pump(PCP); Progressive cavity pumps; Volumetric flow rate; bioprinting; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; Process control","","","","","","","Vijayavenkataraman S, Yan W C, Lu W F, Wang C H, Fuh J Y H, 3D bioprinting of tissues and organs for regenerative medicine, Adv.

This study aims to discuss and presents the current role of 3D-printed phantoms and devices for organ-specified applications in urology. The discussion started with a literature search regarding the two mentioned topics within PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and EBSCOhost databases. 3D-printed urological organ phantoms are reported for providing residents new insight regarding anatomical characteristics of organs, either normal or diseased, in a tangible manner. Furthermore, 3D-printed organ phantoms also helped urologists to prepare a pre-surgical planning strategy with detailed anatomical models of the diseased organs. In some centers, 3DP technology also contributed to developing specified devices for disease management. To date, urologists have been benefitted by 3D-printed phantoms and devices in the education and disease management of organs of in the genitourinary system, including kidney, bladder, prostate, ureter, urethra, penis, and adrenal. It is safe to say that 3DP technology can bring remarkable changes to daily urological practices. © 2021 Agung, et al.

To understand the effect of sample position on the build-plate (substrate) with respect to shrinkage and dimensional deviation, 36 samples in a 6 × 6 array were printed with three repetitions. The value of the diameter was measured at 10 points along the vertical axis in the perpendicular and parallel directions to the flow of the assisted gas. The results of the experiment show that there is shrinkage in both directions with respect to the gas flow. However, the extent of deviation in the perpendicular direction to the gas flow is greater compared to the parallel diameters for the samples. This can be related to the pressure of assisted gas and the difference in cooling rate corresponding to the position of the samples on the building substrate. The hypothesis is proved by conducting further experiments regulating the amount of gas flow by adjusting the individual nozzle for the gas flow to the build chamber. The reason for these deviations is speculated to be related to the rheology of the melt pool. This research could lay a solid foundation for the future development of a compensation strategy to nullify the effect of shrinkage and dimensional deviations on parts made using the laser powder-bed fusion technique. The results of shrinkage of the columns appear to suggest that there is an effect on the circularity from the assisting gas. © 2020 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Assist gas pressure; Dimensional deviations; Grain size; Powder bed fusion","Flow of gases; Gases; Shrinkage; Assisting gas; Compensation strategy; Dimensional deviation; Fusion techniques; Laser powders; Sample position; Stainless steel 316; Stainless steel 316L; Austenitic stainless steel","","","","","","","Gibson I., Et al., Additive manufacturing technologies, (2020); King W.E., Et al., Laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing of metals; physics, computational, and materials challenges, Appl Phys Rev, 2, 4, (2015); Khorasani A.M., Et al., Production of Ti-6Al-4V acetabular shell using selective laser melting: possible limitations in fabrication, Rapid Prototyp J, 23, 1, (2017); Rupal B.S., Et al., Geometric tolerance and manufacturing assemblability estimation of metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes, (2020); Ameta G., Et al., Tolerance specification and related issues for additively manufactured products, ASME 2015 international design engineering technical conferences and computers and information in engineering conference, (2015); Alvarez P., Et al., Computationally efficient distortion prediction in powder bed fusion additive manufacturing, Int.

Even when machinery is adopted to support manufacturing operations, in most cases an operator has to supervise or carry out the task. On the other hand, craft footwear industries are called to respond to continuous challenges to face the globalization effects, so that a rapid adaptability to customer needs is required. The industry 4.0 paradigms, which are taking place in the industrial environments, represent an excellent opportunity to improve the efficiency and quality of production, and a way to face international competitors. This paper analyses and proposes a robotic cell to automatize the process of glue deposition on shoe upper, which exploits a new means of depositing the glue compared to State-of-Art applications. While the latter mainly adopt glue gun spraying systems or pneumatic syringes, the proposed robotic cell is based on an extrusion system for the deposition of molten material originally in the form of a filament, similar to all extent to those adopted for Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). Two cell solutions are designed and tested. In the former the extruder is the robot end effector and the shoe upper is grounded to the cell frame. In the second, being the reciprocal, the shoe last is clamped to the robot wrist and the extruder is fixed to the cell frame. The peculiarities of the two solutions are pointed out and compared in terms of cell layout, hardware, programming software and possibility to develop collaborative applications. A self developed slicing software allows designing the trajectories for glue deposition based on the CAD model of the shoe upper, also allowing driving the inclination of the extruder nozzle with respect to the vectors normal to the upper surface. Both the proposed cell layouts permit to achieve good quality and production times. The solution with the mobile extruder is able to deposit glue at highest end-effector speed (up to 200 mm/s). On the other hand, the solution with the mobile shoe upper and fixed extruder seems to be more appropriate to enhance collaborative applications. © 2020 by the authors.

The current focus on productivity enhancement of additive manufacturing has imposed the implementation of multiple-laser systems with larger scan fields. Its usage, combined with adequate layer thickness and laser power selection, makes high-volume parts less challenging to obtain. This paper focuses on understanding the influence of using multiple-scan fields for the fabrication of large components, especially on the parts region corresponding to scan field interface. The microstructure as well as mechanical behaviour of the multi-field manufactured samples are compared with parts fabricated using a single-field, for distinct processing parameters. Moreover, given the unreliability of additive manufacturing regarding dimensional and geometrical tolerances with increasing build rates, post-processing metal-cutting operations were studied towards additive manufacturing process hybridization. Despite the typical additive manufacturing process variability, a set of parameters, within testing conditions, could be identified as the most appropriate solution towards mechanical strength enhancement. Nonetheless, porosity levels can significantly impact the ductility of parts, which may be additionally compromised by its occurrence in the scan-field interface region. © IMechE 2020.","ductility; Laser powder bed fusion; machinability; productivity enhancement","3D printers; Additives; Metal cutting; 316 L stainless steel; Additive manufacturing process; Cutting operations; Geometrical tolerances; Mechanical behaviour; Processing parameters; Productivity enhancement; Strength enhancement; Austenitic stainless steel","","","","","National Funds; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER; Programa Operacional Temático Factores de Competitividade, POFC","The projects ‘MAMTool – Machinability of Additive Manufactured Parts for Tooling Industry’ (Ref.

In Industries product are produced by wasting one third of its material, from this process time consumption and material wastage is more comparing in Subtractive Manufacturing over Additive Manufacturing. Additive Manufacturing stepped from 1925 in manufacturing industry and it has gained its remarkable growth in past few decades, as of now metal 3D oriented parts have come to play a major role in aerospace industry. This research work focused on Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) welding. It has high deposition rate, ultimate build volume and good structural integrity compare with other additive manufacturing process. MACH3 controller is used to control the welding torch motion for addition of material by 3 axis movement (X, Y and Z). To identify the correct parameters for metal part we have done numbers of samples by changing values in the MIG machine from that we finalize the three parameters through visualizes on the printed materials after that a wall like structure is built and post processing like cutting the materials from base plate, grinding the uneven surface on printed materials. The printed materials are ready for material testing like bead geometry analysis of various parameter and tensile testing to identify the printed material strength, elongation, stress and strain. © 2021 University of Kuwait.

Additive manufacturing (AM) allows for production localization and improvements in SC resilience. However, the comparative competitiveness of a localized SC from the time and cost perspective is still unclear. In this study, we investigate the competitiveness of localized medical part AM SCs against centralized ones by analyzing the responsiveness and cost of each SC. We utilize a real-world case study in which an AM service provider supplies medical parts to university medical centers in the Netherlands to construct six scenarios. We also develop a thorough empirical cost formulation for both central and local AM of patient-specific medical parts. The results of scenario analysis show that when utilizing the currently available AM technology, localized SC configurations significantly reduce the delivery time from about 54 to 27h, but at a 4.3-fold higher cost. Hence, we illustrate that the cost difference between the localized and centralized scenarios can be reduced when state-of-the-art AM machines are utilized, demand volumes increase, and the distances between the SC network nodes expand. Moreover, our scenario analysis confirms that the cost of the measures taken to prevent dust dispersion associated with powder-bed fusion AM has a major impact on the total cost of localized AM SCs for medical parts. The results of this study contribute to the understanding of the relevant factors in deciding whether central or localized SC configurations can be used in the AM production of medical parts. Furthermore, this study provides managerial insights for decision-makers at governments and hospitals as well as AM service providers and AM equipment manufacturers.  © 2013 IEEE.","Additive manufacturing; cost modeling; localized manufacturing; medical parts","3D printers; Additives; Competition; Cost reduction; Decision making; Hospitals; Supply chains; Centralized supply chains; Cost differences; Cost formulation; Equipment manufacturers; Patient specific; Scenario analysis; Service provider; State of the art; Cost benefit analysis","","","","","Academy of Finland, (323831, 325509); Academy of Finland","This work was supported in part by two Academy of Finland projects, in part by the Direct Operations Project under Grant 323831, and in part by the Direct Digital Manufacturing in Health Care Production and Operations (DiDiMinH) under Grant 325509.","Armani A.M., Hurt D.E., Hwang D., McCarthy M.C., Scholtz A., Low-tech solutions for the COVID-19 supply chain crisis, Nature Rev.

This study investigates the mechanisms behind the evolution of surface roughness (Ra) in overhang regions. The evolution of surface morphology is the result of a combination of border track contour, powder adhesion, warp deformation, and dross formation, which is strongly related to the overhang angle (θ). When 0° ≤ θ ≤ 15°, the overhang angle does not affect Ra significantly since only a small area of the melt pool boundaries contacts the powder bed resulting in slight powder adhesion. When 15° < θ ≤ 50°, powder adhesion is enhanced by the melt pool sinking and the increased contact area between the melt pool boundary and powder bed. When θ > 50°, large waviness of the overhang contour, adhesion of powder clusters, severe warp deformation and dross formation increase Ra sharply. © 2021 The Author(s).

However, by this time, no study has been encountered in the literature regarding investigation of the effects of boriding on metal-ceramic bond strength of Co–Cr alloy fabricated by selective laser melting. Boriding of metallic surfaces may be an alternative to increase the roughness and adhesion strength of the metal surface. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of boriding on the metal-ceramic bond strength of a Co–Cr alloy fabricated by selective laser melting. In this study, metal substructures of 0.1 mm, 0.2 mm and 0.3 mm thickness values were produced from CoCrW powders with the method of selective laser melting, borided at 900 °C for 1 h and coated with porcelain. After the procedures, the effects of the boriding process on metal-porcelain bonding were determined by in vitro fracture tests. The 0.1 mm 900 °C 1 h (521.22 ± 56.37 N), (p < 0.001), 0.2 mm 900 °C 1 h (619.55 ± 20.94 N), (p = 0.051) and 0.3 mm 900 °C 1 h (592.11 ± 260.58 N) specimens showed the highest bond strength, significantly higher than that of the 0.1 mm Untreated (299.88 ± 61.56 N), 0.2 mm Untreated (480.55 ± 11.87 N) and 0.3 mm Untreated (520.00 ± 165.52 N), (p = 0.29) specimens. According to the results, with the help of the boriding process applied on the surfaces of the metal substructure samples, the bonding resistance of the porcelain applied onto the metal substructures increased by approximately 74, 29 and 14% in comparison to the samples that were not borided respectively for the thicknesses of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 mm. Boriding of metallic surfaces increased the bond strength of the metal material with ceramics. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","biomaterial; boriding; Metal-ceramic Bond strength;

In this work, Al7075 composite powders decorated with TiN nanoparticles are produced by an ultrasonic vibration dispersion technique. Results show that the laser reflectivity of the composite powders is notably reduced, leading to improved LPBF processability. Therefore, nearly dense and crack-free TiN/Al7075 composites are successfully fabricated by LPBF. The microstructure of as-built composites is significantly refined after adding TiN nanoparticles, thus inhibiting the crack initiation. The TiN/Al7075 composites exhibit remarkably improved microhardness and compressive properties compared to unreinforced Al7075 alloy.

It utilizes the focus cue present in the stack of images, obtained by a single camera. In SFF when the images are acquired, the inter-frame distance, also known as the sampling step size, is assumed to be constant. However, in practice, due to mechanical constraints, sampling step size cannot remain constant. The inconsistency in the sampling step size causes the problem of jitter, and produces Jitter noise in focus curves. This Jitter noise is not visible in images, because each pixel in an image (of the stack) will be subjected to the same error in focus. Thus, traditional image denoising techniques will not work. This paper formulates a model of the Jitter noise, followed by the design of system and measurement models for Kalman filter. Then, the jittering problem for SFF systems is solved using the proposed filtering technique. Experiments are performed on simulated and real objects. Ten noise levels are considered for simulated, and four for real objects. RMSE and Correlation are used to measure the reconstructed shape. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.  © 2013 IEEE.","Jitter noise; Kalman filter; Noise Modeling; Shape from focus; shape reconstruction","Image denoising; Jitter; De-noising techniques; Filtering technique; Measurement model; Mechanical constraints; Passive technique; Sampling step sizes; Shape from focus; Single cameras; Kalman filters","","","","","","","Ahmad M.B., Choi T.S., Application of three dimensional shape from image focus in LCD/TFT displays manufacturing, IEEE Trans.

The process of melting and re-solidification of several layers of deposited material can result in geometric deviations, and the impact is particularly significant for sub-millimetre structures oriented at a wide range of overhang angles with respect to the building platform. This paper assesses and benchmarks the capabilities of a neural network-based geometric compensation approach for truss lattice structures with circular cross-sections. The neural network method is capable to generate free-form cross-sections with enhanced geometric freedom for compensation compared to more established analytical compensation approaches limited to predefined geometric shapes. For neural network training, lattice dome structures composed of trusses with different overhang angles were designed and printed by selective laser melting and measured via X-ray computed tomography, resulting in point cloud data sets containing more than 20,000 data points for each overhang angle. For experimental validation, neural network-compensated dome structures were benchmarked against dome structures with elliptical parameter compensation. Results show that the neural network compensated lattice trusses achieve higher printing dimensional accuracy compared to the uncompensated structures and those compensated based on elliptical parameter estimates. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial neural network; Geometricy compensation; Selective laser melting","Computerized tomography; Domes; Geometry; Melting; Powder metals; Selective laser melting; Trusses; Circular cross-sections; Dimensional accuracy; Experimental validations; Geometric deviations; Neural network method; Neural network training; Parameter compensation; X-ray computed tomography; Neural networks","","","","","Additive Manufacturing Centre; Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR; Science and Engineering Research Council, SERC, (142 68 00088); Science and Engineering Research Council, SERC","Funding text 1: This work is supported by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and the Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) of Singapore through the Additive Manufacturing Centre (AMC) Initiative – SIMTech-led R&D projects (SERC Grant no. 142 68 00088 ).; Funding text 2: This work is supported by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and the Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) of Singapore through the Additive Manufacturing Centre (AMC) Initiative ?

The influence of structural parameters, such as subtending angle, overlap between layers and relative density on the mechanical response of such structures was studied. The results obtained showed high influence of the overlap between layers. The FEM model predicted a range in which the stiffness of such structures can lie. This was compared with experimental results, showing good agreement. The samples were further characterized microstructurally, revealing more defects for higher values of lattice porosity, affecting the structural properties. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Additive manufacturing; curved structures; finite element method; fused deposition modeling; lattice structures","3D printers; Deposition; Fabrication; Finite element method; Layered manufacturing; Arc structures; Curved structure; Elastic response; FEM modeling; Lattice structures; Mechanical response; Relative density; Structural parameter; Fused Deposition Modeling","","","","","Miss Delia Silva","We acknowledge the support of the School of Engineering Sciences at Tecnológico de Monterrey.

Progressive buckling of cell walls during compression delivers good specific strength and energy absorption. In a cellular solid, the arrangement of the cell wall material with respect to the direction of loading has a key influence on its mechanical response. This is especially true for cellular materials loaded in dynamic compression, where dynamic buckling and inertial stabilisation effects can also be sensitive to the alignment of cell walls with the loading direction. Origami-based geometries provide one route to designing cellular materials to achieve controllable collapse modes and, in some cases, auxeticity. The stacked Miura-ori geometry has been proposed recently as a strategy for constructing a volume of periodic cellular solid from an origami-inspired unit cell. However, these have been previously difficult to manufacture. Using selective laser melting, an additive manufacturing process, stainless steel stacked origami materials were produced in a periodic cellular arrangement for the first impact tests on such a cellular material. The origami specimens were tested with a gas gun and direct impact Hopkinson bar apparatus, at impact speeds of 50 m/s and 100 m/s. The auxetic behaviour of the origami fold was observed to diminish at the higher impact speeds, due to the localisation of deformation to individual fold layers. Different fold configurations were studied through simulations, with clear trends observed between fold angle and specific energy absorption and strength. Lastly, the influence of material strain rate sensitivity was investigated numerically. © 2020","Additive manufacturing; Auxetic materials; Blast; Cellular materials; Impact; Origami; Selective laser melting","Buckling; Cells; Cellular manufacturing; Cytology; Energy absorption; Sandwich structures; Selective laser melting; Strain rate; Additive manufacturing process; Cellular arrangement; Dynamic compression; Impact energy absorption; Progressive buckling; Specific energy absorption; Strain rate sensitivity; Structural protection; Laser materials processing","","","","","British Crown Owned Copyright 2020; Fraunhofer IWU Institute in Chemnitz/Dresden; Atomic Weapons Establishment, AWE","Funding text 1: We are grateful to AWE for financial support, and to Richard Kordaß of the Fraunhofer IWU Institute in Chemnitz/Dresden (Germany) for manufacturing the specimens and for the useful discussions.

The biodegradable stent can effectively reduce the damage to patients and improve the therapeutic performance of stents. In this work, a series of shape memory polylactic acid (Fe3O4) composite tracheal stents were manufactured by 4D printing. The composite tracheal stents with different structures were designed. Moreover, with the addition of magnetic particles Fe3O4, the shape memory PLA/Fe3O4 composite tracheal stent has a magnetic driving effect. Under the magnetic field, the shape recovery process is completed within 40 s, and the shape recovery rate is more than 99%. Moreover, the 4D printed tracheal stent was also triggered by the irradiation of infrared lamp to realize the remote controlling recovery. The research on the structure design and driving method of 4D printing tracheal stent expands the application scope of shape memory polymer composites in biomedical field, provides a new way for personalized implantable medical devices and minimally invasive surgery.

However, during CMT arc additive manufacturing, the surrounding air environment promotes the lateral flow of liquid aluminium and the instability of the molten pool, reduces the surface quality and material utilisation of deposition walls, and causes internal hydrogen pores and coarse columnar grains, which negatively affect the structure and mechanical properties of the deposition walls. This study developed a CMT arc additive die manufacturing process to control the substrate material and deposition path to improve the physical properties of the deposition wall. The experimental results indicated that the copper plates can affect molten pool flow and material formation in the additive process, minimise hydrogen pores, and refine columnar grains. The porosity dropped from 2.03% to 0.93%, and the average grain size decreased from 16.2 ± 1.4 to 13.6 ± 1.3 μm, thereby enhancing the structure and mechanical properties of the deposition wall to attain standard additive manufacturing products. © 2021 An Zhang et al.","","Additives;

Accordingly, this paper suggests innovative circular tubes with in-plane thickness gradient along their perimeter and assesses their crashworthiness behaviour under lateral loading. Three different designs of circular tubes with thickness gradient were considered in which the locations of maximum and minimum thicknesses are varied. Selective laser melting method of additive manufacturing was used to manufacture the different tubes. Two different bulk powders including titanium (Ti6Al4V) and aluminium (AlSi10Mg) were used in the manufacturing process. Quasi-static crush experiments were conducted on the laser melted tubes to investigate their crushing and energy absorption behaviour. The energy absorption characteristics of the different FGT tubes were calculated and compared against a uniform thickness design. The results revealed that the best crashworthiness metrics were offered by FGT titanium tube in which the maximum thickness regions were along the horizontal and vertical directions while the minimum thickness regions were at an angle of 45° with respect to the loading direction. The aforementioned tube was found to absorb 79% greater energy per unit mass than its uniform thickness counterpart. Finally, with the aid of numerical simulations and surrogate modelling techniques, multi-objective optimisation and parametric analysis were conducted on the best FGT tube. The influences of the geometrical parameters on the crashworthiness responses of the best FGT structure were explored and the optimal thickness gradient parameters were determined. The results reported in this paper provide valuable guidance on the design of FGT energy absorption tubes for lateral deformation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Crashworthiness; Energy absorption;

Therefore, this process has several advantages that can solve many manufacturing problems by the control of remodelling the output sample by setting the printing parameters such as printing temperature, speed, infill percentage and layer height. Finding the suitable setting parameters for the output sample can be a great challenge for the user, which can affect the mechanical characteristics of the produced printed sample. This paper examines the impacts of the printing angles and orientation on the mechanical characteristics of the acid of polylactic (PLA) and the particles of carbon in the output sample. To calculate this influence, a 3D printed sample for tensile strength and charpy was made at 0o, - 45o, /+45º, 60° and 90º. The orientation was different but, the other of the factors hold constant such as infill density and layer height. Four different results were analysed for the impact resistance of these tests. The maximum impact resistance, 23.3 kJ, was obtained with 100% infill density and 0.1 mm layer height at 45ºorientation. Results showed that printing angles (0°,-45/+45º, 60°) with 100% infill density is recommended. Furthermore, by making the comparison between the analysis finding with the finding of other studies, the printer parameters and materials were found to impact the mechanical characteristics of PLA sections significantly. © 2021 Zibeline International Publishing Sdn.

This, one might expect, would enhance the precision and safety of biomedicine. However, it has been recognized that software can bring about new risks to the field of medicine and medical devices, requiring at least some degree of caution from the different players responsible for technology governance and risk management. This phenomenon is focused on in this paper, from the viewpoint of 3D bioprinting. Bioprinting is the production of bioactive structures in a layer-by-layer deposition of cells, with the use of devices called bioprinters. The latter can only function by receiving instructions from software. This paper focuses on some software-supported techniques that are key for bioprinting. It shows that a growing range of software packages has been used in bioprinting, a trend that is greatly fostered by open source software. In this evolution, the clinical potentialities of bioprinting come closer to their realization. At the same time, however, uncertainties emerge, related to issues such as data protection, use of biological samples, and others. The growing use of open source software complexifies the scenario, because it leads to a multiplication of actors directly or indirectly involved in the technology’s development, making it difficult to trace liabilities and damages. As no national regulation has been produced to tackle such uncertainties, they have been (provisionally and precariously) addressed in the licenses of software packages. In the years to come, as clinical products eventually spring from bioprinting research, more robust governance schemes will have to emerge in which risks and liabilities are dealt with more carefully by different players. Moreover, regulations will have to address the practice of combining different software packages in the same bioprinting process, as well as the growing globalization of bioprinting research and commercial exploration. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bioprinting; liabilities; risks; software; software licenses; technology governance","3D printers; Biology; Clinical research; Deposition; Open systems; Privacy by design; Risk management; Risks; Software packages; Biological samples; Bioprinting; Layer by layer deposition; Medical Devices; Open source software","","","","","Leverhulme Trust, (68387)","This work is supported by the Leverhulme Trust under the grant number 68387.","Abudayyeh I., Gordon B., Ansari M.M., Jutzy K., Stoletniy L., Hilliard A., A Practical Guide to Cardiovascular 3D Printing in Clinical Practice: Overview and Examples, Journal of Interventional Cardiology, 31, 3, pp. 375-383, (2018); Ahadian S., Khademhosseini A., A Perspective on 3D Bioprinting in Tissue Regeneration, Bio-Design and Manufacturing, 1, 3, pp. 157-160, (2018); Antonelli C., Quere M., The Governance of Interactive Learning within Innovation Systems, Urban Studies, 39, 5-6, pp. 1051-1063, (2002); Atal V., Shankar K., Developers' Incentives and Open-Source Software Licensing: GPL vs BSD, The B.E.

In this letter, two newly discovered dimensionless numbers are presented that correlate process parameters to a part's density allowing for an initial estimation of suitable process parameters without the need for extensive modeling or experimentation. The prediction is achieved by utilizing the Buckingham-Π theorem and the implementation of Pawlowski's matrix transformation method. The universality of the new dimensionless numbers is verified by applying them to selective laser melting data for eight different metals and alloy systems, obtained both experimentally and gathered from the literature. The dimensionless numbers allow for identification of process parameters that will result in a maximum density regime in the as-built part. Finally, a universal scaling law is introduced that can aid in quantitative prediction of process parameters that result in the highest as-built density. © 2020 Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME)","Additive manufacturing; Density; Dimensionless number; Process parameters; Selective laser melting; Universal scaling law","Forecasting; Linear transformations; Melting; Powder metals; Selective laser melting; Buckingham-pi theorem; Dimensionless number; Initial estimation; Matrix transformation; Process parameters; Processing parameters; Quantitative prediction; Universal scaling; Parameter estimation","","","","","Draper Technology Innovation Fund; Grainger Institute for Engineering; UW2020 WARF","The authors would like to acknowledge the support from Discovery to Product through the grant Draper Technology Innovation Fund.

Three-dimensional printing has come into wide use in different industries including fashion industry. Fashion and textile designers adopt the 3D printing technology as their creative design tool, for example, when creating 3D printed garments, fabrics or fashion accessories. It can be predicted that 3D printing technology will be rapidly applied and it will play an important role in the fashion industry in the future. This research study aimed to develop a theoretical design process model specifically for the creation of a 3D printed fashion prototype with multi-coloured surface texture. By adopting the practice-based research methodology and the developed design process model with reference to the theories of 3D printing technologies, practical concept, physical prototyping techniques and corresponding evaluation of various design elements, an innovative 3D printed fashion prototype was finally produced. © The Textile Institute and Informa UK Ltd 2020.","3D printed fashion; multi-coloured texture; theoretical design process model","","","","","","","","Ahearn L., 3D game textures: Create professional game art using photoshop, (2014); Arnheim R., Art and visual perception: A psychology of the creative eye, (2004); Campbell T., Williams C., Ivanova O., Garrett B., Could 3D printing change the world?

This paper aims to study a subset of these solutions for their utilization of design for AM (DfAM) techniques and investigate the effects of DfAM utilization on the creativity and manufacturing efficiency of these solutions. Design/methodology/approach: This study compiled 26 COVID-19-related solutions designed for AM spanning three categories: (1) face shields (N = 6), (2) face masks (N = 12) and (3) hands-free door openers (N = 8). These solutions were assessed for (1) DfAM utilization, (2) manufacturing efficiency and (3) creativity. The relationships between these assessments were then computed using generalized linear models to investigate the influence of DfAM utilization on manufacturing efficiency and creativity. Findings: It is observed that (1) unique and original designs scored lower in their AM suitability, (2) solutions with higher complexity scored higher on usefulness and overall creativity and (3) solutions with higher complexity had higher build cost, build time and material usage. These findings highlight the need to account for both opportunistic and restrictive DfAM when evaluating solutions designed for AM. Balancing the two DfAM perspectives can support the development of solutions that are creative and consume fewer build resources. Originality/value: DfAM evaluation tools primarily focus on AM limitations to help designers avoid build failures. This paper proposes the need to assess designs for both, their opportunistic and restrictive DfAM utilization to appropriately assess the manufacturing efficiency of designs and to realize the creative potential of adopting AM. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Creativity; Design; Design for additive manufacturing; Innovation; Manufacturing efficiency; Product design","Additives; Balancing; Design for manufacturability; Efficiency; Creative potentials; Design/methodology/approach; Evaluation tool; Generalized linear model; Innovative engineering; Manufacturing efficiency; Rapid prototyping and manufacturing; Three categories; 3D printers","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CMMI-1712234); National Science Foundation, NSF","Funding.

The skyshine photons from a Linac bunker can influence the radiation dose received by personnel and the public in radiation therapy centers. Materials and Methods: In the current study skyshine dose from the conventional flattened beam and the flattening-free beam were compared. The MCNPX Monte Carlo code was used to model an18 MeV photon beam of Varian linac. The skyshine radiation was calculated for FF and FFF linac photon beams at the control room, parking, sidewalk, and corridor around the linac room. Results: For the conventional beam, the skyshine dose rates of 0.53, 0.42, 0.45, and 0.50 mSv/h were estimated for the control room, corridor, sidewalk, and parking, respectively. While for the FFF beam, dose rates of 0.21, 0.20, 0.20, and 0.23 mSv/h were estimated for the same positions, respectively. The results indicated that the empirical method of NCRP 151 can not distinguish between FF and FFF beams in skyshine dose calculations.

The Vf is needed to establish mechanical properties of composites using the rule of mixtures or other more advanced prediction models for the mechanical properties. The proposed method is tested with images acquired for carbon, Kevlar, and fiberglass fiber bundles used in the fiber deposition modeling (FDM) in the additive manufacturing process. The fiber bundles are provided by Markforged ® and are used in the Markforged Two ® printer. Then, different gray threshold and segregation algorithms are convolved with the digitized images to to isolate matrix from fibers such that a separate fiber and matrix area counting can be done and an appropriate Vf can be established. Results obtained with image analysis are close to values reported using technical standards, hence validating the proposed method. © 2021 Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos.

The reduction in residual stresses is crucial to avoid the deformation of the component during its removal from the building platform. Among the different heat treatments, 800 °C kept almost unaltered the original microstructure, reducing the residual stresses. Heat treatments at 900, 980, and 1065 °C gradually triggered the melt pool and dendritic structures dissolution, drastically reducing the residual stresses. Heat treatments at 900 and 980 °C involved the formation of δ phases, whereas 1065 °C generated carbides. These heat treatments were also performed on components with narrow internal channels revealing that heat treatments up to 900 °C did not trigger sintering mechanisms allowing to remove the powder from the inner channels. © 2020, The Author(s).","additive manufacturing; hardness; laser powder bed fusion; microstructure; phase state; residual stress; superalloys","Carbides; Microstructure; Sintering; Building platforms; Dendritic structures; Fusion process; Inconel-718; Internal channel; Laser powders; Sintering mechanism; Stress evolution; Residual stresses","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (723795); Politecnico di Torino, POLITO; Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR, (TESHUN-83486178370409)","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the European Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; grant agreement No.723795/4D Hybrid–Novel ALL-IN-ONE machines, robots, and systems for affordable, worldwide and lifetime distributed 3D hybrid manufacturing and repair operations.

A multi-sensing system for each specific manufacturing process can efficiently collect the in situ process variables from different sensor modalities to reflect the process variations in real-time. However, in practice, we usually do not have enough budget to equip too many sensors in each manufacturing process due to the cost consideration. Moreover, it is also important to better interpret the relationship between the sensing modalities and the quality variables based on the model. Therefore, it is necessary to model the quality-process relationship by selecting the most relevant sensor modalities with the specific quality measurement from the multi-modal sensing system in smart manufacturing. In this research, we adopted the concept of best subset variable selection and proposed a new model called Multi-mOdal beSt Subset modeling (MOSS). The proposed MOSS can effectively select the important sensor modalities and improve the modeling accuracy in quality-process modeling via functional norms that characterize the overall effects of individual modalities. The significance of sensor modalities can be used to determine the sensor placement strategy in smart manufacturing. Moreover, the selected modalities can better interpret the quality-process model by identifying the most correlated root cause of quality variations. The merits of the proposed model are illustrated by both simulations and a real case study in an additive manufacturing (i.e., fused deposition modeling) process. © 2021 by the authors.

So far, such compositions were mainly based on solutions of pre-ceramic polymers which limit their applications to silicon-containing materials. However, the application of particle-free inks for the fabrication of other ceramic materials, in particular dense polycrystalline ones, is very little explored. We present a new and general fabrication approach based on all-solution compositions, by combining sol–gel chemistry and photopolymerization, for obtaining dense 3D ceramic structures by DLP printing. The process is demonstrated here for the fabrication of barium titanate (BaTiO3). By using chelating solvent and monomer, a stable UV-curable solution is obtained. An aging period of 8–14 days was crucial for obtaining dense ceramic objects without any secondary phases. The heat treatment was found to affect the microstructure, density and hardness of the resulting ceramics. The presented process enables obtaining objects free of carbon materials, having a density as high as 98% of the theoretical value, and a hardness of 4.3 GPa. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","3D printing; additive manufacturing; barium titanate; ceramics; Digital Light Processing (DLP); photopolymerization; sol–gel","3D printers; Barium titanate; Chlorine containing polymers; Curing; Hardness; Heat treatment; Photopolymerization; Sols; Carbon material; Ceramic compositions; Ceramic polymers; Ceramic structure; Digital light processing; Polycrystalline; Secondary phasis; Theoretical values; Structure (composition)","","","","","National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF; Hebrew University of Jerusalem, HUJI; Ministry of Science and Technology, Israel; Ministry of Defense, MOD","This research is partially supported by grants from the Israel Ministry of Science and Technology, the Israel Ministry of Defense, and the National Research Foundation, Prime Minister’s Office, Singapore under its Campus of Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE) program.

Past studies have largely focused on how the process parameters such as laser power and scan speed affect melt pool characteristics. In this study, the melt pool morphology variation as a function of preheating temperature in the conduction, transition, and keyhole regimes and the underlying mechanisms in each regime are investigated through ex-situ sample characterization and computation thermal fluid dynamics (CtFD) simulation. Single tracks with different combinations of laser power and scan speed are deposited on an Inconel 718 bare plate preheated to a temperature range of 100–500 °C in the experiment. Significant changes are observed in melt pool morphology as a function of preheating temperature from optical measurements of melt track cross sections. The depth of melt pool in the three regimes increases monotonically with preheating temperature, e.g., at 500 °C, the experimental melt pool depth is increased by 49% in conduction regime, 34% in transition regime and 33% in keyhole regime, respectively, while the variation of melt pool width in each regime does not all follow an increasing trend but depends on the melt pool regimes. Melt pool width variation in the conduction and transition regimes is found to depend on the enhanced heat conduction directly related to temperature dependent thermal properties. Through validated CtFD simulations, it is found that in the keyhole regime the evaporation mass, recoil pressure, and laser drilling effect is enhanced with higher preheating temperature, which gives rise to a deeper melt pool. The simulations also reveal that preheating temperature significantly elongates the melt track length due to the increased flow rate and strong recoil pressure that accelerates the backward flow. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Laser powder bed fusion; Melt pool variation; Preheating temperature; Recoil pressure; Vapor depression","3D printers; Heat conduction; Lakes; Optical data processing; Preheating; Conduction regime; Mechanical performance; Optical measurement; Preheating temperature; Process parameters; Temperature range; Temperature-dependent thermal property; Transition regimes; Morphology","","","","","United States Government; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (18H05455); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-FE0031774); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; NASA Early Stage Innovations, (NNX17AD11G)","The financial support from NASA Early Stage Innovations under Award number NNX17AD11G and Department of Energy under Award number DE-FE0031774 is gratefully acknowledged.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of process parameters on the overhanging surface roughness of AlSi10Mg specimens without a support structure under different build angles, 30°, 45° and 60°, respectively. A design of experiment (DoE) approach was adopted to clarify the correlations between the overhanging surface roughness and the causative the process parameters such as contour laser power, contour scanning speed, infill laser power, infill scanning speed and infill scanning angle. The results showed that the influence of each process parameter on the overhanging surface roughness varies with the change in build angle. Above all, the dominant factor was the contour scanning speed. The results of the comparison show that the contour process parameters are much more influential than the infill process parameters. In addition, the process parameters affected the overhanging surface roughness were on the decrease as the build angle increases. When the build angle was 30°, it was necessary to comprehensively consider the influence of infill scanning angle, contour scanning speed and infill scanning speed to obtain a smooth overhanging surface with a low roughness. However, as the build angle increased to 60°, only the contour scanning speed had a highly significant impact. The results also revealed that apart from the contour scanning speed, the interaction between contour scanning speed and contour laser power should be given priority when the build angle is 30° or less.

Hollow microneedles (HMNs) are highly detailed objects due to their internal microchannels and thus, their fabrication with Additive Manufacturing (AM) is a challenging task. Vat polymerization techniques provide a sufficient accuracy for such microstructures. Differentiated from other approaches where stereolithography and 2-photon polymerization were adopted, this paper presents the 3D-printing of HMNs purposed for insulin delivery, using the more economic Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) method. First, different geometries (hexagon, square pyramid, beveled) were 3D printed with constant height and varying curing time, printing angle and layer resolution. Quality features in each case were captured with optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The most promising geometry was found to be the beveled one due to the more refined tip area and the feasibility of non-clogged microchannel formation. Among printing parameters, printing angle proved to be the most influential, as it affects resin flow phenomenon during printing process. Lastly, optimized HMN geometry was the beveled configuration, where the average height was measured 900μm, 3D printing angle was set at-45°, the curing time was 10s per layer and the optimal layer height was 30μm. © 2021, ModTech Publishing House.

Nevertheless, small-scale structures often suffer from a wide range of morphological defects, which impact the macro-scale mechanical properties. In this work, prominent morphological factors including geometric irregularities (surface notches and cross-section deviation), node geometry and printing direction are assessed for four batches of L-PBF Ti-6Al-4 V cubic lattice specimens, and their fatigue behavior compared. The results show that smoothing the strut fillets at their node remarkably improves the S-N curves and that the printing direction impacts both the fatigue strength and the failure behavior. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Additive Manufacturing;

At present, induction heating is widely used in various industrial applications such as melting, preheating, heat treatment, welding, and brazing. The potential of this source has not been explored in the additive manufacturing domain. However, the use of induction heating in additive manufacturing could lead to low-cost part fabrication as compared to other energy sources such as laser or electron beam. Therefore, this study explores the feasibility of this energy source in additive manufacturing for fabricating parts of metallic materials. An experimental system has been developed by modifying an existing delta three-dimensional printer. An induction heater coil has been incorporated to extruder head for semi-solid processing of the metal alloy. In order to test the viability of the developed system, aluminium material in the filament form has been processed. Obtained results have shown that the induction heating–based energy source is capable of processing metallic materials having a melting point up to 1000° C. The continuous extrusion of the material has been achieved by controlling the extruder temperature using a proportional integral derivative–based controller and k-type thermocouple. The study also discusses various issues and challenges that occurred during the melting of metal with induction heating. The outcomes of this study may be a breakthrough in the area of metal-based additive manufacturing. © IMechE 2020.","Additive manufacturing; aluminium; induction heating; material extrusion; metal deposition","3D printers; Additives; Extruders; Metals; Proportional control systems; Thermocouples; Two term control systems; Alternate energy sources; Continuous extrusion; Experimental system; Induction heating system; Issues and challenges; K-type thermocouples; Proportional integral derivatives; Semi-solid processing; Induction heating","","","","","AMT; TDT; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, डीएसटी","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author would like to thank DST/TDT/AMT, India, for providing financial support.

Depending on discovering new materials and techniques, additive manufacturing technologies also develop and become more economical and sustainable technology. The widespread use of this technology in industrial areas has accelerated development and contributed to increased product quality. However, to ensure the development and continuity of this technology, it is necessary to reduce the production costs, increase the quality and accelerate the production processes. These processes also trigger competition and accelerate the development of technology. The areas that additive manufacturing technologies are mostly applied can be grouped as aerospace, biomedical, smart technologies, and other industrial applications. The fact that these areas are popular research areas also accelerates the development of additive manufacturing technologies. In this review, additive manufacturing technologies from past to present, advantages and disadvantages of these technologies, aspects that need to be developed, and industrial applications are examined and explained. When the studies on additive manufacturing technologies and industrial applications are examined, it is seen that this technology has a wide usage area. With the use of additive manufacturing technologies, previously encountered in prototypes and special applications, in automotive, biomedical, and smart technologies, it is seen that they have begun to take place more in people's daily lives. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office","Additive manufacturing;

Austenitic stainless steels are analysed showing the possibility to successfully process them, targeting different applications. In particular, it is shown that stainless steels can be successfully processed and their mechanical behaviour allows them to be put in service. Porosities inside manufactured components are extremely low and comparable to conventionally processed materials. Mechanical performances are even higher than standard requirements. Micro surface roughness typical of the as-built material can act as crack initiator, reducing the strength in both quasi-static and dynamic conditions. © 2020.

In recent years, the application of arc welding processes has been studied as additive manufacturing techniques for metals. When compared to laser welding processes, they have low equipment cost, high deposition rate, however a low surface quality. This work proposes to study the machinability of additive manufacturing parts using automated GMAW. The deposition was carried out using a robotic arm, using ER70S-6' wire with a substrate of nodular cast iron. Two deposition strategies were carried out, one alternating the passes directions and the other one depositing in the same direction. The machining process used was milling in a three axis machining center. The deposition strategy had an influence on the parts surface finish after machining, as well as on the tool life. © 2021, Universidade do Porto - Faculdade de Engenharia.

This paper presents a new digital design and manufacturing paradigm to solve the scalability and efficiency challenges by using the concept of STL-free workflow. It seamlessly integrates implicit solid modelling for design and direct slicing for manufacturing without any intermediate steps related to STL meshes. The presented paradigm has been validated by two case studies involving complex geometries filled with multiscale triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS), which are fabricated by PBF with laser beam size 25 µm. © 2021 CIRP","Additive manufacturing; Direct slicing; Implicit modelling; Powder bed fusion; Triply periodic minimal surfaces","Computational geometry; Laser beams; Complex geometries; Digital design and manufacturing; Direct slicing; High-precision; Implicit solids; Laser beam size; Manufacturing paradigm; Triply periodic minimal surfaces; Manufacture","","","","","","","Schmidt M., Merklein M., Bourell D., Dimitrov D., Hausotte T., Wegener K., Overmeyer L., Vollertsen F., Levy G N., Laser based additive manufacturing in industry and academia, CIRP Ann, 66, 2, pp. 561-583, (2017); Bourell D., Kruth J P., Leu M., Levy G., Rosen D., Beese A M., Clare A., Materials for additive manufacturing, CIRP Ann, 66, 2, pp. 659-681, (2017); Thompson M.K., Moroni G., Vaneker T., Fadel G., Campbell R.I., Gibson I., Bernard A., Schulz J., Graf P., Ahuja B., Martina F., Design for additive manufacturing: trends, opportunities, considerations, and constraints, CIRP Ann, 65, 2, pp. 737-760, (2016); Vaneker T., Bernard A., Moroni G., Gibson I., Zhang Y., Design for additive manufacturing: framework and methodology, CIRP Ann, 69, 2, pp. 578-599, (2020); Yoo D J., Advanced projection image generation algorithm for fabrication of a tissue scaffold using volumetric distance field, Int J Precis Eng Manuf, 15, 10, pp. 2117-2126, (2014); Wu Y., Gupta A., Kurzeja K., Rossignac J., Chocc: convex hull of cospherical circles and applications to lattices, Comput-Aided Des, 129, (2020); Chougrani L., Pernot J., P, V eron P., Abed S., Lattice structure lightweight triangulation for additive manufacturing, Comput-Aided Des, 90, pp. 95-104, (2017); Huang P., Wang C.C.L., Chen Y., Intersection-free and topologically faithful slicing of implicit solid, J Comput Inf Sci Eng, 13, 2, (2013); Feng J., Fu J., Lin Z., Shang C., Niu X., Layered infill area generation from triply periodic minimal surfaces for additive manufacturing, Comput-Aided Des, 107, pp. 50-63, (2019); Tang Y., Xiong Y., Boddeti G.N., Rosen D W., Generation of lattice structures with convolution surface, CAD conference, Singapore, pp. 69-74, (2019); Zhang Z., Joshi S., Slice data representation and format for multi-material objects for additive manufacturing processes, Rapid Prototyp J, 23, 1, pp. 149-161, (2017)","C.C.L.

A microfluidic chip that can simulate the structure and function of bone will provide a platform for bone-related biomedical research. Hydroxyapatite (HA), a bioactive ceramic material, has a similar structure and composition to bone mineralization products. In this study, we used HA as a microfluidic chip component to provide a highly bionic bone environment. HA substrates with different microchannel structures were printed by using ceramic stereolithography (SLA) technology, and the minimum trench width was 50 μm. The HA substrate with microchannels was sealed by a thin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer to make a HA-PDMS microfluidic chip. Cell culture experiments demonstrated that compared with PDMS, HA was more conducive to the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of the human foetal osteoblast cell line (hFOB). In addition, the concentration gradient of the model drug doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) was successfully generated on a Christmas tree structure HA-PDMS chip, and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of DOX was determined. The findings of this study indicate that the HA-PDMS microfluidic chip has great potential in the field of high-throughput bone-related drug screening and bone-related research. © 2020 [The Author/The Authors]","Biomimetic; Bone-on-a-chip; Ceramic microfluidic chip; Drug screening; Hydroxyapatite (HA)","5 chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; alkaline phosphatase; biomaterial; chelating agent; collagen type 1; dimethyl sulfoxide; dimeticone; doxorubicin; edetic acid; elastomer; fluorescein isothiocyanate; fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer I; hydroxyapatite; osteopontin; oxytocin; phosphate buffered saline; rhodamine; transcription factor RUNX2; trypsin; unclassified drug; Article; biocompatibility; bone development; cancer resistance; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; cell suspension; cell viability; confocal microscopy; controlled study; differential scanning calorimetry; drug screening; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; fluorescence microscopy; gene expression; human; human cell; hydrogen bond; IC50; immunofluorescence; infrared spectroscopy; nonhuman; osteoblast; osteoblast cell line; osteoporosis; osteosarcoma; real time polymerase chain reaction; simulation; stereolithography; thermal analysis; thermogravimetry; tissue regeneration; ultraviolet spectrophotometry","","alkaline phosphatase, 9001-78-9; dimethyl sulfoxide, 67-68-5; dimeticone, 32028-95-8, 68248-27-1, 9004-73-3, 9006-65-9; doxorubicin, 23214-92-8, 25316-40-9; edetic acid, 150-43-6, 60-00-4; fluorescein isothiocyanate, 25168-13-2, 27072-45-3, 3326-32-7; hydroxyapatite, 1306-06-5, 51198-94-8; osteopontin, 106441-73-0; oxytocin, 50-56-6, 54577-94-5; trypsin, 9002-07-7","QuantStudio 6 Flex, Life Technologies; SP8, Leica, Germany; UV 2600, Shimadzu, Japan; Vector 33 MIR, Bruker, Germany; merlin, Zeiss, Germany","Bruker, Germany; Leica, Germany; Life Technologies; Shimadzu, Japan; Zeiss, Germany","Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholars, (2016A030306018); Outstanding Scholar Program of Guangzhou Regenerative Medicine and Health Guangdong Laboratory, (2018GZR110102001); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (21874116, 31770107); Guangzhou Science and Technology Program key projects, (201804020060, 202007020002); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, (GJHZ20180411143347603, JCYJ20170815153105076); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, (2017B090911008, 2019B010941002)","The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the Shenzhen Science and Technology Program ( JCYJ20170815153105076 , GJHZ20180411143347603 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 31770107 and 21874116 ), Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province ( 2019B010941002 , 2017B090911008 ), Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholars ( 2016A030306018 ), Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou ( 201804020060 , 202007020002 ) and Outstanding Scholar Program of Guangzhou Regenerative Medicine and Health Guangdong Laboratory ( 2018GZR110102001 ).
