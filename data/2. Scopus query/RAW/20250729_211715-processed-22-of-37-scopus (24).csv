However, the poor tensile ductility of most as-deposited titanium alloys, particularly near-α alloys, hinders their wide usage for critical load-bearing structures. Here we report that a high density of microscale shear bands (MSBs) can be activated in an LDED-produced Ti-6Al-2Zr-1Mo-1V alloy with dispersed microscale α colonies to enhance its tensile ductility. Using high-speed nanoindentation and in situ scanning electron microscopy tensile tests, we correlate the local micromechanical properties and global mechanical behavior of such a LDED-produced titanium alloy: (i) The soft α colonies with a hardness of ∼3.3 GPa produce slip bands (SLBs) with basal and prismatic <a>-slips; (ii) The surrounding hard α colonies or individual laths with a hardness of ∼4.4 GPa are plastically deformed by activating MSBs, which are assisted by pyramidal <a>- and <c + a>-slips. Our results suggest that the nucleation of MSBs relies on the degree of local shear stress acting on the hard domains. The local shear stress is determined by the domain size, spatial orientation, and mechanical contrast with vicinal soft domains. The propagation of MSBs can be arrested by the boundaries between hard and soft domains, suppressing the evolution of MSBs into macroscale catastrophic shear bands and, therefore, enhancing tensile ductility. Our study demonstrates that activating the MSBs provides a new opportunity to effectively enhance the ductility of LDED-produced titanium alloys and expedite the adoption of this additive manufacturing technology for critical structural applications.  © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.","Directed energy deposition; Ductility; Microstructure; Shear bands; Titanium","3D printers; Additives; Aerospace applications; Aluminum alloys; Chemical activation; Deposition; Hardness; Molybdenum alloys; Scanning electron microscopy; Shear bands; Tensile testing; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Zircaloy; Directed energy; Directed energy deposition; Energy depositions; Laser-based; Near net shape; Near-α titanium alloys; Shear-banding; Tensile ductility; Titania; Titanium (alloys); Ductility","","","","","CFI-John R.

However, excessive workpiece heat input may limit its high productivity application. Hence, a bypass-coupled double-pulsed WAAM (BCDP-WAAM) method is developed to control the workpiece heat input without deteriorating productivity. High-speed camera images demonstrated that the arc and droplet trajectory were deflected towards the molten pool side in BCDP-WAAM. The observed strong-to-weak change in the arc necessitated a periodic insertion of the bypass-cathode wire into the molten pool for heat absorption. Spray and bridging transfers occurred in the anode and bypass-cathode wires, respectively. Current–voltage waveforms indicated that a dynamic current distribution between the workpiece and bypass-cathode wire was achieved in BCDP-WAAM, decreasing the workpiece current. Consequently, the workpiece heat input was decreased by 38.2 %. Owing to the twin-melted wires, the height and effective area were increased by 134.1 % and 149.0 % in BCDP-WAAM, respectively. The obtained electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) results indicated that the average grain size was reduced to 21 µm in BCDP-WAAM compared to a grain size of 36 µm in double-pulsed WAAM. This is attributed to the reduction in the workpiece heat input and the change in solidification induced by the bypass-cathode wire. The BCDP-WAAM enhanced the mechanical strength of the part. Furthermore, the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and yield strength (YS) of the optimized part increased to 256 and 124 MPa in BCDP-WAAM, representing increments of 7.1 % and 14.8 %, respectively. The average micro-hardness was enhanced to 88.2 HV, representing an increase of 16.1 %. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Bypass coupled; Directed energy deposition (DED); Double pulsed; Wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM)","Additives; Cathodes; Deposition; Grain size and shape; High speed cameras; Magnesium alloys; Productivity; Tensile strength; Wire; AlMg alloy; Bypass coupled; Directed energy; Directed energy deposition; Double pulsed; Energy depositions; Heat input; Molten pool; Wire and arc additive manufacturing; Workpiece; 3D printers","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51774316, 52075548); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2019YFE0105100); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","The authors thanks for supports of the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2019YFE0105100 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52075548 ), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51774316 ).","Derekar K., A review of wire arc additive manufacturing and advances in wire arc additive manufacturing of aluminium, Mater.

The surface morphology, surface quality, and microstructure of as-fabricated samples were studied. The effects of scanning speed, hatching space, and laser power on surface quality were analyzed, and the optimal LED range for surface quality was determined. The results show that pores and spherical particles appear on the sample’s surface when low LED is applied, while there are lamellar structures on the sides of the samples. Cracks appear on the sample’s surface, and the splash phenomenon increases when a high LED is taken. At the same time, a large amount of unmelted powder adhered to the side of the sample. The surface quality is the best when the LED is 150–170 J/mm3. The preferred hatch space is currently 0.05–0.09 mm, the laser power is 200–350 W, and the average surface roughness value is (15.1±3) µm. The average surface hardness reaches HV404±HV3, higher than the forging standard range of HV340–HV395. Increasing the LED within the experiment range can increase the surface hardness, yet an excessively high LED will not further increase the surface hardness. The microstructure is composed of needle-like α′-phases with a length of about 20 µm, in a crisscross ‘N’ shape, when the LED is low. The β-phase grain boundary is not obvious, and the secondary-phase volume fraction is high; when the LED is high, the α′-phase of the microstructure is in the form of coarse slats, and the secondary-phase is composed of a small amount of secondary α′-phase, the tertiary α′-phase and the fourth α′-phase disappear, and the volume fraction of the secondary-phase becomes low. © 2022, Central South University.","laser energy density;

However, generation of cardiac tissue is still hampered by lack of adequate mechanical properties and crucially by the often unpredictable post-fabrication evolution of biological components. In this study we employ melt electrowriting (MEW) and hiPSC-derived cardiac cells to generate fibre-reinforced human cardiac minitissues. These are thoroughly characterized in order to build computational models and simulations able to predict their post-fabrication evolution. Our results show that MEW-based human minitissues display advanced maturation 28 post-generation, with a significant increase in the expression of cardiac genes such as MYL2, GJA5, SCN5A and the MYH7/MYH6 and MYL2/MYL7 ratios. Human iPSC-cardiomyocytes are significantly more aligned within the MEW-based 3D tissues, as compared to conventional 2D controls, and also display greater expression of C ×43. These are also correlated with a more mature functionality in the form of faster conduction velocity. We used these data to develop simulations capable of accurately reproducing the experimental performance. In-depth gauging of the structural disposition (cellular alignment) and intercellular connectivity (C ×43) allowed us to develop an improved computational model able to predict the relationship between cardiac cell alignment and functional performance. This study lays down the path for advancing in the development of in silico tools to predict cardiac biofabricated tissue evolution after generation, and maps the route towards more accurate and biomimetic tissue manufacture. © 2022 The Author(s).

While the process is suitable for customized production in small quantities, the use of ME-printed features is often limited with regard to mechanical purposes due to the intrinsic anisotropic strength shortcoming, as parts can easily failure against a load in the transverse direction. In addition, the production speed for multiple parts is another major drawback preventing real competition with other mass manufacturing technologies. In this paper, we introduce an additive manufacturing strategy of shell pre-printing and core post-casting (referring as shell-core printing) that effectively enhances the isotropic strength and the production speed. Shell-core printing involves 3D printing a thin shell of the three-dimensional shape using the conventional ME method, followed by the injection and curing of a reinforcement resin inside the core. We show that the transverse strength of the layered shell can be reinforced by the core and that the reinforcement can be more effective when the shell-core interface roughness is effectively removed. Using an additional surface-polishing step between the pre-printing and the post-casting, the degree of isotropy with regard to the strength can be enhanced significantly from 0.4 to nearly 1, while the overall production time can also be reduced by half that in the conventional ME process. We also investigate the tensile behavior of the shell-core printed specimen and experimentally verify that the characteristics in general follow the classical theory of the rule of mixtures. In addition, we find that many different fracture modes exist in shell-core printed parts depending on the adhesive strength at the shell-core interface. We provide a theoretical criterion for the interfacial bonding energy which determines the different fracture behaviors and experimentally validate this in a mode II fracture test. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Adhesion strength; Composite material; Fracture energy; Material extrusion; Rule of mixture; Surface treatment","3D printers; Adhesives; Extrusion; Fracture; Fracture energy; Fracture testing; Mixtures; Reinforcement; Shells (structures); Tensile strength; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Composites material; Conventional materials; Material extrusion; Production speed; Rule of mixture; Shell core; Thin shells; Three-dimensional shape; Surface treatment","","","","","Ministry of Education, MOE; Ministry of Environment, MOE; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2019R1C1C1008267); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, KAIST; Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Alberta","This work was supported by the Department of Mechanical Engineering at KAIST , South Korea the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government ( MSIT ), South Korea (No. 2019R1C1C1008267 ) and the BK21 FOUR Program of the National Research Foundation Korea (NRF), MOE, South Korea grant funded by the Ministry of Education ( MOE ).","Rayna T., Striukova L., From rapid prototyping to home fabrication: how 3D printing is changing business model innovation, Technol.

To this aim, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA) are used for fabrication of specimens based on FDM technique. Since ratio of the specimen width to the hole diameter (W/D) has influence on the structural integrity of the part, we have printed specimens with two hole diameters. Particularly, specimens with W/D of 3 and 6 were designed and fabricated. Based on a series of tensile tests under static loading conditions, fracture load and stress–strain relationship of the plates are determined. Parallel to the experimental practice, a finite element model a series of finite element analyses were conducted to simulate cracking behavior of the aforementioned specimen. The model is based on phase-field fracture. The model parameters is calibrated based on the data from experiment or reported properties in the literature. Finally, results of the numerical calculations are reported which shows a very well agreement to those from experimental measurement. The outcome of this study can be utilized for future design, development, optimization, and next computational modeling of 3D-printed open-hole plates. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3D printing; Fracture; Open-hole plate; Phase-field fracture","3D modeling; 3D printers; Finite element method; Fracture mechanics; Plates (structural components); Stress analysis; Styrene; Tensile testing; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Experimental investigations; Hole diameter; Hole plates; Numerical investigations; Open holes; Open-hole plate; Phase fields; Phase-field fracture; Fracture","","","","","European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (EFRE-0200545)","This work as part of the project “Smart Production Design Center” (SmaP) is funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) under the program OP EFRE NRW 2014–2020 ( EFRE-0200545 )","Gibson I., Rosen D., Stucker B., Khorasani M., Additive Manufacturing Technologies, (2021); Tilford T., Stoyan S., Braun J., Janhsen J.C., Burgard M., Birch R., Bailey C., Design, manufacture and test for reliable 3D printed electronics packaging, Microelectron.

Bis-GMA based resin composites were used as control. Refractive indexes of resin matrixes were measured. Besides the depth of cure mentioned in ISO standard, double bond conversion (DC) and bottom/top Vickers hardness (VHN) ratio of resin composites were investigated to evaluate the curing depth. Physicochemical properties, such as flexural properties, volumetric shrinkage (VS), shrinkage stress (SS), water sorption (WS) and solubility (SL), and cytotoxicity of resin composites were tested and statistically analyzed (ANOVA, Tukey's, p = 0.05). The results showed that Bis-EFMA/TEGDMA resin matrixes had higher refractive indexes than Bis-GMA/TEGDMA resin matrixes. Viscosities of Bis-EFMA based DRCs were higher than Bis-GMA based DRCs. Bis-EFMA-based (50/50) DRC had comparable depth of cure, DC, and VHN as Bis-GMA-based (50/50) DRC (p > 0.05). Though Bis-EFMA/TEGDMA (60/40) had the highest refractive index in all resin matrix, the corresponding DRCs had the lowest depth of cure, DC, and bottom/top VHN ratio in all groups (p < 0.05). Replacing Bis-GMA with Bis-EFMA had no negative effect on flexural properties, WS and SL of DRCs, and could reduce VS and SS of DRCs. Results of CCK8 assay showed that all of DRCs had the same cytotoxicity (p > 0.05), and the thickness of sample had no influence on the cytotoxicity (p > 0.05). All the results indicated that Bis-EFMA could be used to replace Bis-GMA to prepare bulk-filled dental resin composites. According to the results of depth of cure, DC, and bottom/top VHN ratio, 50 wt/50 wt was more appropriate than 60 wt/40 wt as the mass ratio of Bis-EFMA and TEGDMA in the resin matrix for bulk-filled dental resin composites. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","BPA-Free;

However, AM still has limitations because of some defects. Thus, defect detection technology is essential for quality enhancement in the AM process. Super-resolution (SR) technology can be utilized to improve defect image quality and enhance defect extraction performance. This study proposes a defect extraction method for additive manufactured parts with improved learning-based image SR and the Canny algorithm (LSRC), which is based on direct mapping methodology. The LSRC method is compared with the bicubic interpolation algorithm and the neighbor embedding (NE) algorithm in SR reconstruction quality and robustness. The experimental results show that the proposed LSRC method achieves satisfactory performance in terms of the averaged information entropy (E), standard deviation (SD), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity (SSIM), which are 7.259, 45.301, 27.723, and 0.822, respectively. The accordingly average improvement rates of the E, SD, PSNR, and SSIM, are 0.45%, 7.15%, 5.85%, and 6.35% in comparison with the bicubic interpolation algorithm, while the comparison data are 0.97%, 13.40%, 10.55%, and 15.35% in terms of the NE algorithm. This indicates that the LSRC method is significantly better than the comparison algorithm in reconstruction quality and robustness, which is of great significance for the extraction and analysis of key defect information of additive manufactured parts. © 2022 Optica Publishing Group.","","3D printers; Amplitude modulation; Defects; Extraction; Image enhancement; Image quality; Interpolation; Learning algorithms; Optical resolving power; Signal to noise ratio; Bicubic interpolation; Canny algorithm; Defect extraction; Embedding algorithms; Extraction method; Image super resolutions; Interpolation algorithms; Neighbor embedding; Performance; Reconstruction quality; algorithm; article; embedding; entropy; extraction; image quality; learning; signal noise ratio; Additives","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52075100); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFA0701200)","Funding.

However, the increasingly delicate designs bring computational challenges for structural optimization paradigms, such as topology optimization (TO), since the design dimensionality increases with the resolutions. Two-scale TO paves an avenue for high-resolution structural design to alleviate this challenge. This paper investigates the efficacy of introducing function-based microstructures into the two-scale TO. Both isotropic and orthotropic microstructure are considered to develop this TO framework. Implicit functions are exploited to model the two classes of cellular materials, including triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) and Fourier series-based functions (FSF). The elasticity tensor of microstructures is computed with numerical homogenization. Then, a two-scale TO paradigm is formulated, and a gradient-based algorithm is proposed to simultaneously optimize the micro-scale structures and macro-scale material properties. Several engineering benchmark cases are tested with the proposed method, and experimental results reveal that using proposed microstructures leads to, at most, a (Formula presented.) decrease in the compliance of optimal structures. The proposed framework provides achievable directionality and broader design flexibility for high-resolution product development. © 2022 by the authors.","Fourier series-based functions; numerical homogenization; orthotropic microstructures; two-scale topology optimization","","","","","","","","Sigmund O., A 99 line topology optimization code written in Matlab, Struct.

To enhance productivity and reduce maintenance costs, an online supervision system is essential to check the status of SCs. This paper thus proposes an innovative method for condition monitoring of SCs coated with printed electronics whose electrical resistance is supposed to be correlated with the mechanical strain. A simulation model is first examined to observe the deformation of SCs under vacuum compression, which is needed for the development of sensor coating thanks to the 3D printing process. The proposed design involves three circle-shaped sensors, two for the top and bottom bellows (whose mechanical strains are revealed to be the most significant), and one for the lip (small strain, but important stress that might provoke wear and tear in the long term). For the sake of simplicity, practical measurement is performed on 2D samples coated with two different conductive inks subjected to unidirectional tensile loading. Graphical representations together with analytical models of both linear and nonlinear piezoresistive responses allows for the characterization of the inks’ behavior under several conditions of displacement and speed inputs. After a comparison of the two inks, the most appropriate is selected as a consequence of its excellent adhesion and stretchability, which are essential criteria to meet the target field. Room temperature extrusion-based 3D printing is then investigated using a motorized 3D Hyrel printer with a syringe-extrusion modular system. Design optimization is finally carried out to enhance the surface detection of sensitive elements while minimizing the effect of electrodes. Although several issues still need to be further considered to match specifications imposed by our industrial partner, the achievement of this work is meaningful and could pave the way for a new generation of SCs integrated with smart sensing devices. The 3D printing of conductive ink directly on the cup’s curving surface is a true challenge, which has been demonstrated, for the first time, to be technically feasible throughout the additive manufacturing (AM) process. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing additive manufacturing; condition monitoring; conductive coating; design optimization; ink characterization; piezoresistive sensor; printed electronics","3D printers; Additives; Coatings; Extrusion; Materials handling; Printing presses; Strain; Tensile strength; 3-D printing; 3d printing additive manufacturing; 3D-printing; Conductive coatings; Design optimization; Ink characterization; Piezoresistive sensors; Printed electronics; Printing additives; Suction cup; Condition monitoring","","","","","","","Mobley R.K., An Introduction to Predictive Maintenance, (2002); Cui Z., Printed Electronics: Materials, Technologies and Applications, (2016); Alberto M., Micaela D., Sarbjeet S., Applications and Challenges of Maintenance and Safety Engineering in Industry 4.0, (2020); Le M.Q., Capsal J.-F., Lallart M., Hebrard Y., Van Der Ham A., Reffe N., Geynet L., Cottinet P.-J., Review on energy harvesting for structural health monitoring in aeronautical applications, Prog.

Usually, these heat exchangers are exposed to high thermal and pressure gradients, which can cause structural failures during the operation. A new fabrication method employing additive manufacturing was evaluated to produce that equipment in this context. Twelve samples of 316L stainless steel that simulated a heat exchanger geometry were fabricated in two machines. A test rig was constructed for hydrostatic tests to evaluate their structural integrity through strain gauges. Some samples were submitted to pressures up to 700 bar without any leakage. The results show that printing orientation is crucial to the process, which influences material properties and, consequently, the von Mises stress observed. Properties on vertical orientation present lower stress levels. The influence of heat treatment was also verified, showing that machining processes locally alter mechanical properties. In parallel, a numerical study was developed for structural evaluation. It was observed that the pressurization of the distribution chamber strongly influences the stress of prototype channels. The high-stress region does not surpass the material yield strength for the test pressure. Furthermore, any deformation on the experimental prototype was not observed, indicating that the geometric characteristics guarantee a structural integer of the heat exchanger core. It is highlighted that the numerical results proved a good adherence to experimental results. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Compact heat exchanger","Additives; Fabrication; Failure (mechanical); Fracture mechanics; Geometry; Heat exchangers; Heat transfer; Machining; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Compact heat exchanger; Configuration characteristics; Exposed to; Geometric configurations; Heat transfer area; High pressure; High thermal; Structural failure; 3D printers","","","","","Agência Nacional de Petróleo; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa e Inovação do Estado de Santa Catarina, FAPESC","We would like to express our gratitude to SENAI/JOINVILLE, FAPESC , CAPES , CNPq , PETROBRAS S.A and ANP (Agência Nacional de Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustível) from Brazil for supporting this research.","Incropera F.P., Incropera F.P., Fundamentals of Heat and Mass Transfer, (2007); Shah R.K., Sekulic D.P., Fundamentals of Heat Exchanger Design, (2003); Liu G., Huang Y., Wang J., Liu R., A review on the thermal-hydraulic performance and optimization of printed circuit heat exchangers for supercritical CO2 in advanced nuclear power systems, Renew.

The properties are inversely determined using only a few experimental tests. Developing composite manufacturing digital twins for SFRP composite processes, including injection molding and extrusion deposition additive manufacturing (EDAM) requires extensive experimental material characterization. In particular, characterizing the composite mechanical properties is time consuming and therefore, micromechanics models are used to fully identify the elasticity tensor. Hence, the objective of this paper is to infer the fiber orientation and the effective polymer modulus and therefore, identify the elasticity tensor of the composite with minimal experimental tests. To that end, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model coupled with a micromechanics model to infer the fiber orientation and the polymer elastic modulus simultaneously which we then use to estimate the composite elasticity tensor. We motivate and demonstrate the methodology for the EDAM process but the development is such that it is applicable to other SFRP composites processed via other methods. Our results demonstrate that the approach provides a reliable framework for the inference, with as few as three tensile tests, while accounting for epistemic and aleatory uncertainty. Posterior predictive checks show that the model is able to recreate the experimental data well. The ability of the Bayesian approach to calibrate the material properties and its associated uncertainties, make it a promising tool for enabling a probabilistic predictive framework for composites manufacturing digital twins. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Bayesian inference; Elastic properties; Extrusion deposition additive manufacturing; Fiber orientation; Gaussian process surrogate; Short fiber composites","3D printers; Additives; Bayesian networks; Elastic moduli; Elasticity; Extrusion; Fibers; Inference engines; Injection molding; Reinforcement; Tensile testing; Tensors; Bayesian inference; Elastic properties; Elasticity tensor; Extrusion deposition additive manufacturing; Fiber reinforced polymer composites; Fibre orientation; Gaussian process surrogate; Gaussian Processes; Short Fiber; Short fibre composites; Deposition","","","","","Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation, (DOE DE-EE0006926, PA16-0349-3.12-01); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE","This research was sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy, Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation (IACMI) , under contract DOE DE-EE0006926 , IACMI PA16-0349-3.12-01 .","Tseng H.-C., Chang R.-Y., Hsu C.-H., Numerical prediction of fiber orientation and mechanical performance for short/long glass and carbon fiber-reinforced composites, Compos.

The key advantage of DIW is the ability to spatially control both the architecture and the composition of the printed part, which enables the production of components with previously unachievable combinations of functionalities. One emergent application space for DIW has been in additively manufactured glass optics, where a “green body” is patterned layer-by-layer by extruding a silica-based slurry through a microfluidic nozzle and then thermally consolidated to transparent glass. A critical aspect of the process is ensuring that the printed part is completely free of voids that can occur in the interstitial spaces between the extruded filaments. This outcome is governed by the interplay between ink rheology and strains imposed by the printing process and geometric packing of the filaments. Here, we explore the strain- and rate-dependent deformation events in the DIW process to determine conditions that enable the printing of void-free monoliths without sacrificing shape fidelity. We focus on yield stress fluids consisting of fumed silica nanoparticles dispersed in organic solvents at varied volume fractions to control the rheological properties. We investigate the printability of these ink materials as a function of print process variables and devise the appropriate dimensionless parameters that capture the geometry-dependent and rate-dependent effects on the deformation of the extruded ink. Finally, we use these scaling arguments to construct a phase diagram for void-free monolith printability.

The objective of the current study was to evaluate the influence of flow driven shear stress on the viability of cultured cells inside the luminal wall of a serpentine network. Fluid–structure interaction was modeled using COMSOL Multiphysics for representing the elasticity of the serpentine wall. Experimental analysis of the serpentine model was performed on the basis of a desirable inlet flow boundary condition for which the most homogeneously distributed wall shear stress had been obtained from numerical study. A blend of Gelatin-methacryloyl (GelMA) and PEGDA200 PhotoInk was used as a bioink for printing the serpentine network, while facilitating cell growth within the pores of the gelatin substrate. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were seeded into the channels of the network to simulate the blood vessels. A Live-Dead assay was performed over a period of 14 days to observe the cellular viability in the printed vascular channels. It was observed that cell viability increases when the seeded cells were exposed to the evenly distributed shear stresses at an input flow rate of 4.62 mm/min of the culture media, similar to that predicted in the numerical model with the same inlet boundary condition. It leads to recruitment of a large number of focal adhesion point nodes on cellular membrane, emphasizing the influence of such phenomena on promoting cellular morphologies. © 2022 by the authors.","cellular viability; fluid structure interaction; mechanotransduction; serpentine channels; shear stress","Blood vessels; Boundary conditions; Cell proliferation; Endothelial cells; Fluid structure interaction; Serpentine; Shear flow; Bioprinting; Cell-be; Cell/B.E; Cell/BE; Cellular viability; Fluid-structure interaction; In-vitro; Mechanotransduction; Numerical and experimental analysis; Serpentine channel; Shear stress","","","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (SPARC/2018-2019/140/SL); National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA","This research received funding from NASA Florida Space Grant Program and “SPARC [SPARC/2018-2019/140/SL (IN)]”.","Mount C., Dusserrre N., McAllister T., L'Heureux N., Tissue-engineered cardiovascular grafts and novel applications of tissue engineering by self-assembly (TESATM), Cardiac Regeneration and Repair: Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, pp. 410-451, (2014); Ng H.Y., Lee K.-X.A., Kuo C.-N., Shen Y.-F., Bioprinting of artificial blood vessels, Int.

The ability of blending the torque during gear shifts from one clutch to the other, making the type of automated transmission a perfect alternative to torque converters, which also comes with a higher efficiency. Nevertheless, DCT also have some drawbacks. The actuation of two clutches requires an immense control effort, which is handled in the implementation of a wide range of software functions on the transmission control unit (TCU). These usually contain control parameters, which makes the behavior adaptable to different vehicle and engine platforms. The adaption of these parameters is called calibration, which is usually an iterative time-consuming process. The calibration of the embedded software solutions in control units is a widely known problem in the automotive industry. The calibration of any vehicle subsystem (e.g., engine, transmission, suspension, driver assistance systems for autonomous driving, etc.) requires costly test trips in different ambient conditions. To reduce the calibration effort and the accompanying use of professionals, several approaches to automize the calibration process are proposed. Due to the fact that a solution is desired which can optimize different calibration problems, a generic metaheuristic approach is aimed. Regardless, the scope of the current research is the optimization of the launch behavior for vehicles equipped with DCT since, particularly at low speeds, the transmission behavior must meet the intention of the driver (drivers tend to be more perceptive at low speeds). To clarify the characteristics of the launch, several test subject studies are performed. The influence factors, such as engine sound, maximal acceleration, acceleration build-up (mean jerk), and the reaction time, are taken into account. Their influence on the evaluation of launch with relation to the criteria of sportiness, comfort, and jerkiness, are examined based on the evaluation of the test subject studies. According to the results of the study, reference values for the optimization of the launch behavior are derived. The research contains a study of existing approaches for optimizing driving behavior with metaheuristics (e.g., genetic algorithms, reinforcement learning, etc.). Since the existing approaches have different drawbacks (in scope of the optimization problem) a new approach is proposed, which outperforms existing ones. The approach itself is a hybrid solution of reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised learning (SL) and is applied in a software in the loop environment, and in a test vehicle. © 2022 by the authors.","deep learning; driving behavior; dual clutch transmission; launch evaluation; launch optimization; machine learning; parameter optimization; reinforcement learning","","","","","","Technical University of Darmstadt; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG","We acknowledge support by the Deutsche Forschungs- gemeinschaft (DFG—German Research Foundation) and the Open Access Publishing Fund of Technical University of Darmstadt.","Schmiedt M., Pawlenka A., Rinderknecht S., AI-based parameter optimization method-applied for vehicles with dual clutch transmissions, Proceedings of the 22 Internationales Stuttgarter Symposium, 2, pp. 337-353, (2022); Wehbi K., Bestle D., Beilharz J., Automatic calibration process for optimal control of clutch engagement during launch, Mech.

This approach allows for the printing of complicated shaped objects and is quickly gaining traction in the aerospace, medical implant, jewelry, footwear, automotive, and fashion industries. AM, which was formerly used for single part customization, is currently being considered for mass customization of parts because of its positive impacts. However, part quality and build time are two main impediments to the deployment of AM for mass production. The optimal part orientation is fundamental for maximizing the part’s quality as well as being critical for reducing the fabrication time. This research provides a new method for multi-part AM production that improves quality while reducing overall build time. The automatic setup planning or orientation approach described in this paper employs two objective functions: the quality of the build component and the build time. To tackle the given problem, it introduces a three-step genetic algorithm (GA)-based solution. A feature-based technique is utilized to generate a collection of finite alternative orientations for each component within a specific part group to ensure each part’s individual build quality. Then, a GA was utilized to find the best combination of part build orientations at a global optimal level to reduce material consumption and build time. A case study of orienting nine components concurrently inside a given building chamber was provided for illustration. The findings suggest that the developed technique can increase quality, reduce support waste, and shorten overall production time. When components are positioned optimally rather than in random orientations, build time and support volume are reduced by approximately 7% and 16%, respectively. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; build orientation; genetic algorithm; mass production; optimization","3D printers; Additives; Computer aided design; Fabrication; Build orientation; Build time; Computer aided design models; Layer by layer; Manufacturing IS; Mass production; Medical implants; Optimisations; Part orientation; Three-dimensional (3D) objects; Genetic algorithms","","","","","Raytheon Chair for Systems Engineering","The authors are grateful to the Raytheon Chair for Systems Engineering for funding.

Despite these advantages, product design engineering teams—those who develop physical products—have not widely adopted this working style due to perceived critical dependence on physical facilities and the belief that it is ineffective to communicate technical details virtually. This paper uses the mass shift in working conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to explore the feasibility of virtual and distributed work in product design engineering. We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with product design engineers working virtually to uncover current challenges of, and the beginning of promising strategies for, effective virtual engineering work. We categorize and analyze Tangible Design activities, Intangible Design activities, and Communication and Project Management activities throughout the product design process. Contrary to present opinions, we found that much of a product design engineer's work is realizable in a virtual and distributed setting. However, there are still many challenges, especially when attempting Tangible Design activities—those that require physical products and tools—from home. These challenges, missing from existing virtual product design engineering literature, include but are not limited to individuals’ lessened sense of accountability, fewer de-risking opportunities before product sign-off, and limited supervision of production staff. Product design engineers described novel strategies that emerged organically to mitigate these challenges, such as creating digital alternatives for engineering reviews and sign-offs and leveraging rapid prototyping. Recent advances in technology, an increased commitment to reducing environmental impact, and better work-life balance expectations from new generations of workers will only push society faster towards a distributed working model.

This study aims to propose an optimized and state-of-the-art machine learning model to predict the EPB-FP as accurately as possible. To this end, a support vector regression SVR model and six metaheuristic optimization algorithms of particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimization (GWO), multiverse optimization (MVO), moth flame optimization (MFO), sine cosine algorithm (SCA), and social spider optimization (SSO) were developed to predict the FP in the EPB tunnelling. 250 data sets, including seven input parameters and one output parameter (FP) were utilized in the models obtained from the Tehran metro Line 3. Finally, the performance prediction of the models from high to low was SVR–PSO,SVR–GWO,SVR–MVO,SVR–MFO,SVR–SCA,SVR–SSO, and SVR with ranking scores of 55,49,45,39,37,30, and 21, respectively. Therefore, the SVR–PSO hybrid model produced the most accurate results and it was recommended to predict the FP in the EPB tunnelling. In addition, using the mutual information test, the surface load (SL) parameter was identified as the most influential parameter on the FP. This work’s significance is that it allows geotechnical engineers to accurately estimate the FP during the EPB tunnelling, which ensures the safety of the excavation itself, helps to minimize surface settlement, and ultimately prevents the collapse of the entire tunnel. Also, it can prevent the time-consuming and cost overruns that the FP may cause during the EPB tunnelling. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","EPB shield tunnelling;

The database was established by collecting published reports on the annealing treatment of selective laser melting (SLM) Ti6Al4V, from 2006 to 2020. Using the established model, it is possible to prescribe annealing parameters and predict properties after annealing for SLM Ti-6Al-4V parts with high confidence. The model shows high accuracy in the prediction of yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS). It is found that the YS and UTS are sensitive to the annealing parameters, including temperature and holding time. The YS and UTS are also sensitive to initial YS and UTS of as-printed parts. The model suggests that an annealing process of the holding time of fewer than 4 h and the holding temperature lower than 850°C is desirable for as-printed Ti6Al4V parts to reach the YS required by the ASTM standard. By studying the collected data of microstructure and tensile properties of annealed Ti6Al4V, a new Hall-Petch relationship is proposed to correlate grain size and YS for annealed SLM Ti6Al4V parts in this work. The prediction of strain to failure shows lower accuracy compared with the predictions of YS and UTS due to the large scattering of the experimental data collected from the published reports.  © 2022 The Author(s).

To this end, an integrated fuzzy multi-criteria-decision-making (fuzzy MCDM) method was used to identify the criteria affecting sustainable material selection. The proposed approach consists of a three-phase protocol: In phase I, the literature was used to create a database encompassing 42 factors affecting the selection of materials. These factors were classified as four indicators (economic, environmental, socio-cultural, technical-executive) in accordance with the sustainable development aspects. In phase II, the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) was used to screen the key factors. In phase III, an integrated fuzzy SWARA–ARAS method was used to prioritize the optimal structural system for a case project: evidence from Iran. The results of selecting the structural systems based on 14 efficient key factors showed that the Light Steel Frame (LSF), Insulation Concrete framework (ICF), and the Prefabricated Reinforced Concrete System (PRC) systems have the highest priority to achieve the goals of sustainable material selection, respectively. © 2022 by the authors.","integrated fuzzy MCDM approach; mass-housing projects; optimal structural systems; sustainable materials","integrated approach; methodology; multicriteria analysis; project assessment; sustainability","","","","","","","Jahan A., Ismaeil M.Y., Sapuan S.M., Mustapha F., Material screening and choosing methods—A review, Mater.

In this study, the microstructure and mechanical properties of Inconel 625 alloy and Y2O3 strengthened Inconel 625 alloy prepared by SLM were investigated comparatively. The highest density for Y2O3/Inconel 625 specimen with a value of 99.6% was achieved when the laser volume energy density is around 145.8 J/mm3. Compared with Inconel 625 specimen, there presents a larger molten pool, finer grain structure, and weaker texture along the deposition direction in Y2O3/Inconel 625 specimen due to the active flux effect of Y2O3. During the heat treatment, the grain growth and annealing twin formation are inhibited in Y2O3/Inconel 625 specimen due to the pinning effect of Y2O3 particles. The yield strength of Inconel 625 specimen increases by 11.4%, 22.0%, and 12.5% at 20, 800, and 1100 °C, respectively, due to the dispersion strengthening and grain boundary strengthening induced by the addition of 0.48 wt % Y2O3 particles. In addition, the elongation of Y2O3/Inconel 625 specimen at high temperature is improved because of the contribution of Y2O3 to the strengthening and oxidation resistance of grain boundaries. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Oxide dispersion strengthened; Selective laser melting; Superalloys","Dispersions; Grain boundaries; Grain growth; Melting; Oxidation resistance; Superalloys; Textures; Fine grain structure; High cooling rates; Inconel 625; Inconel 625 alloys; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Molten pool; Oxide dispersion strengthened; Oxide dispersion strengthened alloys; Selective laser melting; Volume energy density; Selective laser melting","","","","","National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFB0704101); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","The work was supported by the National Key R&D Plan of China (Grant No. 2018YFB0704101 ).","Pasebani S., Dutt A.K., Burns J., Charit I., Mishra R.S., Oxide dispersion strengthened nickel based alloys via spark plasma sintering, Mater.

However, the performance of InGaN TE materials is limited by the high thermal conductivity (k) and the conflict coupling between the power factor (PF) and the k. Here, the previously unstudied two-dimensional InGaN/GaN SL structured TE device with a high In composition of 31% was developed and demonstrated to improve the TE figure of merit (ZT, Z = PF/k) by reducing the k value without deteriorating the PF. The Seebeck coefficient (S) exhibited a value of − 365 μV/K due to the increased density of electron states near the Fermi level by the low dimensional construction. Simultaneously, a relatively low k was obtained as 7.7 W/m·K, benefitting from the alloying and SL interface scattering effect of high energy phonons. Moreover, enhancement of the Umklapp process by the space confinement effect further lowers the k. Accordingly, a record ZT value of 0.089 at 300 K was achieved, which was better than previously reported values for GaN-based TE film materials. This work provides a new material system for improving the performance of nitride TE materials at HTs and extends the fields of application in electricity harvesting from waste heat. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","InGaN/GaN superlattice; Seebeck coefficient; Thermal conductivity; Thermoelectric; ZT","Gallium alloys; Gallium nitride; III-V semiconductors; Indium alloys; Seebeck coefficient; Semiconductor alloys; Waste heat; Highest temperature; InGaN/GaN; InGaN/GaN superlattice; Performance; Power factors; Thermo-Electric materials; Thermoelectric; Thermoelectric devices; Thermoelectric material; ZT; Thermal conductivity","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51720105007, 61974140, 62174157); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFB3600401)","This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2021YFB3600401 ), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61974140 , 62174157 and 51720105007 ).

In this work, we investigate the explanations of these anomalies in the R-parity violating minimal supersymmetric standard model (RPV-MSSM) extended with the inverse seesaw mechanism. The non-unitarity extent ηee and the loop corrections from the interaction λ′L^ Q^ D^ are utilized to raise the prediction of W mass through muon decays. We also find that the interaction λ′L^ Q^ D^ involved with right-handed (RH)/singlet (s)neutrinos can explain the RK(∗) and RD(∗) anomalies simultaneously when considering nonzero λ1jk′. For nonzero λ2jk′, this model fulfills the whole b→ sℓ+ℓ- fit but cannot be accordant with RD(∗) measurements. The explanations in both cases are also favored by (g- 2) μ data, neutrino oscillation data and the relevant constraints we scrutinized. Furthermore, this model framework can be tested in future experiments covering, e.g., the predicted lepton flavor violations (LFV) at Belle II and the Future Circular Collider with e+e- beams (FCC-ee), as well as the heavy neutrinos at future colliders. © 2022, The Author(s).","","","","","","","Sun Yat-Sen University Science Foundation; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (PTDC/CCI-BIO/29266/2017); CCNU-QLPL Innovation Fund, (QLPL2021P01); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11875327)","We thank Seishi Enomoto for valuable discussions.

Owing to the recent advances in additive manufacturing technology, TO has been developed in connection with the use of microscale lattices, of which complicated geometries require considerable computational loads to verify their structural performance. This study aims to develop an efficient computational method to analyze a complex TO model. Computational homogenization was then developed for efficient computation of the TO model that contains a number of microscale lattices. The proposed homogenization scheme was then applied to perform three-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis (FEA) on various TO models with three scales (i.e., macroscale, microscale, and multiscale TOs). The homogenized FEAs were conducted to verify the static and dynamic deformation behaviors of three optimized meta-sandwich beams, and their results and computational efficiency were compared with those from full solid FEAs. Experimental verification revealed that the proposed homogenized FEA provided more reliable results and better computational efficiency for the microscale and multiscale TO models, whereas the conventional solid FEA was advantageous for the macroscale TO model. To apply the proposed simulation strategy to a more complex 3D geometry, three TO models were calculated for a 3D block under a compression load. The simulation strategy combining the full solid and homogenized FEAs was then applied to analyze the static and dynamic deformation behaviors of various TO models, which provided reliable predictions of the experimentally observed behaviors within an acceptable computational time.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Therefore, it is of theoretical and practical significance to study the green economic effect and carbon reduction effect of tourism development for the transformation of economic development. Using the superefficient EBM to measure the green economic efficiency of 280 cities from 2007–2019, we rely on the spatial Durbin model to explore the spatial spillover utility and nonlinear characteristic relationship of tourism development on green economic efficiency and carbon emission intensity and test the mediating effect of carbon emission intensity. The findings are as follows: (1) Under the exogenous shock test of the “low-carbon city” pilot policy, the spatial spillover effect of tourism development on urban green economic efficiency and carbon emission intensity is robust to spatial heterogeneity. (2) The spatial spillover effects of tourism development on the green economic efficiency and carbon emission intensity of cities show a nonlinear characteristic relationship of “U” and “M” shapes. After tourism development reaches a certain high level, the green economy effect and carbon emission reduction effect are significantly increased. (3) Carbon emission intensity has a significant mediating effect on the impact of tourism development on urban green economic efficiency. © 2022 by the authors.","carbon emissions; green economy; spillover effect; superefficient EBM; tourism development","Carbon; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Carbon emission intensities; Carbon emissions; Economic efficiency; Green economies; Mediating effect; Nonlinear characteristics; Reduction effects; Spillover effects; Superefficient EBM; Tourism development; Economic efficiency","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2022JJ30387); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province; National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (21FGLB070); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS","This research was funded by the National Social Science Foundation, grant number 21FGLB070, and Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, grant number 2022JJ30387.","Raihan A., Tuspekova A., The nexus between economic growth, energy use, urbanization, tourism, and carbon dioxide emissions: New insights from Singapore, Sustain.

Although the first international clinical breakthrough of tissue-engineered auricular reconstruction has been realized based on polymer scaffolds, this approach has not been recognized as a clinically available treatment because of its unsatisfactory clinical efficacy. This is mainly since reconstruction constructs easily cause inflammation and deformation. In this study, we present a novel strategy for the development of biological auricle equivalents with precise shapes, low immunogenicity, and excellent mechanics using auricular chondrocytes and a bioactive bioink based on biomimetic microporous methacrylate-modified acellular cartilage matrix (ACMMA) with the assistance of gelatin methacrylate (GelMA), poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), and polycaprolactone (PCL) by integrating multi-nozzle bioprinting technology. Photocrosslinkable ACMMA is used to emulate the intricacy of the cartilage-specific microenvironment for active cellular behavior, while GelMA, PEO, and PCL are used to balance printability and physical properties for precise structural stability, form the microporous structure for unhindered nutrient exchange, and provide mechanical support for higher shape fidelity, respectively. Finally, mature auricular cartilage-like tissues with high morphological fidelity, excellent elasticity, abundant cartilage lacunae, and cartilage-specific ECM deposition are successfully regenerated in vivo, which provides new opportunities and novel strategies for the fabrication and regeneration of patient-specific auricular cartilage. © 2022 The Authors","3D bioprinting; Auricular cartilage regeneration; Bioactive bioink; Microporous; Photocrosslinkable acellular cartilage matrix","biomimetic material; gelatin; macrogol 10000; methacrylic acid; polycaprolactone; animal cell; Article; biocompatibility; biomechanics; bioprinting; cell cycle assay; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell viability; chondrocyte; cross linking; ear cartilage; enzymatic degradation; flow kinetics; gene ontology; gravimetry; histology; immunofluorescence assay; immunogenicity; immunohistochemistry; KEGG; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; microenvironment; morphology; nanofabrication; nonhuman; protein protein interaction; proteomics; regeneration; three-dimensional imaging","","gelatin, 9000-70-8; methacrylic acid, 18358-13-9, 79-41-4; polycaprolactone, 24980-41-4, 25248-42-4","Q Exactive, Thermo","Thermo","Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences, (2017-I2M-1-007, 2021-I2M-1-052); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81871502, 81871575); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFC1103900); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2017YFC1103900 ), the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences ( 2017-I2M-1-007 , 2021-I2M-1-052 ), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 81871502 , 81871575 ).

It is critical to precisely realize the designed unit cell geometry so that desired properties can be achieved. Owing to its high-level freedom in design and fabrication, additive manufacturing (AM) has been increasingly leveraged for the production of mechanical metamaterials. However, geometric defects largely exist in AM products. The gap between “as-designed” and “as-built” unit cell geometries will compromise the properties of the printed metamaterial and even cause safety hazards for mission-critical applications. This study develops a novel framework that harnesses in-situ point cloud sensing and analytics for the detection and characterization of geometric defects in additively manufactured mechanical metamaterials. Specifically, upon the printing of each layer, a point cloud is obtained to capture the geometries of unit cells. A recurrence plot based approach is developed to characterize how each printed unit cell departs from the as-designed counterpart. After that, we integrate low-rank tensor decomposition with one-class classification to determine whether the unit cells on the printed layer are associated with geometric defects. Results of simulations and real-world experiments have shown that the developed framework effectively handles the complexity of mechanical metamaterials and characterizes geometric defects for online quality assurance. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Additive manufacturing; Metamaterials; One-class classification; Point clouds; Tensor decomposition","Additives; Cells; Cytology; Defects; Geometry; Metamaterials; Quality assurance; Tensors; Cell geometries; Cloud-based; Geometric defects; Mechanical; On-line detection; One-class Classification; Point-clouds; Property; Tensor decomposition; Unit cells; 3D printers","","","","","University of Texas at Arlington, UTA","This work was supported in part by the Research Enhancement Program of The University of Texas at Arlington .

The use of a second process, for example, machining, improves the surface finish and in this case, the use of two processes is known as hybrid manufacturing. Heat treatments are often performed on parts generated by the AM process, mainly to relieve the residual stresses generated, but for some materials, this can decrease the pitting corrosion resistance of the parts. The objective of this study is to analyze the effect of hybrid manufacturing (AM + machining) on residual stresses and pitting resistance corrosion, which can bring advantages to piece properties without the use of heat treatment. 316L stainless steel parts are generated by direct laser metal sintering (DLMS), with subsequent milling using a complete factorial planning for the design of the experiments. The cutting speed, feed rate, cutting depth, use of the cutting fluid and laser power in the DLMS process are all varied. Residual stresses are measured by X-ray diffraction and the blind hole method, with polarization curves raised by a potentiostat. The results show that it is possible to reduce the residual surface stresses in the parts, even for compressive stresses, and to improve the pitting corrosion resistance, when compared to the part without milling, depending on the cutting parameters used. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.","Additive manufacturing; Hybrid machining; Pitting resistance corrosion; Residual stress","3D printers; Additives; Austenitic stainless steel; Compressive stress; Corrosion resistance; Milling (machining); Pitting; Steel corrosion; Voltage regulators; 'current; 316 L stainless steel; Direct laser metal sintering; Hybrid machining; Manufacturing IS; Pitting corrosion resistance; Pitting resistance; Pitting resistance corrosion; Stress corrosion resistance; Surface finishes; Residual stresses","","","","","Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2020/09163-3); Maua Institute of Technology and São Paulo Research Foundation, (2020/10653-5)","Authors would like to thank to the Maua Institute of Technology and S\u00E3o Paulo Research Foundation (Grant # 2020/10653-5, FAPESP; and Grant # 2020/09163-3, FAPESP) for the financial support.

In this case, the use of biological material in composite structure have been increased in this century. The main idea of this research is to use a bio-based material in sandwich composite structure dedicated to transport industrial applications. Also, auxetic structures have presented a good mechanical property such as higher stiffness, strength, and energy absorption. This study presents an experimental analysis of the static and dynamic properties of a bio-sandwich composite with conventional honeycomb and auxetic core. An additive manufacturing technique is used to produce the sandwich composites. Static tensile, static and fatigue three-point bending and vibration tests were used to characterize the tested sandwiches. The effect of the bio-based material, the number of cells in the core as well as the core topology are investigated. The Young modulus and ultimate strength and strain under tensile tests are determined for the two tested material which are the polylactic acid and the polylactic acid reinforced with flax fibers. Also, the static bending stiffness is calculated for each sandwich configurations. The loss factor is calculated under vibration tests. The determined properties in this study, give a large idea on the comportment of bio-sandwich with conventional honeycomb and auxetic core under a diverse test. It was found that sandwich made with polylactic acid and high number of cells presents the highest stiffness. However, sandwich made with polylactic acid reinforced with flax fibers and auxetic core improves the dissipated energy and damping properties. © 2022, Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society.

This technique will demonstrate a promising potential for large-area inspection of composite structures in near real time to unearth barely visible impact damage (BVID) which would typically go unnoticed during routine inspections. Three image (processing) algorithms for localizing and then imaging the BVID area were explored: conventional mean squared error (MSE), normalized cross-correlation (NCC), and an index-centered algorithm known as structural similarity index measure (SSIM). When implementing these algorithms in LSP, a pre-processing step of selecting a window size (subregion size) for locally correlating the images to localize the damage and estimate its size was performed as an advancement on the previous pixel-by-pixel correlations made with LSP. A trade-off strategy between two perceptual-based metrics, image fidelity and image sharpness/blurriness, was implemented to evaluate an appropriate range for window sizes followed by the image algorithms for creating high contrast imaging of damage regions. From the correlation map, the strategy was carried out to mitigate image noise caused by the camera (image) sensors and speckle patterns dictated by the overall root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) while maintaining a high level of sharpness characterized by the magnitude of the third-level discrete wavelet transform. The proposed image algorithms in conjunction with the appropriately selected window size served as imaging conditions in the context of laser speckles for the first time and were tested on BVID in an impacted honeycomb composite panel under thermal excitation. A low coherence (high-power) laser for fast screening of a large area, if required, followed by a high coherence (low-power laser) for detailed imaging were used to demonstrate the efficacy of LSP. The damage image region agreed well with a baseline image from the well-established point-by-point CT-scan with all the three image algorithms. Overall, NCC and SSIM performed slightly better than MSE, with SSIM generally being the better of the two. Nevertheless, MSE has its merits with ease of interpretation and implementation. LSP with the proposed imaging conditions shows enormous potential as a real-time non-destructive inspection (NDI) technique not only in the aerospace industry but also in industries such as additive manufacturing where on-line in-situ monitoring is desired for prevalent defects. The real-time inspection using LSP will further allow immediate feedback for process controls. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Barely visible impact damage; Honeycomb composite panel; Laser speckle photometry; Mean squared error; Normalized cross correlation; Optimized window size; Structural similarity index measure","Computerized tomography; Discrete wavelet transforms; Economic and social effects; Honeycomb structures; Image enhancement; Interferometry; Pixels; Speckle; Stars; Barely visible impact damages; Composite panels; Honeycomb composite; Honeycomb composite panel; Laser speckle; Laser speckle photometry; Mean squared error; Normalized cross-correlation; Optimized window size; Optimized windows; Similarity indices; Structural similarity; Structural similarity index measure; Window Size; Mean square error","","","","","Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering; National Institute of Aerospace; North Carolina Space; North Carolina State University, NCSU","Funding text 1: The work was performed at the National Institute of Aerospace (NIA), Hampton, Virginia.

This routing technique is done by many different methods, with the most common using integer linear programming problem (ILP), building optimal routing metrics. These methods often only focus on one routing objective, such as minimizing the packet blocking probability, minimizing end-to-end delay (EED), and maximizing network throughput. It is difficult to consider multiple objectives concurrently in a routing algorithm. In this paper, we investigate the application of machine learning to control routing in the SDWN. An intelligent routing algorithm is then proposed based on the machine learning to improve the network performance. The proposed algorithm can optimize multiple routing objectives. Our idea is to combine supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL) methods to discover new routes. The SL is used to predict the performance metrics of the links, including EED quality of transmission (QoT), and packet blocking probability (PBP). The routing is done by the RL method. We use the Q-value in the fundamental equation of the RL to store the PBP, which is used for the aim of route selection. Concurrently, the learning rate coefficient is flexibly changed to determine the constraints of routing during learning. These constraints include QoT and EED. Our performance evaluations based on OMNeT++ have shown that the proposed algorithm has significantly improved the network performance in terms of the QoT, EED, packet delivery ratio, and network throughput compared with other well-known routing algorithms. 1225-6463/$ © 2022 ETRI.","intelligent routing; reinforcement learning; SDWN; supervised learning","Blocking probability; Integer programming; Learning algorithms; Network performance; Routing algorithms; Supervised learning; Wireless networks; End to end delay; Intelligent routing; Intelligent routing algorithm; Machine-learning; Packet blocking; Quality of Transmission; Reinforcement learnings; Routings; Software-defined wireless networking; Wireless networking; Reinforcement learning","","","","","","","Abdelaziz A., Fong A., Gani A., Khan S., Alotaibi F., Khan M., On software-defined wireless network (SDWN) network virtualization: Challenges and open issues, Comput.

In this study, AlCoCrFeNi2.1 EHEA with a fully nano-lamella structure was prepared by selective laser melting (SLM). Furthermore, massive L12 and BCC nano-precipitates were precipitated out from the FCC and B2 phases, respectively. Compared to AlCoCrFeNi2.1 EHEA prepared by traditional methods, the SLM-ed EHEA sample shows excellent strength and ductility synergy, with the yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and uniform elongation determined as 1329 ± 12 MPa, 1621 ± 16 MPa and 11.7 ± 0.5%, respectively. The strengthening contributions to the high yield strength of the sample come from nano-lamella structure, grain boundaries, dislocations and nano-precipitates. In addition, wear behavior at room temperature and elevated temperatures of the SLM-ed EHEA sample have also been studied. The tribological property is substantially enhanced with increasing temperature from room temperature to 700 °C due to the transformation in wear mechanism from adhesive wear to oxidative wear. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Eutectic high entropy alloy; Microstructure; Selective laser melting; Tensile behavior; Wear behavior","Adhesives; Aluminum alloys; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Crystal structure; Ductility; Entropy; Grain boundaries; High strength alloys; High-entropy alloys; Iron alloys; Melting; Selective laser melting; Tensile strength; Wear of materials; Yield stress; Body-centred cubic; Eutectic high entropy alloy; High entropy alloys; High-strength; Lamellae structures; Nanoprecipitate; Selective laser melting; Single phasis; Tensile behaviors; Wear behaviors; Eutectics","","","","","","","Yeh J.-W., Chen S.-K., Lin S.-J., Gan J.-Y., Chin T.-S., Shun T.-T., Tsau C.-H., Chang S.-Y., Nanostructured high-entropy alloys with multiple principal elements: novel alloy design concepts and outcomes, Adv.

Biomass is not only desirable for biofuel production but could also have a strong market, if high-ash biomass is acceptable, for biocomposites. In this work, natural fibers (switchgrass and corn stover) were used to reinforce polylactic acid (PLA) to produce biocomposites. Natural fibers were pretreated to obtain fibers that contain different percentages of ash. The mechanical properties (such as Young's modulus, tensile strength, failure strain, storage modulus) of corn stover/PLA composites remained largely unaffected by the ash concentration of the biomass fibers, despite the large range of ash contents (2.2–11.9 wt%). However, the tensile strengths of switchgrass/PLA composites were slightly negatively affected by the ash concentration of the switchgrass fibers (0.7–2.1 wt%). Both the switchgrass/PLA and the corn stover/PLA composites exhibited a high-enough tensile strength (49–57 MPa) and suitable complex viscosity (2.0−7.0 kPa·s at the frequency of 3.2 rad/s). They are expected to be 3D-printable through an extrusion-based additive manufacturing process. © 2022","Ash; Biocomposite; Mechanical property; Natural fiber; Polymer PLA","","","","","","DOE Public Access Plan; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (2.5.6.105); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Advanced Manufacturing Office, AMO, (35714); Advanced Manufacturing Office, AMO; Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE; UT-Battelle, (DE-AC05-00OR22725); UT-Battelle","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge support from the US Department of Energy (DOE) FY 2021 BETO Project under Contract 2.5.6.105 with UT-Battelle LLC, and the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Advanced Manufacturing Office under CPS Agreement 35714.

Existing techniques for preventing counterfeiting are based on external modification of the manufacturing process which incurs extra cost, and limits their use in everyday applications. In our work, we take advantage of the inherent characteristics of the machine configuration (machine and process parameters) to identify whether a given part is manufactured by a certain machine or class of machines. Each machine configuration has a unique coordinate error distribution which is indicative of its precision and bias. The overarching idea is to differentiate between error distributions of two machine configurations in order to determine whether the positional errors in a given part come from the same distribution as that of the machine configuration. To be able to differentiate between two machine configurations robustly, we propose a novel topological transformation technique based on the principle of Voronoi tessellation that exaggerates the difference between their error distributions. We present a methodology for authentication of machined parts and validate it numerically and experimentally through the example of additive manufacturing. This research work also offers various opportunities of further exploration in terms of part design, algorithm of SplitCode, imaging and post processing methods and statistical variations. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Additive manufacturing; Authentication; Coordinate error distributions; Counterfeiting; Topology change; Voronoi tessellation","3D printers; Additives; Computational geometry; Errors; Losses; Topology; Coordinate error distribution; Counterfeiting; Economic loss; Error distributions; Manufacturing IS; Small business; Topology changes; Two machines; Voronoi; Voronoi tessellations; Authentication","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2048182)","This work was partially supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), USA Award #2048182 (Engineering Design and Systems Engineering Program).

With such a composition transition, position with the weakest mechanical properties could be clearly and easily located in the composition gradient path, allowing the issue to be fully exposed. During the fabrication, cracks were found near the position with IN625 of 20 wt%. By analyzing the fracture morphology and crack location, they were judged as liquation cracks, which belong to hot cracks. The segregation and aggregation of carbides at the grain boundary formed the low-melting-temperature eutectic phase, which is liquefied into the liquid film by the heating of subsequent layers and is then pulled apart by residual stress. According to the experimental results and the calculations of phase diagrams, the cracks always appeared near the position with IN625 of 20 wt%, where the FGM has the highest crack sensitivity. Therefore, it was determined as the weakest position of the FGM and its weakening mechanism could be clarified easier owing to the composition transition, which provides a high possibility to get better mechanical properties if a more targeted optimization method is applied. Process parameter optimization reduces the heat input per unit height to thin dendrites and to alleviate cracking, but there is still a cracking tendency in the weak composition range. The composition gradient path optimization, by removal of the corresponding composition range, can solve the cracking issue more thoroughly, and the tensile strength and elongation increased by 39.5 % and 221.7 %, respectively, which greatly improved the mechanical properties of the FGM. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Composition gradient path optimization;

Within this vast array of responsive soft materials, hydrogels receive considerable attention due to their fascinating properties, including biodegradable, self-healing, stimuli-responsive, and large volume transformation. Konjac glucomannan (KGM) is an edible polysaccharide that forms a pH-responsive, self-healing hydrogel when crosslinked with borax, and it is the focus of this study. A novel KGM-Borax ink for three-dimensional (3D) printing of free-form structures and soft robots at room temperature is presented. A complete process from ink preparation to the fabrication of a completely cross-linked part is demonstrated. Print setting parameters, rheological properties of the ink and crosslinked gels were characterized. Print quality was found to be consistent across a wide range of print settings. The minimum line width achieved is 650 μm. Tensile testing was carried out to validate the self-healing capability of the KGM-Borax gel. Results show that KGM-Borax has a high self-healing efficiency of 98%. Self-healing underwater was also demonstrated, a rarity for crosslinked gels. The means to form complex structures via 3D printing, reacting to environmental stimuli and the resilience against damage, make this new KGM-Borax gel a promising candidate for the fabrication of the next generation of soft robots.  © 2022 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","3D printing; konjac glucomannan; polysaccharide gel; self-healing","3D printers; Crosslinking; Hydrogels; Robots; Self-healing materials; Sodium borate; Tensile testing; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Cross-linked gels; Glucomannan gels; Konjac glucomannan; Polysaccharide gel; Self-healing; Soft robot; Softer materials; Stimuli-responsive; Gels","","","","","Royal Academy of Engineering, RAENG; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/M020460/1, EP/L015293/1); University of Bristol, (EP/S026096/1, EP/R02961X/1)","This work was supported by the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Future Autonomous and Robotic Systems (FARSCOPE, grant EP/L015293/1) at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory where D.G. is a PhD student.

Researchers have proposed educational interventions to train students in DfAM; however, few measures with sufficient validity evidence have been proposed to assess the effects of these educational interventions on student designers’ learning. In this paper, we present the development of a ten-item DfAM self-efficacy scale spanning the opportunistic and restrictive DfAM domains, as they relate to conceptual design (i.e., preliminary concept generation and selection). We tested the criterion-related validity of the scale by comparing students’ self-efficacy to their prior AM and DfAM experience. Additionally, we tested the construct validity of the scale through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Students’ responses to the scale positively correlated with their prior experience in AM and DfAM, thereby lending criterion-related validity. Additionally, factor analyses reveal that students’ responses are composed of two dimensions: (1) opportunistic DfAM and (2) restrictive DfAM, reflecting the categorization observed in the literature. This finding lends construct validity evidence and demonstrates that the scale captures students’ self-efficacies in the two DfAM domains with sufficient separation. This work supports the use of the DfAM self-efficacy scale for assessing the effects of DfAM education on students’ DfAM learning in conceptual design. Moreover, the DfAM self-efficacy scale can support future research attempting to enhance the effectiveness of AM and DfAM educational interventions by measuring their effects on students’ self-perceived abilities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Assessment; Design education; Design for additive manufacturing; Self-efficacy","Additives; Conceptual design; Factor analysis; Students; Additive manufacturing process; Assessment; Construct validity; Design Education; Design for additive manufacturing; Educational intervention; Factors analysis; Self efficacy; Student response; Validity evidence; 3D printers","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1712234)","This research was funded by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1712234.

Although 18Ni-300 maraging steel has been extensively employed in this process, a significant trade-off has always existed between strength and ductility when using traditional solution and ageing heat treatments. This study addresses this problem by introducing a heat treatment combination that includes hot isostatic pressing (HIP) before the conventional ageing treatment. The experimental results demonstrated an enhancement of the relative density from 99.6% in the as-built conditions to 99.96% after HIP, although a small number of residual gas pores remained. The subsequent ageing treatment after HIP had a negligible effect on the reopening of these closed defects. Microstructure observations revealed that a fully martensitic structure can be obtained after HIP, and austenite reversion was less sensitive with the HIP + ageing treatment (HAT) compared to direct ageing treatment (DAT). Grain growth and alloying homogenisation also occurred during HIP. Massive nanoscale precipitations were formed both after DAT and HAT; quantitative analysis based on TEM observation indicated that the size of these precipitates was larger after subjecting to HAT. The room-temperature ultimate tensile strength and elongation to failure after HAT were approximately 6% and 100% higher than DAT, confirming the simultaneous enhancement of the strength and ductility after HAT. The findings of the present study offer insights into heat treatment approaches that can overcome the strength-ductility trade-off of LPBF-manufactured 18Ni-300 maraging steel, while also providing an alternative strategy for obtaining the simultaneous improvement of strength and ductility through heat treatments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Hot isostatic pressing; Laser powder bed fusion; Maraging steel; Mechanical behaviour; Strengthening mechanism","Ductility; Economic and social effects; High strength alloys; High strength steel; Maraging steel; Powder metals; Sintering; Tensile strength; Ageing treatments; Direct aging; Hot-isostatic pressings; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Mechanical behavior; Powder bed; Strength and ductilities; Strengthening mechanisms; Trade off; Hot isostatic pressing","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51805052, 51975073); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Scholarship Council, CSC","This paper was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No: 51975073 , 51805052 ).

The average daily waiting time should meet a prespecified quality standard. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor such waiting times at regular intervals to maintain and improve the service quality. Similar problems arise in many time-between-event monitoring problems. This paper suggests two improved nonparametric Lepage schemes supplemented with runs rules, i.e., the 2-of-3 runs rules Lepage and the synthetic Lepage schemes. We show the real-life usage of the suggested schemes in monitoring the average daily customer waiting time of a service centre in Australia. The distribution-free nature of the suggested schemes allows broader applicability irrespective of the underlying process density. Moreover, the proposed schemes can jointly monitor the process location and scale parameters. We demonstrate the superiority of the suggested runs rules schemes to those without runs rules, i.e., the Shewhart-Lepage (SL) scheme through computer-intensive Monte-Carlo simulation. In general, we recommend the 2-of-3 runs rules Lepage scheme due to its efficiency and simplicity. © 2022","Average waiting time; Monte-Carlo; Runs rules; Service quality; Shewhart-Lepage; Synthetic scheme","Intelligent systems; Quality of service; Average waiting-time; Monte-carlo; Nonparametrics; Runs rules; Service center; Service Quality; Shewhart; Shewhart-lepage; Synthetic scheme; Monte Carlo methods","","","","","Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE, (FRGS/1/ 2019/STG06/UTAR/02/2); Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE","The research was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE) Malaysia through Fundamental Research Grant Scheme project FRGS/1/ 2019/STG06/UTAR/02/2 .

We detail the design and build of the motion system, print head (including heaters, extrusion system and high voltage power supply) and safety systems, and explain how these are integrated via a central control unit to provide pre-programmed dynamic control over printing variables allowing the fabrication of a range of advanced material designs with applications in the fields of tissue engineering, regenerative medicine and beyond. We discuss the various approaches which may be used for each system within a custom MEW printer, providing an insight into how it may be designed depending on the specific requirements of the end user. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of this printer by producing tissue engineering scaffolds with various architectures.

However, the surface geometric accuracy of the CMT- fabricated sample is inferior, especially for the deposition of titanium alloy. The focus of this study was to analyze the metal transfer behavior during CMT-WAAM of titanium alloys by a high-speed camera. The metal transfer and molten pool behaviors during the single-layer and multi-layer deposition in both CMT and CMT + P modes were compared to optimize the characteristic process parameters. The results showed that the hybrid metal transfer mode, including the short-circuit transition and the globular transition, occurred in the CMT + P mode. The effect of Ip1 on the droplet diameter was more significant than that of tp1. Under these two modes, the size and spread ability of the molten pool increased with the increase of Iboost, tp1 and Ip1. While in the CMT + P mode, Ip1 did not yield a significant influence compared with tp1. Simultaneously, noticeable oxide skin was observed on the surface of the flowing molten pool when Iboost reached 350 A in the CMT mode. Compared with the CMT mode, new spatter types were generated by arc force and droplet free-fall motion in the CMT + P mode. Ultimately, the maximum effective rate of 70.4 % was obtained in the CMT + P mode when the parameters were selected as Ip1 = 400 A and tp1 = 4 ms. © 2022","Bead morphology; CMT-WAAM; Metal transfer mode;

However, finding an optimal set of printing parameters for these thermoset composites during extrusion requires tedious experimentation as composite ink properties can vary significantly with respect to environmental parameters such as temperature and relative humidity. Addressing this challenge, this study presents a novel optimization framework that utilizes computer vision and deep learning (DL) to optimize the calibration and printing processes of thermoset composite AM. Unlike traditional DL models where printing parameters are determined prior to printing, our proposed framework dynamically and autonomously adjusts the printing parameters during extrusion. A novel DL integrated extrusion AM system is developed to determine the optimal printing parameters including print speed, road width, and layer height for a given composite ink. This closed loop system is consisted of a computer communicating with an extrusion AM system, a camera to perform in-situ imaging and several high accuracy convolution neural networks (CNNs) selecting the ideal process parameters for composite AM. The results show that our proposed process optimization framework was able to autonomously determine these parameters for a carbon fiber-composite ink. Consequently, specimens with complex geometries could be fabricated without visible defects and with maximum fiber alignment and thus enhancing the mechanical performance of the specimen's composite material. Moreover, our proposed framework minimizes a labor-intensive procedure required to additively manufacture thermoset composites by optimizing the extrusion process without any user intervention. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Composite 3D printing; Computer vision; Deep learning; Extrusion","Additives; Carbon fibers; Closed loop systems; Computer vision; Deep learning; Extrusion; Neural networks; Optimization; Thermosets; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Composite 3d printing; Composite additives; Deep learning; High-performance thermosets; Optimal sets; Optimisations; Optimization framework; Thermoset composites; 3D printers","","","","","Universal Technology Corporation, (AWD-005538); Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL","The authors greatly appreciate the contributions of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Summer Faculty Program and the Universal Technology Corporation funds under the Project Number AWD-005538 .

Two infrared lasers were combined to exploit C2H2 and CH4 absorption lines centered at 6539.45 cm−1 and 6057.09 cm−1, respectively. Scanned-WMS with the second-harmonic detection (WMS-2f) and a compact astigmatic multipass gas cell (36-m path length in a 0.3 L volume) were employed to improve detection sensitivity. Simultaneous dual-gas detection was realized by modulating each laser at a different frequency (5 kHz for 1529 nm and 13 kHz for 1650 nm) and software lock-in amplifiers were used to obtain the corresponding WMS-2f signals from a single photodetector. The Allan deviation analysis was performed to assess the long-term stability and minimum detection limit (MDL) of the sensor system. The MDL of 0.92 ppm for CH4 and 0.64 ppm for C2H2 was achieved at 0.02-s integration time, which can be further improved to 55 ppb for CH4 and 10 ppb for C2H2 at an optimum integration time of 10-s and 15-s, respectively. Such a dual-gas sensor has a promising potential for detecting dissolved gases (CH4 and C2H2) in transformer oil for fault diagnosis due to its high sensitivity, hardware simplicity, and fast temporal resolution. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Acetylene; Frequency-division multiplexing; Methane; Wavelength modulation spectroscopy","Absorption spectroscopy; Gas absorption; Gas detectors; Gases; Lighting; Methane; Modulation; Molecular spectroscopy; Oil filled transformers; Absorption lines; CH 4; Frequency division; Frequency-division- multiplexing; Infrared-laser; Laser absorption spectroscopy; Minimum detection limits; Scanned wavelengths; Simultaneous detection; Wavelength modulation spectroscopy; Acetylene","","","","","Innovation and Technology Commission, ITC; Guangdong Science and Technology Department, GDSTC, (2020A0505090010, 2020A0505140001); Guangdong Science and Technology Department, GDSTC; Innovation and Technology Fund, ITF, (GHP/123/19GD, MHP/049/19); Innovation and Technology Fund, ITF","This work is supported by Guangdong Science and Technology Department ( 2020A0505090010 , 2020A0505140001 ), China and the Innovation and Technology Fund ( GHP/123/19GD , MHP/049/19 ) from the Innovation and Technology Commission, Hong Kong SAR, China.","Ma G.-M., Zhao S.-J., Jiang J., Song H.-T., Li C.-R., Luo Y.-T., Et al., Tracing acetylene dissolved in transformer oil by tunable diode laser absorption spectrum, Sci.

This paper discusses the uncertainty associated with tensile test results coupons manufactured using additive manufacturing (also known as 3D printer). The tensile specimens are made from a commercial acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) polymer (P430) polymer materials and the uncertainty estimation was obtained by using the Guide of Uncertainty Measurement approach. Although neither tensile testing nor error propagation are novel, there is little research documenting the error propagation of tensile tests using the Guide of uncertainty measurement approach. The tensile coupons were built on flat at different build orientations of 0°, 22.5°, 45°, 67.5°, and 90° and were then subjected to mechanical testing. The uncertainty propagation associated with the measuring instruments was calculated. The uncertainty in cross-section area, ultimate tensile strength, yield strength and the Young's modulus was then estimated. It was found that the cross-sectional area has a higher uncertainty due to inaccuracies measurement for the original width and thickness. This observation was recorded for the additively manufactured part built at 0° build orientation. It can be concluded that the variation and inaccuracies has contributed to a greater uncertainty in the ultimate tensile strength, yield strength and the Young's modulus results. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Errors; Percentage errors; Standard deviation; Tensile test; Uncertainty propagation","3D printers; ABS resins; Additives; Elastic moduli; Error analysis; Styrene; Tensile strength; Uncertainty analysis; Yield stress; Build orientation; Error propagation; Percentage error; Standard deviation; Tensile test; Ultimate tensile strength; Uncertainty; Uncertainty measurements; Uncertainty propagation; Young modulus; Tensile testing","","","","","Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Laboratories; Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Carleton University; Carleton University; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the technical support and training provided by Mr. Steve Truttmann, the supervisor of the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Laboratories at Carleton University.

It is associated with lost dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra, a process that is not yet fully understood. To understand this deleterious disorder, there is an immense need to develop efficient in vitro three-dimensional (3D) models that can recapitulate complex organs such as the brain. However, due to the complexity of neurons, selecting suitable biomaterials to accommodate them is challenging. Here, we report on the fabrication of functional DA neuronal 3D models using ultrashort self-assembling tetrapeptide scaffolds. Our peptide-based models demonstrate biocompatibility both for primary mouse embryonic DA neurons and for human DA neurons derived from human embryonic stem cells. DA neurons encapsulated in these scaffolds responded to 6-hydroxydopamine, a neurotoxin that selectively induces loss of DA neurons. Using multi-electrode arrays, we recorded spontaneous activity in DA neurons encapsulated within these 3D peptide scaffolds for more than 1 month without decrease of signal intensity. Additionally, vascularization of our 3D models in a co-culture with endothelial cells greatly promoted neurite outgrowth, leading to denser network formation. This increase of neuronal networks through vascularization was observed for both primary mouse DA and cortical neurons. Furthermore, we present a 3D bioprinted model of DA neurons inspired by the mouse brain and created with an extrusion-based 3D robotic bioprinting system that was developed during previous studies and is optimized with time-dependent pulsing by microfluidic pumps. We employed a hybrid fabrication strategy that relies on an external mold of the mouse brain construct that complements the shape and size of the desired bioprinted model to offer better support during printing. We hope that our 3D model provides a platform for studies of the pathogenesis of PD and other neurodegenerative disorders that may lead to better understanding and more efficient treatment strategies. © 2022 The Author(s).

The effect of brazing temperature and time on microstructure and mechanical property of structured IN718 joints is investigated. The results reveal that the joint consists of ISZ, ASZ, and DAZ, with ISZ consisting of γ solid solution; ASZ consisting of Cr2B, Ni3B Ni3Si, and Ni6Si2B and the intermetallic compounds are concentrated in the crest and trough; DAZ has a large amount of (Cr, Nb, Mo)-rich borides. The different degrees of enrichment of the elements affect the changes of the microstructure and morphology in DAZ. With the increase in brazing temperature, the ASZ gradually becomes smaller, and more Cr2B is observed. At 1110 °C, the reduced isothermal solidification rate leads to the re-formation of intermetallic compounds in the narrower gap zone. With the increase in holding time, the intermetallic compounds gradually decrease to disappear, but in the narrower gap zone, Kirkendall holes appeared. The highest shear strength of the joint is 676.5 MPa along the groove direction and 624.4 MPa in the vertical groove structure direction at 1080 °C/40 min, 27.5 to 38.1% improvement in strength compared with flat joints. The fracture mechanism is mixed with brittle and ductile fracture. © 2022, ASM International.","brazing; Inconel 718; mechanical properties; microstructure; SLM","Brazing; Chromium compounds; Ductile fracture; Intermetallics; Morphology; Nickel compounds; Silicon; Silicon compounds; Brazing temperature; Brazing time; Inconel-718; Intermetallics compounds; Microstructure and properties; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Narrow gap; Selective laser melting; SLM; Vacuum brazed joints; Microstructure","","","","","Aid for Xinjiang Science and Technology Project, (2019E0235); Karamay Science and Technology Major Project, (2018ZD002B); Shanghai Local Colleges and Universities Capacity Building Special Plan Project, (19030501300); Shanghai Sailing Program, (19YF1418100); Royal Society, (IEC\NSFC\181278); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52075317); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM, (17JC1400600, 17JC1400601, 19511106400, 19511106402); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFB1301600)","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52075317), the Royal Society through International Exchanges 2018 Cost Share (China) scheme (IEC\NSFC\181278), Shanghai Sailing Program (19YF1418100), Shanghai Science and Technology Committee Innovation Grant (17JC1400600, 17JC1400601, 19511106400, 19511106402), Karamay Science and Technology Major Project (2018ZD002B), Aid for Xinjiang Science and Technology Project (2019E0235), Shanghai Local Colleges and Universities Capacity Building Special Plan Project (19030501300), and National Key R & D Program of China (2017YFB1301600).

Methods: The intermediary cardanol epoxy (CNE) was synthesized through cardanol epoxidation, followed by synthesis of cardanol methacrylate through methacrylic acid solvent-free esterification. Zymographic analysis was performed to evaluate the substances’ ability to inhibit gelatinolytic enzymes. Collagen crosslinkers were added into adhesives systems according to the following groups: Ybond Universal® (Control), Ybond® + 2 % proanthocyanidin (PAC), Ybond® + 2 % unsaturated cardanol (Cardanol) and Ybond® + 2 % cardanol methacrylate (CNMA). Degree of conversion (DC) of the adhesives was assessed by FT-IR. Disk-shaped specimens were prepared for water sorption (WS) and solubility (SL) tests. Human third molars were sectioned to expose medium dentin and restored according to the different adhesives used (n = 5). Then, the specimens were cut into 1 mm2 sticks to evaluate, after 24 h and 6-month aging, microtensile bond strength (µTBS) and nanoleakage by scanning electron microscopy. Data were analysed with ANOVA and Tukey's post-test (α = 0.05). Results: CNMA and PAC completely inhibited all forms of gelatinolytic enzymes. Cardanol achieved a significantly lowest DC, while the other groups did not differ from each other (p > 0.05). PAC achieved significantly higher water sorption, while CNMA solubility was significantly lower when compared to the other adhesives (p < 0.05). PAC provided a statistically higher 24 h and 6-month aging bond strength. Intermediary similar µTBS were presented by control and CNMA (p = 0.108). All adhesives applied attained significantly reduced bond strength after aging (p < 0.05). Interfaces created using CNMA were almost devoid of silver deposits initially, however all groups showed large amounts of silver deposits on resin-dentin interface subjected to water aging. Significance: Although CNMA was effective in inhibiting gelatinolytic enzymes, when incorporated into a universal adhesive it could not promote less degradation of the adhesive interface after water aging. Since it is a hydrophobic monomer, CNMA did not interact well with dentin collagen, however it reduced the solubility of the adhesive system besides not interfering in its polymerization. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Cardanol;

The fluid with a slip-boundary has a variety of uses in current technology, including the polishing of prosthetic heart valves and the interior heart cavities. The fluid motion is governed by connected nonlinear PDE's which are converted into convenient equations by applying finite-difference scheme with primitive transformation and Gaussian elimination technique. The numerical solutions of connected dimensionalized equations are obtained in the form of fluid velocity, temperature and magnetic profiles which are used to examined oscillating skin-friction, oscillating heat transfer and current-density for various emerging dimensionless parameters, slip number SL, Prandtl number Pr, porous number ωand some other fixed parameters. The FORTRAN software is used for numerical results and displayed these results on Tech Plot. The novelty of the current work is to analyze mixed convective heat transfer analysis with MHD and slip velocity effects for oscillatory flow around a no-conducting horizontal circular cylinder embedded in a porous medium. First, the numerical solutions for steady part are secured and then these results are used in un-steady part, which make nonlinear coupled partial differential equation linear. It is pertinent to mention here that the convective heat transfer is practically associated with oscillatory flow behavior. It is observed that an increase in slip number SLleads to enhance the fluid velocity and temperature field. Transient current density and transient skin friction rate shows maximum magnitude of oscillation at both π/6and π/3stations in the presence of porous material. © 2022 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Technomelt PA 6910 is a semicrystalline polymer with a sub-ambient glass transition temperature, intermediate melting temperature, and low recrystallization temperature. This paper aims to study the effect of glass fibers and toolpath on mechanical properties, warpage, and dimensional accuracy of prints. Glass fibers improved the yield strength of 0° raster angle bars, but reduced the strength of 90° raster angle samples. The reduced weld strength was more significant in samples cut from single road width boxes than multilayer (≈3.2 mm thick) specimens due to fast cooling of thin parts. Glass fibers prevented warpage and excessive spread of initial layers of boxes. Toolpath affected tensile properties for Technomelt PA 6910, in which longer toolpaths resulted in higher warpage and decreased tensile strength of parts due to longer layer times, but did not affect tensile properties for Loctite 3D 6910. While Technomelt PA 6910 exhibits isotropic tensile properties, the addition of glass fibers resulted in anisotropic properties of Loctite 3D 6910 bars, which was more significant in single road (≈0.4 mm thick) parts. Multilayer Loctite 3D 6910 structures are stronger, which makes this material more appropriate for larger scale applications in which there is a high thermal mass and slumping is a significant printing challenge. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Glass fibers; Material extrusion; Tool path; Warpage","3D printers; Additives; Bond strength (materials); Extrusion; Glass fibers; Glass transition; Multilayers; Roads and streets; Dimensional accuracy; Filled composites; Glass fiber reinforcement; Glass-fibers; Hotmelt adhesive (HMAs); Loctite; Material extrusion; Thermally driven; Toolpaths; Warpages; Tensile strength","","","","","Henkel Corporation; Tim Welters of Henkel Corporation; National Science Foundation, NSF, (CMMI-1853480)","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge financial support from the National Science Foundation (CMMI-1853480).

Most previous proposals for reaching 1I/’Oumuamua using near-term technologies are based on the Solar Oberth Manoeuvre (SOM), as trajectories without the SOM are generally significantly inferior in terms of lower mission duration and higher total velocity requirement. While the SOM allows huge velocity gains, it is also technically challenging and thereby increases programmatic and mission-related risks. In this paper, we identify an alternative route to the interstellar object 1I/’Oumuamua, based on a launch in 2028, which does not require a SOM but has a similar performance as missions with a SOM. It instead employs a Jupiter Oberth Manoeuvre (JOM) with a total time of flight of around 26 years or so. The efficacy of this trajectory is a result of it significantly reducing the ΔV to Jupiter by exploiting the VEEGA sequence. The total ΔV of the trajectory is 15.8 kms−1 and the corresponding payload mass is 115 kg for a SLS Block 1B or 241 kg for a Block 2. A further advantage of the JOM is that the arrival speed relative to 1I/’Oumuamua is approximately 18 kms−1, much lower than the equivalent for the SOM of around 30 kms−1. © 2022 IAA","Interstellar object; Mission; Trajectory; VEEGA; ’Oumuamua","Space flight; Alternative routes; In-situ observations; Interstellar object; Jupiters; Mission; Mission duration; Programmatics; Related risk; VEEGA; ’oumuamua; Trajectories","","","","","","","Bannister M.T., Bhandare A., Dybczynski P.A., Fitzsimmons A., Guilbert-Lepoutre A., Jedicke R., Knight M.M., Meech K.J., McNeill A., Pfalzner S., Et al., Nature Astron., 3, pp. 594-602, (2019); Flekkoy E.G., Luu J., Toussaint R., Astrophys.

However, the process is complex with many parameters adjustable for process control, which determine the thermal behaviour and thus the final structure and properties of the deposited components. In this study, a three-dimensional steady-state finite element model with two independent circular surface heat sources was developed, validated, and used to analyse the thermal behaviour in hybrid PTA-laser AM of Ti-6Al-4V. Artificial conductivity in three orthogonal directions was applied in the melt pool to compensate for the melt pool convection effect. The predicted melt pool geometry, heat-affected zone and thermal cycles had good agreement with the corresponding experimental data. This model has advantages over the widely used volumetric heat source model, since it is more representative of the energy sources used, giving accurate thermal prediction for a wide range of process parameters. As the heat source parameters in this model are directly linked to the actual arc/laser size, it enables to capture heat source size effect on the hybrid process. In addition, it is easier to calibrate compared to the model with volumetric heat sources due to the fewer empirical parameters involved. It was found that in the investigated ranges of all the parameters, the melt pool geometry is more sensitive to laser power and travel speed compared to arc-laser separation distance and laser beam size. The full-field distributions of the cooling rate and temperature gradient in the hybrid process were obtained and the roles that different process parameters played on them were also studied, which provided useful thermal information for metallurgical analysis. © 2022 The Author(s)","Hybrid plasma arc-laser additive manufacturing; Melt pool geometry; Orthotropic artificial conductivity; Steady-state finite element model; Thermal variables","3D printers; Additives; Deposition rates; Finite element method; Hard facing; Heat affected zone; Lakes; Laser beams; Plasma welding; Finite element modelling (FEM); Hybrid plasma; Hybrid plasma arc-laser additive manufacturing; Laser additive manufacturing; Melt pool; Melt pool geometry; Orthotropic artificial conductivity; Plasma arc; Steady state; Steady-state finite element model; Thermal variables; Geometry","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/R027218/1); Cranfield University; China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201706450041)","Chong Wang would like to acknowledge China Scholarship Council (No. 201706450041 ) and Welding Engineering and Laser Processing Centre (WELPC) of Cranfield University for funding his research studies.

However, its weak and easily tuned mechanical properties are still difficult to precisely evaluate, due to the lack of an effective stretching method. In this paper, we propose a force-control-based cyclic loading method for rapidly evaluating the elastic modulus: the E of the microfibers with different GelMA concentrations. A two-tube manipulation system is used to stretch microfiber with a non-destructive process. Based on the model reference adaptive control strategy, the stress response can be fitted into a sinusoidal wave when a small sinusoidal strain is automatically applied onto the microfiber. Afterwards, the maximum tensile stress and tensile stain is obtained to determine the E. Moreover, different stress amplitudes and frequencies are applied to form different stress-strain loops with almost same E. Compared with a frequently-used constant force loading method, the proposed method shows an obvious advantage in measurement accuracy, especially for low-concentration GelMA microfiber. Furthermore, the reasonableness of the measured E for different GelMA concentrations is confirmed by 3D cell culture experiments, and the results show the proposed method has great application potential to investigate the interaction between cell and fibrous bioink substrate. © 2022 by the authors.","cyclic loading; elastic modulus; force control; GelMA microfiber; stress-strain loop","Cell culture; Displacement control; Elastic moduli; Gelation; Loads (forces); Microfibers; Strain; Bioprinting; Cyclic loading; Destructive process; Gelation methacrylate microfiber; Loading methods; Manipulation system; Micro-fiber; Non destructive; Stress-strain loops; Stretching force; Force control","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62173043); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 62173043.","Klotz B.J., Gawlitta D., Rosenberg A.J.W.P., Malda J., Melchels F.P.W., Gelatin-methacryloyl hydrogels: Towards biofabrication-based tissue repair, Trends Biotechnol, 34, pp. 394-407, (2016); Nichol J.W., Koshy S.T., Bae H., Hwang C.M., Yamanlar S., Khademhosseini A., Cell-laden microengineered gelatin methacrylate hydrogels, Biomaterials, 31, pp. 5536-5544, (2010); Wei Z., Sun T., Shimoda S., Chen Z., Chen X., Wang H., Huang Q., Fukuda T., Shi Q., Bio-inspired engineering of a perfusion culture platform for guided three-dimensional nerve cell growth and differentiation, Lab Chip, 22, pp. 1006-1017, (2022); Shao L., Gao Q., Zhao H., Xie C., Fu J., Liu Z., Xiang M., He Y., Fiber-Based Mini Tissue with Morphology-Controllable GelMA Microfibers, Small, 14, (2018); Colosi C., Shin S.R., Manoharan V., Massa S., Costantini M., Barbetta A., Dokmeci M.R., Dentini M., Khademhosseini A., Microfluidic bioprinting of heterogeneous 3D tissue constructs using low-viscosity bioink, Adv.

During the rebuilding of the Tisza bridge on the M4 motorway, the contractor discovered that the plates used to build the steel superstructure had developed corrosion damage during several years of storage. Plates with a tolerable level of corrosion were intended to be used, but the question was how the increased surface roughness will affect the fatigue life of the plates and the welded steel fabrications made from the plates. As part of this test, fatigue specimens were measured from the material to be used for the bridge and welded with two different geometries with the help of a structured light 3D scanner (SLS scanner). This paper discusses the measurement and inspection of these steel specimens of a highway bridge, before and after the fatigue test of the parts. From the acquired data we examined defects on the surface of the parts, physical deformations by comparing measured data to a CAD model and calculated the amount of material which was lost during stress testing. © 2022, Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

Therefore, new methods to influence the tribology represent an important research topic. In this work, the application of a process-integrated lubrication in a deep-drawing process is investigated. Most promising geometries of the lubrication channels and outlet openings are first identified by means of numerical simulation at the example of a demonstrator process. Cylindrical test specimens with the specified channel geometries are additively manufactured and installed in a strip drawing test stand. Additive manufacturing enables the possibility of manufacturing complex channel geometries which cannot be manufactured by conventional methods. A hydraulic metering device for conveying lubricant is connected to the cylindrical test specimens. Thus, hydraulically lubricated strip drawing tests are performed. The tests are evaluated according to the force curves and the fluid mechanical buildup of pressure cushion. The performance of process-integrated lubrication is thus analyzed and evaluated. By means of a coupled forming and SPH simulation, the lubrication channels could be optimally designed. From the practical tests, it could be achieved that the drawing force decreases up to 27% with pressure cushion build up. In this research, a hydraulic lubrication in the area of highest contact normal stresses is the most optimal process parameter regarding friction reduction. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing (AM); deep-drawing; design for additive manufacturing (DfAM); functional integration; laser powder bed fusion (LPBF); lubrication","","","","","","","","Birkert A., Haage S., Straub M., Umformtechnische Herstellung Komplexer Karosserieteile, (2013); Behrens B.-A., Hubner S., Muller P., Besserer H.-B., Gerstein G., Koch S., Rosenbusch D., New Multistage Sheet-Bulk Metal Forming Process Using Oscillating Tools, Metals, 10, (2020); Merklein M., Schmidt M., Tremmel S., Wartzack S., Andreas K., Hafner T., Zhao R., Steiner J., Investigation of Tribological Systems for Dry Deep Drawing by Tailored Surfaces, Dry Met.

However, consumer-grade activity trackers can only capture summary gait metrics, whereas most of the research-grade devices capable of estimating fine-grained gait parameters are too cumbersome for extended-time use in real-life environments. Instrumented footwear may offer a promising alternative tool owing to their good accuracy and relatively small form factor, but their ability to detect stride-by-stride spatial gait parameters in free-living conditions has not been well explored to date. This work describes machine learning (ML) inference models for an insole system capable of accurately estimating stride time (ST), length (SL), and velocity (SV) in real-life environments. Functional validity was assessed through unstructured tests including straight-line walking, curve walking, and turns. Ecological validity was examined in free-living conditions. The ML models demonstrated better accuracy than conventional data processing methods (mean absolute errors in unstructured conditions were 3.55% for SL and 3.59% for SV). Real-life gait parameters estimated with the ML models showed stronger associations with a standardized walking test compared with the same parameters obtained with conventional methods. These results indicate proof-of-concept feasibility of using instrumented insoles and ML inference models for free-living spatiotemporal gait analysis.  © 2016 IEEE.","ambulatory gait analysis; instrumented footwear; machine learning inference models; Wearable technology","Biological systems; Data handling; Diagnosis; Ecology; Machine learning; Parameter estimation; Wearable sensors; Ambulatory gait analyse; Biological system modeling; Footwear; Free livings; Inference models; Instrumented footwear; Legged locomotion; Machine learning inference model; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Gait analysis","","","","","NJ DOH, (CAUT22ACP004); Muscular Dystrophy Association, MDA, (MDA629259); Cure SMA, CSMA, (PT18-2886)","This work was supported in part by the Muscular Dystrophy Association under Grant MDA629259, in part by Cure SMA under Grant PT18-2886, and in part by NJ DOH under Grant CAUT22ACP004.","Shema-Shiratzky S., Et al., Deterioration of specific aspects of gait during the instrumented 6-min walk test among people with multiple sclerosis, J.

Although magnesium alloys have been considered potential materials for such a treatment, their application is limited by their fast degradation. Adding bioceramic particles into magnesium to form Mg-matrix composites is a promising strategy to adjust their biodegradation rates and to improve their mechanical properties and cytocompatibility further. Here, we developed an extrusion-based additive manufacturing technique to fabricate biodegradable Mg-Zn/bioceramic composite scaffolds ex-situ. Inks carrying a Mg-Zn powder and 5, 10 and 15% β-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) powder particles were investigated regarding the dispersion of β-TCP particles in the inks and viscoelastic properties. Optimally formulated inks were then employed for subsequent 3D printing of porous composite scaffolds. The in vitro biodegradation rate of the scaffolds containing 5% β-TCP decreased to 0.5 mm/y, which falls within the range desired for critical-sized bone substitution. As compared to the monolithic Mg-Zn scaffolds, the elastic moduli and yield strengths of the composite scaffolds were much enhanced, which remained in the range of the cancellous bone properties even after 28 d of in vitro degradation. The Mg-Zn/5TCP and Mg-Zn/10TCP scaffolds also exhibited improved biocompatibility when cultured with preosteoblasts, as compared to Mg-Zn scaffolds. In addition, the ALP activity and mineralization level of the composite scaffolds were much enhanced in the extracts of the composite scaffolds. Taken together, this research marks a great breakthrough in fabricating porous Mg-matrix composite scaffolds that meet several design criteria in terms of appropriate biodegradation rate, mechanical properties, and bioactivity. Statement of significance: The treatment of posttraumatic femoral nonunion with large segmental bone defect is still challenging. In this study, we developed a multi-material extrusion-based additive technique to fabricate porous Mg/bioceramic composite scaffolds for such a treatment. The technique allowed for the fine-tuning of printable inks to optimize the dispersion of micro-sized particles. The relative densities of the struts of the fabricated composite scaffolds reached 99%. The added bioceramic particles (β-TCP) exhibited proper interfacial bonding with the Mg alloy matrix. The porous Mg-based composite possessed desired biodegradability, bone-mimicking mechanical properties throughout the in vitro biodegradation period and improved bioactivity to bone cells. These results demonstrated great prospects of extrusion-based 3D printed porous Mg materials to be developed further as ideal biodegradable bone-substituting materials. © 2022","3D printing; Composite; Magnesium; Material extrusion; Scaffold","Alloys; Biocompatible Materials; Calcium Phosphates; Magnesium; Porosity; Powders; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Tissue Scaffolds; Zinc; Additives; Binary alloys; Biocompatibility; Biodegradability; Biodegradable polymers; Biodegradation; Defects; Dispersions; Extrusion; Magnesium alloys; Scaffolds; Transmission control protocol; Zinc alloys; bioceramics; calcium phosphate; ink; magnesium; molecular scaffold; nanocomposite; zinc; alloy; beta-tricalcium phosphate; biomaterial; magnesium; zinc; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Bioceramic composites; Biodegradation rate; Composite scaffolds; In-vitro; Material extrusion; Mg matrix composites; Segmental bone defect; Tri-calcium phosphates; animal cell; Article; biocompatibility; biodegradability; biological activity; bone mineralization; controlled study; dispersion; in vitro study; mouse; nanofabrication; nonhuman; osteoblast; powder; three dimensional printing; trabecular bone; Young modulus; porosity; three dimensional printing; tissue scaffold; 3D printers","","calcium phosphate, 10103-46-5, 13767-12-9, 14358-97-5, 7758-87-4; magnesium, 7439-95-4; zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6; Alloys, ; beta-tricalcium phosphate, ; Biocompatible Materials, ; Calcium Phosphates, ; Magnesium, ; Powders, ; Zinc, ","","","Department of Process and Energy; Technische Universiteit Delft, TU Delft; China Scholarship Council, CSC","Funding text 1: J.D. thanks the China Scholarship Council (CSC) for financial support.

Cy923 was demonstrated to be an efficient extractant for diclofenac and ibuprofen removal through a facilitated transport mechanism from the aqueous feed phase to the aqueous stripping phase using hydroxide ions as stripping agent. Around 80 % of these pharmaceuticals were extracted in 4 h with 10 % of Cy923 and without extreme alteration in the pH. As for carbamazepine, the stripping conditions were achieved with 10 % of Versatic Acid 10. Variation of concentration of different extractants indicates that a higher transport of diclofenac can be obtained by using 40 % of Cy923. In addition, two commercial polymeric supports (PTFE and PVDF) were compared for the selected operational conditions. Finally, the lifetime of the membrane was extended by soaking the polymeric material in the organic solution under vacuum for 24 h and compared with the membrane prepared with an ultrasound-assisted method. Supported liquid membranes present many advantages and can easily be manipulated and integrated for the treatment of persistent pharmaceutical contaminants from water. © 2022 The Authors","Cyanex 923; Permeability; Pharmaceutical contaminant; Solvent extraction; Stability; Supported liquid membrane","","","","","","Comissionat per a Universitats i Recerca; Marti Franques, (2019PMF-PIPF-81); Rovira i Virgili University Higher Technical School of Chemical Engineering, (MCIN/ AEI /10, RTI2018-096467-B-I00); Generalitat de Catalunya, (2017 SGR 396); Generalitat de Catalunya; Universitat Rovira i Virgili, (2021PFR-URV-87); Universitat Rovira i Virgili; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","Funding text 1: This project has been supported by the grant RTI2018-096467-B-I00 funded by MCIN/ AEI /10.PK039/501100011033 and “ ERDF A way of making Europe”.

When combined with three-dimensional (3D) printing capabilities, complex 3D structures can be produced, from ultrafine fibers in the absence of toxic solvents, making it particularly attractive to fabricate customized scaffolds and implants for medical applications. This research aimed to develop novel less stiff vaginal mesh implants for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) repair, matching the physiological biomechanics of vaginal tissues. The main objectives, to attain that goal, were: Development of a melt electrospinning writing prototype, with additive manufacturing capability, to produce complex structures from micrometer scale fibers, in a direct 3D printing mode; and design and validate new concepts of biodegradable meshes/scaffolds with new geometries, for POP repair. The melt electrospinning writing prototype was built based on different modules. Biodegradable polycaprolactone was used to produce novel implants: Three geometries and two fiber configurations were employed. The commercially available Restorelle® (Coloplast) mesh was used as a benchmark. Printed implants were analyzed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and uniaxial tensile testing. The SEM images showed that the geometry is generally well produced; however, some minor deviations are visible due to charge interactions. The tensile test results indicated that, regardless of the geometry, the samples showed an elastic behavior for smaller displacements; aplastic behavior dominates later stages. In the physiological range of deformation, the novel meshes (80 μm fiber diameter) matched the tissue properties (p > 0.05). The Restorelle mesh was significantly stiffer than vaginal tissue (p < 0.05) and novel meshes. The precision of the various geometrical patterns and fiber diameters produced highlights the success of the designed and built prototype equipment. Results showed that the biodegradable meshes produced are biomechanically more compatible with native tissue than commercial implants.  © 2022 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","biodegradable meshes;

To date, it is the only technique capable of fabricating complex 3D microstructures with finely adjusted geometry on the cell and sub-cell scales. TPP shows a very promising potential in biomedical applications related to high-resolution features, including drug delivery, tissue engineering, microfluidic devices, and so forth. Therefore, it is of high significance to grasp the global scientific achievements in this field. An analysis of publications concerning the applications of TPP in the biomedical field was performed, and the knowledge domain, research hotspots, frontiers, and research directions in this topic were identified according to the research results. Methods: The publications concerning TPP applications in biomedical field were retrieved from WoSCC between 2003 and 2022, Bibliometrics and visual analysis employing CiteSpace software and R-language package Bibliometrix were performed in this study. Results: A total of 415 publications regarding the TPP applications in the biomedical field were retrieved from WoSCC, including 377 articles, and 38 review articles. The studies pertaining to the biomedical applications of TPP began back in 2003 and showed an upward trend constantly. Especially in the recent 5 years, studies of TPP in biomedical field have increased rapidly, with the number of publications from 2017 to 2021 accounting for 52.29% of the total. In terms of output, China was the leading country and Chinese Acad Sci, Tech Inst Phys and Chem was the leading institution. The United States showed the closest cooperation with other countries. ACS applied materials and interfaces was the most prolific journal (n = 13), followed by Biofabrication (n = 11) and Optics express (n = 10). The journals having the top cited papers were Biomaterials, Advanced materials, and Applied physic letters. The most productive author was Aleksandr Ovsianikov (27 articles). Meanwhile, researchers who had close cooperation with other researchers were also prolific authors. “cell behavior”, "" (tissue engineering) scaffolds”, “biomaterials,” and “hydrogel” were the main co-occurrence keywords and “additional manufacturing”, “3D printing,” and “microstructures” were the recent burst keywords. The Keyword clusters, “stem cells,” and “mucosal delivery”, appeared recently. A paper reporting unprecedented high-resolution bull models fabricated by TPP was the most locally cited reference (cited 60 times). “Magnetic actuation” and “additive manufacturing” were recently co-cited reference clusters and an article concerning ultracompact compound lens systems manufactured by TPP was the latest burst reference. Conclusion: The applications of TPP in biomedical field is an interdisciplinary research topic and the development of this field requires the active collaboration of researchers and experts from all relevant disciplines. Bringing up a better utilization of TPP as an additive manufacturing technology to better serve the biomedical development has always been the research focus in this field. Research on stem cells behaviors and mucosal delivery based on microstructures fabricated using TPP were becoming new hotspots. And it can be predicted that using TPP as a sourcing technique to fabricate biomedical-related structures and devices is a new research direction. In addition, the research of functional polymers, such as magnetic-driven polymers, was the frontier topic of TPP biomedical applications.

Creep specimens taken from the as-fabricated plate component at different building heights were tested along the building direction at 650 °C. The results show that under the same heat treatment condition, the recrystallization degree of the specimens taken from the bottom, middle and top of the Inconel 718 plate component differs widely due to the differences in the dislocation density and the texture intensity along the building direction. The bottom specimen exhibited a high recrystallization degree and thus had the longest creep life. Such excellent creep properties of the bottom specimen are mainly attributed to the lower dislocation density and the higher Taylor factor, which cause the lower creep rate, and the lower grain boundary volume fraction, thus reducing the void nucleation sites. The present findings reveal that the impact of the building height-dependent creep performance on the overall service reliability should be considered comprehensively in the subsequent geometrical design of the laser powder bed fusion-fabricated complex structural components. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Creep properties; Laser powder bed fusion; Recrystallization; Superalloy","Buildings; Creep; Fabrication; Grain boundaries; Plates (structural components); Recrystallization (metallurgy); Textures; Building height; Creep properties; Heat treatment conditions; Inconel 718 superalloys; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Plate components; Powder bed; Properties and microstructures; Recrystallisation; Superalloys","","","","","Fundamental research project of Shenyang National Laboratory for Materials Science, (L2019R18); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51771207, 52171128)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC , Grant Nos. 52171128 and 51771207 ), and the Fundamental research project of Shenyang National Laboratory for Materials Science (No. L2019R18 ).","Yeranee K., Rao Y., A review of recent studies on rotating internal cooling for gas turbine blades, Chinese J.

The properties of material like hardness and wear resistance depends upon the microstructure, amount and size of the hard phases present in the alloy. Recently, a new technique called microwave-assisted casting has been introduced. In this casting technique, microwave energy is utilized to manufacture a casting. For this a microwave furnace is required. The process of heating, melting the charge, pouring, solidification and cooling of the casting takes place inside the microwave furnace. In the present work, microwave-assisted casting technique is used for producing castings of ASTM B-23 Tin-based Babbitt alloy. The major focus of the study was to investigate the effect of microwave casting on the wear behaviour of the Babbitt alloy. Accordingly, cast specimens were also produced by conventional casting technique. Both the cast specimens were compared for wear behaviour. The microstructure analysis of the cast specimens of Babbitt alloy was done to study the phases and their distribution. The microstructure indicated the presence of three constituent phases, the solid solution of antimony (Sb) and copper in tin (Sn) is the basic α-phase; the β-phase is cubic crystals of Sn-Sb and η-phase is in the form of needles of Cu6Sn5. XRD analysis was done. It was found that as compared to conventional cast specimens, the amount of β-phase of Sn-Sb was 14.4% and η-phase of Cu6Sn5 was 13.4% more in the microwave cast specimen. On the other hand as compared to conventional cast specimens, the amount of α-phase was 27.8 % less in the microwave cast specimen. Rockwell hardness testing of the cast samples was also carried out. It was observed that hardness of the microwave-assisted cast samples was 1.4 times higher than conventional cast samples. Wear testing of the cast pins was done using Pin-on-Disc tribometer. It was found that wear resistance of microwave assisted cast pin was 3.339 times the wear resistance of conventional cast pin. © 2021, American Foundry Society.","Babbitt; casting; microwave-assisted casting; wear resistance","Antimony compounds; Binary alloys; Hardness; Microstructure; Microwaves; Tin alloys; Wear of materials; Babbitt; Casting techniques; Hard phase; Manufacturing techniques; Microwave furnace; Microwave-assisted; Microwave-assisted casting; Phase present; Property; Wear behaviors; Wear resistance","","","","","","","Khrushchev M.M., Kuritsyna A.D., Analysis of changes in structure of working surface of Babbitt during friction and wear, Trenie Iznos Mash, 5, pp. 76-82, (1950); Massalski T.B., Binary alloy phase diagrams, (1982); Valeeva A.K., Valeev I.S., Fazlyakhmetov R.F., On the wear rate of an Sn11Sb5.5Cu babbitt, J.

The E-BEPU is the systematic risk-informed combined deterministic and probabilistic methodology dedicated to design verification of Nuclear Power Plants. The approach covers applying the best-estimate computer code, realistic input data for initial and boundary conditions with uncertainties, and plant systems availability based on Probabilistic Safety Analysis methods. Furthermore, it extends the scope of the uncertainty analysis to include the availability of safety systems as an additional uncertain item. The approach is characterized by an enhanced Defence-in-Depth; it can detect cliff-edge effects and include risk insights in the deterministic analysis framework. It is an advanced approach to Deterministic Safety Analysis beyond the BEPU approaches and an alternative realization of the Extended-BEPU. In this study, the generic Generation-III Pressurized Water Reactor design was investigated to demonstrate the methodology with a practical example. The Postulated Initiating Event was a surge line double-ended break (SL-LOCA), a variant of the Large Break Loss of Coolant Accident (LB-LOCA), and considered an example of the Design Basis Event. The considered reactor design passed successfully through the procedure with a large margin due to the robustness of its safety systems. © 2022 The Author(s)","BEPU; Deterministic safety analysis; E-BEPU; Extended BEPU; LOCA; Probabilistic safety analysis; Reactor safety analysis; Risk-informed methods","Availability; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Pressurized water reactors; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Security systems; Uncertainty analysis; BEPU; Best estimates; Deterministic safety analyse; Deterministics; Extended BEPU; Extended best estimate plus uncertainty; Probabilistic safety analysis; Reactor safety analysis; Risk-informed method; Safety analysis; Uncertainty; Loss of coolant accidents","","","","","International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA; OECD; ; NRG; H2020 Euratom, (755439); H2020 Euratom; Horizon 2020 NARSIS, (CSNI2021/01 - ROSA-2)","This project has received funding from the Euratom research and training programme 2014-2018 under Grant agreement no. 755439 - project Horizon 2020 NARSIS (New Approach to Reactor Safety Improvements).

A layer is created on which other layers are placed until the object is finished. It is the orientation of these fibers that greatly affects the resulting mechanical properties. Therefore, the printed object behaves orthotropic. The material does not blend perfectly or evenly between the individual fibers, which is why the resulting strength is limited by adhesion. Within the fibers themselves, it is also its dimension that affects the size of the contact surface and therefore the effect of adhesion. This contribution aims to compare the effect of fiber size in a given direction and its rotation in 3-point bending according to the standard ČSN EN ISO 178. The maximum bending load force was obtained and the bending stress and modulus of elasticity were determined. The influence of layer cohesion on the failure of the specimens is compared. One of the other important studied aspects for the effective production is the printing time of each specimen. © 2022, Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

The beam is formed by an array of fiber lasers with the controllable phase and multidirectional linear polarization. The phase control is based on the well-known SPGD optimization algorithm combined with the phase corrector in the feedback loop. The numerical model demonstrates establishment of phase relations between array elements in the dynamic process of SPGD optimization and is actually a “digital twin” of the experiment. It is found that for the experiments with the adaptive mirror (AM) and with the spatial light modulator (SLM) as a phase corrector, identical target spatial structures in the target plane are achieved at different phase distributions in the initial plane. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Coherent beam combining; Cylindrical vector beam; Fiber laser; Spatial light modulator; Spatial structure of beams; Vector beam; Vortex beam","Fiber lasers; Light modulation; Polarization; A.Fibres; Coherent beam combining; Cylindrical vector beam; Phase correctors; Spatial light modulators; Spatial structure; Spatial structure of beam; Synthesised; Vector beams; Vortex beams; Light modulators","","","","","","","Zhan Q., Cylindrical vector beams: from mathematical concepts to applications, Adv.

Although the emergence of bioprinting techniques has given rise to the creating of living materials with rationally designed properties, a challenge is the controlling of the printability of the cell-laden bioinks while maintaining the high viability of cells. Here, we present an annealable granular hydrogel system that can encapsulate and compartment microorganisms for the 3D printing of biocatalytic living materials. Yeast-laden hydrogel microparticles (HMPs) are generated by a droplet-based microfluidic preparation process and then are jammed into granular hydrogels with shear-thinning and self-recovery behaviors. Upon extrusion-based 3D printing, the jammed HMPs are able to deposit into a designated structure and can be further annealed by interparticle cross-linking. Using HMPs as microorganism carriers, yeast cells are protected by encapsulation and survive shear forces during 3D printing. Further, printed constructs display enhanced catalytic activity, which show increased ethanol production due to improved mass transfer. The combination of annealable granular hydrogels and 3D printing should enable novel routes to produce microorganisms-based living materials with further applications in bioremediation, biosensing and biomedicine. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","","3D printers; Bioremediation; Catalyst activity; Cells; Cytology; Hydrogels; Mass transfer; Shear thinning; Yeast; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Bioprinting; Droplet-based microfluidics; Energy; Granular hydrogels; Hydrogel system; Micro particles; Performance; Property; Microorganisms","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (21901117, 32111530117); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (BK20190674); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; State Key Laboratory of Materials- Oriented Chemical Engineering, MEC, (KL20-02); State Key Laboratory of Materials- Oriented Chemical Engineering, MEC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFC2104300); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work was supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFC2104300) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21901117, 32111530117).

While cadaveric specimens are generally used to demonstrate realistic anatomy, high cost, ethical considerations and limited accessibility can often impede their suitability for use as teaching tools. This study aimed to develop an alternative to traditional teaching methods; a novel teaching tool using augmented reality (AR) and three-dimensional (3D) printed models to accurately demonstrate normal ankle and foot anatomy. An open-source software (3D Slicer) was used to segment a high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset of a healthy volunteer ankle and produce virtual bone and musculature objects. Bone and musculature were segmented using seed-planting and interpolation functions, respectively. Virtual models were imported into Unity 3D, which was used to develop user interface and achieve interactability prior to export to the Microsoft HoloLens 2. Three life-size models of bony anatomy were printed in yellow polylactic acid and thermoplastic polyurethane, with another model printed in white Visijet SL Flex with a supporting base attached to its plantar aspect. Interactive user interface with functional toggle switches was developed. Object recognition did not function as intended, with adequate tracking and AR superimposition not achieved. The models accurately demonstrate bony foot and ankle anatomy in relation to the associated musculature. Although segmentation outcomes were sufficient, the process was highly time consuming, with effective object recognition tools relatively inaccessible. This may limit the reproducibility of augmented reality learning tools on a larger scale. Research is required to determine the extent to which this tool accurately demonstrates anatomy and ascertain whether use of this tool improves learning outcomes and is effective for teaching anatomy. © 2022 by the authors.","anatomy; anatomy education; augmented reality; enhanced visualisation; Microsoft HoloLens 2; simulation; three-dimensional printing","3D printers; Magnetic resonance imaging; Object recognition; Open source software; Open systems; Seed; User interfaces; Visualization; Anatomy; Anatomy educations; Enhanced visualization; MicroSoft; Microsoft hololens 2; Normal anatomy; Objects recognition; Simulation; Teaching tools; Three-dimensional-printing; Augmented reality","","","","","Curtin University of Technology","This research was funded by the Curtin University HIVE Summer Internship (2021–2022).","Bork F., Stratmann L., Enssle S., Eck U., Navab N., Waschke J., Kugelmann D., The benefits of an augmented reality magic mirror system for integrated radiology teaching in gross anatomy, Anat.

However, limited research has been presented on the mechanism, evaluation index and control methods of such progressive failure. Therefore, based on an overturning collapse accident of an excavation retained by double-row piles, this paper uses the finite difference method (FDM) to study the OPC mechanism. The influence of local over-excavation on the internal force, displacement and stability of double-row piles was analyzed. To evaluate the risk of OPC, the anti-overturning stability value (ASV) and modified overturning stability index (MOSI) were proposed as evaluation indexes of overturning displacement and overturning stability. The results show that overturning collapse in the local over-excavation area (LOA) developed to adjacent retaining structures through the loading effect of the soil arch in the active zone, the unloading effect of the soil in the passive zone and the load transfer effect of the capping beam. The ASV can be used to predict the scale of retaining piles that will experience additional displacement caused by local over-excavation. Compared with the traditional overturning stability index (OSI) and the ASV, the MOSI can better reflect the occurrence of OPC and its scale. A capping beam cannot reduce the risk of progressive failure but will increase the risk and degree of OPC, which is different from the progressive bending collapse of cantilever excavations. Therefore, when calculating the overturning stability of retaining structures without considering the load transfer effect of the capping beam, the scale of the OPC outside the LOA will be severely underestimated. Extending the retaining piles and reinforcing the soil in the passive zone in the LOA can control the development of OPC, but the two measures have their own limitations and should be selected according to specific project conditions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Deep excavation; Excavation safety; FDM; Overturning failure; Progressive collapse; Retaining piles","Failure (mechanical); Finite difference method; Nanocantilevers; Piles; Soils; Stability; Structural dynamics; Unloading; Anti-overturning; Deep excavation; Excavation safety; Finite-difference methods; Overexcavation; Overturning failure; Overturning stability; Progressive collapse; Retaining piles; Stability indices; Excavation","","","","","Ministry of Education Open Science Foundation, (TUC2021-01); Research and Development Program of China Construction Second Engineering Bureau LTD, (91110000100024296D200003); Research and Development Program of China State Construction Engineering Corporation LTD, (CSCEC-2021-Z-25); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52178343)","This work was supported by Key Projects in the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52178343), the Research Center of Tunneling and Underground Engineering of Ministry of Education Open Science Foundation (Grant No. TUC2021-01), the Research and Development Program of China Construction Second Engineering Bureau LTD (91110000100024296D200003) and the Research and Development Program of China State Construction Engineering Corporation LTD (CSCEC-2021-Z-25).

There have been challenges for LPBF-fabricating 2xxx (Al–Cu) alloy because that own alloy elements cause large solidification ranges and hot cracking is susceptible to generate during solidification. In this study, a crack-free and high-strength Al–Cu–Mg–Mn–Zr alloy was designed and manufactured by LPBF. The results showed that the laser energy density has an important effect on microstructure and density, and it was sufficient to melt the alloy powder and deliver high-quality builds at 333 J/mm3. The microhardness, tensile strength, and yield strength of the LPBF-fabricated Al–Cu–Mg–Mn–Zr alloy increased with increasing laser energy density. In addition, the tensile fracture surfaces exhibited mixed brittle and ductile fracture features at low energy density values (231–358J/mm3). The ductile fracture was observed at higher energy density values (>463J/mm3). When the laser density was set at 500 J/mm3, the LPBF-fabricated alloy exhibited high relative density (99.88%) and the most optimal mechanical properties, with microhardness of 141.5 Hv, tensile strength of 343.9 MPa, yield strength of 311.0 MPa, and elongation of 6.1%. After solution treatment at 560 °C for 2 h and water quenching, the Al–Cu–Mg–Mn–Zr alloy exhibits the excellent mechanical properties with ultimate tensile strength of 483.6 MPa, yield strength of 365.5 MPa, and elongation of 13.4%. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Al–Cu–Mg alloy; Cracks; Laser energy density; Laser powder bed fusion","Aluminum alloys; Copper alloys; Ductile fracture; Fabrication; High strength alloys; Magnesium alloys; Manganese alloys; Microhardness; Solidification; Tensile strength; Yield stress; Zircaloy; Al-Cu-Mg; Al-Cu-Mg alloys; Crack free; Density value; High-strength; Laser energy density; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; Zr alloys; Cracks","","","","","INTERNATIONAL, (201903D421075); Key R&D program of Shanxi Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52071299); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Major Science and Technology Project of Hainan Province, (20181101009, 20201102009); Major Science and Technology Project of Hainan Province","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52071299 ), Key R&D program of Shanxi Province (INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION, 201903D421075 ), the Major Science and Technology Projects of Shanxi Province, China (No. 20201102009 and 20181101009 ).

These droplet characteristics, in turn, determine the functional quality of the printed parts. Hence, to ensure repeatable and reliable part quality it is necessary to monitor and control the droplet characteristics. Existing approaches for in-situ monitoring of droplet behavior in DoD-LMJ rely on high-speed imaging sensors. The resulting high volume of droplet images acquired is computationally demanding to analyze and hinders real-time control of the process. To overcome this challenge, the objective of this work is to use time series data acquired from an in-process millimeter-wave sensor for predicting the size, velocity, and shape characteristics of droplets in DoD-LMJ process. As opposed to high-speed imaging, this sensor produces data-efficient time series signatures that allows rapid, real-time process monitoring. We devise machine learning models that use the millimeter-wave sensor data to predict the droplet characteristics. Specifically, we developed multilayer perceptron-based non-linear autoregressive models to predict the size and velocity of droplets. Likewise, a supervised machine learning model was trained to classify the droplet shape using the frequency spectrum information contained in the millimeter-wave sensor signatures. High-speed imaging data served as ground truth for model training and validation. These models captured the droplet characteristics with a statistical fidelity exceeding 90%, and vastly outperformed conventional statistical modeling approaches. Thus, this work achieves a practically viable sensing approach for real-time quality monitoring of the DoD-LMJ process, in lieu of the existing data-intensive image-based techniques. © 2022, The Author(s).","Droplet-on-demand liquid metal jetting (DoD-LMJ); High-speed imaging; In-process sensing and monitoring; Machine learning; Millimeter-wave sensing","3D printers; Additives; Classification (of information); Drops; Forecasting; High speed cameras; Learning systems; Liquid metals; Metals; Millimeter waves; Process monitoring; Real time control; Speed; Supervised learning; Time series; Droplet characteristics; Droplet-on-demand liquid metal jetting; High speed imaging; In-process; In-process sensing and monitoring; Machine-learning; Millimeter wave sensing; Millimeter-wave sensors; On demands; Process sensing; Process control","","","","","Joseph Tringe; , (2044710, 1739696, 1929172); ; LLNL-LDRD, (19-ERD-008, 18-SI-001); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (OIA-1929172, CMMI-1739696, CMMI-1920245, CMMI-1719388, DE-SC0021136, ECCS-2020246, CMMI-1752069, PFI-TT 2044710); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, LLNL, (DE-AC52-07-NA27344); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, LLNL","Funding text 1: The authors thank Joseph Tringe for his initial conception and support of in-situ droplet detection efforts at LLNL.; Funding text 2: This work was performed in part under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) under contract DE-AC52-07-NA27344 and supported by the LLNL-LDRD Program under Project Nos. 19-ERD-008 and 18-SI-001.

Of the seven products evaluated, three were block format (B), two were spreadable (S) and two were spreadable light (SL), with fat contents ranging from 13.7 to 35.7%. The majority of cream cheese products indicated the inclusion of starter culture, and all formulations contained one or more stabilisers. Protein/moisture (p/m) ratio, i.e. the effective protein concentration in the non-fat substance, was seen to most strongly correlate with material properties, with a positive slope for fracture stress (R2 = 0.808) and modulus of deformability (R2 = 0.721). In terms of outliers, the datapoint for SL2 on this modulus versus p/m graph was lower than its regression line, and one rationale is that lower fat content (13.7%) gave a lower modulus from the milkfat component at 10°C test temperature. B1, with the highest p/m of 0.17, had a more dense distribution of larger fat globules coated with proteins than B2 and B3. Fracture stress and modulus of deformability were noted to be higher for full-fat than for lower fat cheese. In all products, elastic characteristics dominated viscous flow as expected. Findings have demonstrated that significant variance exists across the material properties of commerical cream cheeses, and which shows specific dependencies on their formulation. © 2022 The Authors.

The aluminium solid media are composed of repeating elementary cells derived from the body-centred cubic (BCC) model and have a porosity of 87%. The samples were tested in an upright position and laterally heated by applying three different heat fluxes (10, 15, and 20 kW m−2). The experimental results showed the effects of the heat flux, melting temperature, and size of the metal cells on the temperature of the heated surface. Numerical simulations were performed to validate a simplified model for the thermal analysis of the test modules using reduced domains. Owing to the characteristics of the experimental melting front, which is almost parallel to the heated side, suggesting a negligible effect of natural convection, the numerical simulations performed with ANSYS Fluent could be conducted on computational domains that represent only small repetitive portions of the test modules, thus allowing substantial savings in the computational time. This simplified method has been proven to yield results that are in good agreement with the experimental data. Based on the numerical results, when the metal structure is finer, the evolution is faster, and the time required to completely melt the phase change material (PCM) is shorter. This numerical model may be confidently used by thermal engineers to design PCM-based heat sinks for electronics cooling. Finally, an empirical model previously developed for paraffin embedded in metal foams was applied to the present paraffin-BCC composite structures. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Electronics cooling; Numerical simulations; Paraffin; Phase change material","Additives; Aluminum; Crystal structure; Fabrication; Heat flux; Heat sinks; Melting point; Metal foams; Numerical models; Paraffins; Phase change materials; Thermoanalysis; Aluminium structures; Body-centred cubic; Cellular structure; Cellulars; Electronics cooling; Experimental and numerical studies; Phase change process; Solid liquid phase change; Solid medium; Test modules; 3D printers","","","","","Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR, (2017F7KZWS_005); Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR","The support of the MIUR through the PRIN Project 2017F7KZWS_005 is gratefully acknowledged.

Such structures are also relevant for material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEAM), whose wide diffusion is pivotal to fostering their spread. Although design approaches are available to exploit the potential of soft TPMS, there are still manufacturing constraints that lead to practical limits on the shape and size of the structures that can be produced due to the complexities related to printing flexible materials. Besides, the computational models investigating the effect of cell type, the surface-to-volume fraction, and the combination of different periodic surfaces (i.e., graded or hybrid) on the mechanical behavior of these lattices are design aspects still debated. Here, the capabilities of MEAM to produce tailored soft lattice structures are explored by combining a design tool, numerical analyses, and mechanical testing using thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) as feedstock material. The study addresses design issues, delves into optimum printing parameters, and analyzes a set of numerical parameters, which can be used for designing specific structures with tunable mechanical behavior, useful for healthcare and bioengineering. The printing parameters of three lattices, i.e., schwartz-P, gyroid, and honeycomb, with unit cell sizes spanning from 3 to 12 mm were studied. Their mechanical behavior was investigated using FEM simulations and mechanical testing. Lastly, the printability of graded and hybrid lattices with enhanced bearing-load capabilities have been demonstrated. Altogether, our findings addressed multiple challenges associated with developing soft lattice scaffolds with MEAM that can be used to fabricate innovative-engineered materials with tunable properties. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Design for additive manufacturing; Finite element analysis (FEM); Fused filament fabrication (FFF); Lattice structures; Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU); Triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS)","3D printers; Additives; Extrusion; Honeycomb structures; Mechanical testing; Polyurethanes; Reinforced plastics; Structural design; Tissue engineering; Design for additive manufacturing; Finite element analyse; Fused filament fabrication; Lattice structures; Mechanical behavior; Thermoplastic polyurethane; Thermoplastic polyurethanes; Triply periodic minimal surface; Triply periodic minimal surfaces; Finite element method","","","","","Rotary Club Milano Linate","We are grateful to Rotary Club Milano Linate, Italy for the financial support on 3D printing technology.

Oak Street, Hammond, 70402, LA, United States","A numerical model that fully account for the velocity of the traveling filament (push velocity) in the liquefier is presented in the current work to predict the pressure, temperature, outlet melt viscosity, strain rate, and velocity in the hot-end of a FFF system for printing tough-poly(lactic acid) (TPLA). The numerical model was thoroughly validated by comparing the model predictions with experimentally measured feeding force data. The predicted numerical results closely approximated the experimentally measured feeding force. Then the model was also validated with extrudate temperature, measured with a thermal imaging camera, and the results obtained are in good agreement. Outlet capillary diameter, feeding rate, and heat flux (quantified in terms of Nusselt number) were varied to determine the response of pressure field, temperature, velocity, viscosity, and strain rate in the liquefier. The results show that an increase in the nozzle outlet diameter decreases the extrusion pressure in the hot-end. The maximum pressure predicted for TPLA is 3.34, 2.91, and 2.04 MPa for the 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mm outlet diameters nozzles, respectively. Also, an increase in the nozzle outlet diameter decreases the central velocity at the outlet and decreases the shear rate with an increase in the viscosity of TPLA at the exit during material extrusion. The area-weighted averaged outlet temperature for TPLA decreases as the feeding rate increases for all three nozzle diameters. Elucidated from the simulation results, significant variation of the normalized velocity at the center of the nozzle outlet suggests that different printing speeds for TPLA material extrusion should be set for different nozzle diameters. Otherwise, the accuracy and precision of the gantry motion during layer deposition on the print will be compromised. The simulation results indicate that based on the 90% core melting temperature requirement, at a liquefier set temperature of 503 K, the TPLA should be printed below 80mm/min for all outlet diameters considered. A Nusselt number of 49.61 was observed to be the upper limit where an increase in the heat flux in the liquefier has no significant effect on the area-weighted averaged outlet temperature of TPLA. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Hot-end; Melting; Nozzle diameter; Numerical model; Semicrystalline","Extrusion; Heat flux; Infrared imaging; Melting; Nusselt number; Shear flow; Velocity; Viscosity; Feeding rate; Hot-end; Melting; Nozzle diameter; Outlet diameters; Outlet temperature; Poly lactic acid; Polymer flows; Semicrystallines; Strain-rates; Numerical models","","","","","Digital Manufacturing & Distribution Lab; Texas A and M University, TAMU; Texas A and M Engineering Experiment Station, Texas A and M University, TEES","We thank Professor Ufodike Research Group (PURG), and the Digital Manufacturing & Distribution Lab (DMD-Lab) Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX.","Go J., Schiffres S.N., Stevens A.G., Hart A.J., Rate limits of additive manufacturing by fused filament fabrication and guidelines for high-throughput system design, Addit Manuf, 16, pp. 1-11, (2017); Turner B.N., Strong R., Gold S.A., A review of melt extrusion additive manufacturing processes: I.

This article presents a novel programmable design for soft pneumatic bellows-shaped actuators with distinct motions, thus a wide range of functionalities can be engendered through tuning channel parameters. According to the design principle, a kinematic model is established for motion prediction, and a sampling-based optimal parameter search is executed for automatic design. The proposed design method and kinematic models provide a tool for the generation of an optimal channel curve, with respect to target functions and required motion trajectories. Quantitative characterizations on the analytical model are conducted. To validate the functionalities, we generate three types of actuators to cover a wide range of motions in manipulation and locomotion tasks. Comparisons of model prediction on motion trajectory and prototype performance indicate the efficacy of the forward kinematics, and two task-based optimal designs for manipulation scenarios validate the effectiveness of the design parameter search. Prototyped by additive manufacturing technique with soft matter, multifunctional robots in case studies have been demonstrated, suggesting adaptability of the structure and convenience of the soft actuator's automatic design in both manipulation and locomotion. Results show that the novel design method together with the kinematic model paves a way for designing function-oriented actuators in an automatic flow.  © 2022 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","kinematic modeling; locomotion; manipulation; modular robotics; programmable modality; soft robotics; task-oriented design","Equipment Design; Motion; Robotics; Kinematics; Motion estimation; Pneumatic actuators; Robotics; Automatic design; Kinematics models; Locomotion; Manipulation; Modular robotics; Programmable modality; Soft actuators; Soft robotics; Task-oriented; Task-oriented design; equipment design; motion; procedures; robotics; Machine design","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52005269); Innovation and Technology Fund, ITF, (ITS-018-17FP)","This research is supported by the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF) ITS-018-17FP, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52005269).

Fractal antennas have become popular in this context owing to the three properties: self-similarity, space-filling, and lacunarity, thereby producing miniaturization with a broad spectrum. Conventional Fractal antennas achieve a good impedance bandwidth, relatively high gain, at the cost of trade-off between compact size, radiation characteristics and broad spectrum. In this paper, an asymmetric coplanar waveguide–fed hexagonal monopole antenna with Boomerang-shaped Fractals is proposed for UWB characteristics with relatively high antenna gain and wide bandwidth. The miniaturization of the antenna is realized by the Fractal structure. The size of the antenna is to be 0.287 λr × 0.287 λr × 0.009 λr, where λr is the resonating wavelength at 3.45 GHz. The proposed antenna is printed on a 0.8-mm-thick FR-4 substrate with relative dielectric constant of 4.4 and a loss tangent of 0.02. From frequency-domain analysis, the experimental results reveal that the fractional bandwidth is 101.7% and the peak antenna gain detected is 5.1 dBi. The radiation performance of the antenna was nearly omnidirectional. From the time-domain analysis, group delay and three different Fidelity Factors i.e. Fidelity Factor (FF), System Fidelity Factor (SFF), and Fidelity Factor of System (FFS), the proposed antenna is found to have negligible distortion. As the bandwidth meets up to fractional bandwidth above 20% and absolute bandwidth greater than 500 MHz, the proposed antenna is suitable for 3.45–10.6 GHz UWB applications. © 2022 De Gruyter.

In order to achieve this aim, the vector Helmholtz equation is used to avoid the convergence problems in Maxwell’s equations, and the corresponding fields are divided into primary and secondary components. We use the finite difference method on a staggered grid to discretize the equations, which can be performed in two ways including the conventional and improved finite difference methods. The former is very complex in terms of programming, which causes errors. Furthermore, it requires different programming loops over each point of the grid, which increases the program’s running time. The latter is the improved finite difference method (IFDM), in which pre-made derivative matrices can be used. These pre-made derivative matrices can be incorporated into the derivative equations and convert them directly from the derivative form to the matrix form. After having the matrix form system of linear equations, Ax = b is solved by the quasi-minimal residual (QMR). IFDM does not have the complexities of the conventional method, and requires much less execution time to form a stiffness or coefficient matrix. Moreover, its programing process is simple. Our code uses parallel computing, which gives us the ability to calculate the fields for all transmitter positions at the same time, and because we use sparse matrices thorough the code memory space, requires to store the files is less than 100 MB compared with normal matrices that require more than 15 GB space in the same grid size. We implement IFDM to simulate the earth’s responses. In order to validate, we compare our results with various models including the 3D and 2D models, and anisotropic conductivity. The results show a good fit in comparison with the FDM solution of Newman and the appropriate fit integral equations solution of Avdeev that is because of the different solution methods. © 2022, Shahrood University of Technology.

For this purpose, samples with 30 strips were printed with an FDM printer. Each strip was measured at 4000 points using image processing method. To investigate the effect of the manufacturing parameters, a linear regression model was created based on the experimental data. The numerical model was created and validated comparing with the experimental results, and optimum nozzle channel geometry was obtained using the validated numerical model. Nozzles with the optimal channel geometries were manufactured and new samples were printed for comparison. Based on the experimental results, the strip width increased along the printing direction and ABS showed more swelling than PLA and CPE. The effects of feed rate, temperature, and measurement position on strip widths were evident for all materials. The results showed that the anticipated strip widths can be obtained for all materials using the optimized nozzle channel geometries. Thus, the dimensional accuracy of the 3D-printed parts can be improved using the optimized nozzles. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS); Co-polyester (CPE); Finite-element method (FEM); Fused deposition modeling (FDM); Level set method; Optimization; Polylactic acid (PLA)","","","","","","TÜBİTAK, (217M687)","This work was supported by TÜBİTAK Project No: 217M687.

The mechanism of Cr element aggregation at the grain boundaries was revealed by analyzing the evolution of particle structure, diffusion activation energy, and interactions among solute elements during the unique heating process of PDS. In addition, the microstructure of the PDS-built 316L samples was characterized to verify such an aggregation phenomenon. It was found that the self-diffusion coefficient of Cr element increased substantially at the 1600 K holding stage. Meanwhile, Cr element was diffused to grain boundary and formed severe grain boundary aggregation due to its lower diffusion activation energy and stronger interactions between atoms. Moreover, the extra energy released due to this aggregation phenomenon promoted a further coalescence of particles. This study provides an atomic-scale understanding of sintering behavior of PDS-built Fe-based alloys, which paves a way for the multiscale modeling of the sintering process in PDS of other alloy systems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Molecular dynamics; Printing-debinding-sintering process; Sintering mechanism; Stainless steel","3D printers; Activation energy; Additives; Agglomeration; Chromium; Chromium alloys; Costs; Diffusion in liquids; Filled polymers; Grain boundaries; Powder metals; Sintering; Stainless steel; Aggregation phenomena; Conventional metals; Debinding; Diffusion activation energy; Dynamics simulation; Grain-boundaries; Metal parts; Printing-debinding-sintering process; Sintering mechanism; Sintering process; Molecular dynamics","","","","","","","Wu H.R., Lei S.T., A review of bone graft substitutes made from ha-polymer composite scaffolds and fabrication potential with laser-based additive manufacturing processes, 10th ASME Int.

Aluminum alloys are particularly studied due to their good mechanical properties and low weight. In this investigation, structured layer walls were fabricated by reproducing a WAAM process with a GMAW welding equipment adapted to a robotic arm for welding processes. AlMg5Cr alloy was used as a filler metal to deposit layers on the surface of an Aluminum 6061-T6 plate in metal transfer pulsed mode. After the WAAM process, the presence β-Al3Mg2Si hardening phase was found in the samples. This phase is responsible of high mechanical strength in such Aluminum alloy, and its formation is related to the heat flux from the arc. Moreover, a high heat flux value contributes to a low porosity and good homogeneity of the layered structure, thus promoting the increase of the mechanical resistance. The best results were obtained in samples manufactured at 200 A, with a Qnet = 7.22 kJ/s. Specimens for tensile testing were obtained in a horizontal plane (parallel to the direction of the layers) and vertical (perpendicular to the layers’ boundary). The vertical specimens reached up to 267 MPa and they were better than the horizontal specimens because a better distribution of the stress along the layer. In all cases, the predominating failure mechanism was determined as ductile–brittle intergranular. © 2022, ASM International.","AlMg<sub>5</sub>Cr alloy; beta phase; heat input; mechanical properties; wire arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Chromium alloys; Failure (mechanical); Filler metals; Heat resistance; Metals; Plate metal; Tensile testing; Ternary alloys; Textures; Wire; Additive manufacturing process; Almg5cr alloy; Beta-phase; Failure mechanism; Heat input; Mechanical performance; Metal transfers; Pulsed mode; Wire arc; Wire arc additive manufacturing; Aluminum alloys","","","","","","","Martin J.H., Yahata B.D., Hundley J.M., Mayer J.A., Schaedler T.A., Pollock T.M., 3D Printing of High-Strength Aluminium Alloys, Nature, 549, pp. 365-369, (2017); Agarwala M., Bourell D., Beaman J., Marcus H., Barlow J., Direct Selective Laser Sintering of Metals, Rapid Prototyp.

Three-dimensional (3D) advanced additive manufacturing technologies allow creating scaffolds with controlled and reproducible macro- and micro-structure that improve the quality of the restored tissue to favor spontaneous repair. However, when persistent inflammation occurs, the physiological tissue healing capacity is reduced, like in the presence of pathologies like diabetes, vascular diseases, chronic infection, and others. In these circumstances, the bioavailability of therapeutic adjuncts like the growth factors in addition to the standard treatments represents undoubtedly a promising strategy to accelerate the healing of skin lesions. Precisely designed polysaccharide scaffolds obtained by 3D printing represent a robust platform that can be further implemented with the controlled delivery of bioactive adjuncts. Human elastin-like polypeptides (HELPs) are stimuli-responsive biopolymers. Their structure allows the integration of domains endowed with biological functionality, making them attractive compounds to prepare composites with smart properties. In the present study, 3D-printed alginate and chitosan scaffolds were combined with the HELP components. The HELP biopolymer was fused to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) as the bioactive domain. Different constructs were prepared and the stimuli-responsive behavior as well as the biological activity were evaluated, suggesting that these smart bioactive composites are suitable to realize multifunctional dressings that sustain the local release of therapeutic adjuncts. © 2021 The Authors.

Several factors are involved in this phenomenon, which makes it difficult to predict. The present study aimed to develop a model to predict the collapse settlement and coefficient of stress release of sandy gravel soil through evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR). To achieve this, a dataset containing 180 records obtained from a large-scale direct shear test was used. In this study, five models were developed with the secant hyperbolic, tangent hyperbolic, natural logarithm, exponential, and sinusoidal inner functions. Using sand content (SC), normal stress ((Formula presented.)), shear stress level (SL), and relative density (Dr) values, the models can predict the collapse settlement (∆H) and coefficient of stress release (CSR). The results indicated that the models developed with the exponential functions were the best models. With these models, the values of (Formula presented.) for training, testing, and all data in the prediction of collapse settlement were 0.9759, 0.9759, and 0.9757, respectively, and the values of (Formula presented.) in predicting the coefficient of stress release were 0.9833, 0.9820, and 0.9833, respectively. The sensitivity analysis also revealed that the sand content (SC) and relative density (Dr) parameters had the highest and lowest degrees of importance in predicting collapse settlement. In contrast, the Dr and SC parameters showed the highest and lowest degrees of importance in predicting the coefficient of stress release. Finally, the conducted parametric study showed that the developed models were in line with the results of previous studies. © 2022 by the authors.","coefficient of stress release; collapse settlement; evolutionary polynomial regression; modelling; sandy gravel soil","","","","","","","","Wei K., Study on Collapse Behaviors of Coarse Grained Soils, Period.

This condition can be more problematic when a damaged zone is also developed (due to poor quality blasting). In this paper, a theoretical solution is presented to predict long-term tunnel convergence and long-term induced lining pressure, considering the existence of an altered zone due to excavation. The rheological behaviour of rock mass and the altered zone is simulated by viscoelastic behaviour obeying the Burgers model. It is also assumed that a continuous lining, i.e., a shotcrete layer, is placed (with elastic behaviour) to confine the convergence. A comprehensive parametric study is performed by the presented solution to evaluate the effects of various parameters on the induced lining pressures and the tunnel convergence. Then, to have more practical conditions, the elastic–viscoplastic rheological model (known as CVISC) is assigned to the rock mass to consider its failure. The problem is further studied by only numerical approach using FDM. The results show that the support installation time and the radius of the altered zone have remarkable effects on the output results. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Burgers model; CVISC model; Damaged zone; Deep tunnels; Rheological rock; Shotcrete","Linings; Rock mechanics; Shotcrete; Shotcreting; Tunneling (excavation); Burger model; Condition; CVISC model; Damaged zones; Deep tunnels; Lining pressures; Long-term behavior; Rheological rock; Rock-mass; Tunnel convergences; analytical method; installation; long-term change; numerical method; numerical model; prediction; rheology; simulation; soft rock; tunnel; Rocks","","","","","","","Alonso E., Alejano L.R., Varas F., Fdez-Manin G., Carranza-Torres C., Ground response curves for rock masses exhibiting strain-softening behaviour, Int J Numer Anal Meth Geomech, 27, 13, pp. 1153-1185, (2003); Arora K., Gutierrez M., Hedayat A., Cruz E.C., Time-dependent behavior of the tunnels in squeezing ground: an experimental study, Rock Mech Rock Eng, 54, 4, pp. 1755-1777, (2021); Barla G., Debernardi D., Sterpi D., Time-dependent modeling of tunnels in squeezing conditions, Int J Geomech, 12, 6, pp. 697-710, (2012); Bobet A., Einstein H., Tunnel reinforcement with rockbolts, Tunn Undergr Space Technol, 26, 1, pp. 100-123, (2011); Brown E.T., Bray J.W., Ladanyi B., Hoek E., Ground response curves for rock tunnels, J Geotech Eng, 109, 1, pp. 15-39, (1983); Chu Z., Wu Z., Liu B., Liu Q., Coupled analytical solutions for deep-buried circular lined tunnels considering tunnel face advancement and soft rock rheology effects, Tunn Undergr Space Technol, 94, (2019); Chu Z., Wu Z., Liu Q., Liu B., Analytical solutions for deep-buried lined tunnels considering longitudinal discontinuous excavation in rheological rock mass, J Eng Mech, 146, 6, (2020); Chu Z., Wu Z., Liu Q., Liu B., Sun J., Analytical solution for lined circular tunnels in deep viscoelastic burgers rock considering the longitudinal discontinuous excavation and sequential installation of liners, J Eng Mech, 147, 4, (2021); Do D.-P., Tran N.-T., Mai V.-T., Hoxha D., Vu M.-N., Time-dependent reliability analysis of deep tunnel in the viscoelastic burger rock with sequential installation of liners, Rock Mech Rock Eng, 53, 3, pp. 1259-1285, (2020); Fahimifar A., Ranjbarnia M., Analytical approach for the design of active grouted rockbolts in tunnel stability based on convergence-confinement method, Tunn Undergr Space Technol, 24, 4, pp. 363-375, (2009); Fahimifar A., Tehrani F.M., Hedayat A., Vakilzadeh A., Analytical solution for the excavation of circular tunnels in a visco-elastic Burger’s material under hydrostatic stress field, Tunn Undergr Space Technol, 25, 4, pp. 297-304, (2010); Fan Y., Zheng J.W., Cui X.Z., Leng Z.D., Wang F., Lv C.C., Damage zones induced by in situ stress unloading during excavation of diversion tunnels for the Jinping II hydropower project, Bull Eng Geol Env, 80, 6, pp. 4689-4715, (2021); Fang Q., Zhang D., Zhou P., Wong L.N.Y., Ground reaction curves for deep circular tunnels considering the effect of ground reinforcement, Int J Rock Mech Min Sci, 60, pp. 401-412, (2013); Giordanella M., Ranjbarnia M., Oreste P., Zaheri M., Study of the systematic fully grouted rock bolts performance in tunnels considering installation condition of bolt head, Geomech Geoeng, (2021); Hedayat A., Weems J., The elasto-plastic response of deep tunnels with damaged zone and gravity effects, Rock Mech Rock Eng, (2019); Hedayat A., Stability of circular tunnels excavated in rock masses under gravity loading.

A method of 5-axis Laser Hot-Wire Directed Energy Deposition is developed and demonstrated in this study using an 8-axis industrial robot, comprised of a 6-axis serial link robot and a 2 degree‐of‐freedom positioner. Coordinated 5-axis motion is used to print Ti-6Al-4V objects predominantly through build plate rotation. Methods of slicing and toolpath generation are presented, including the use of an alternating toolpath direction philosophy and the manipulation of the CAD model surface normal vectors for determining the required build plate tilt angles for maintaining consistent deposition orientations relative to gravity. Another objective of the study was to determine the limits of conventional slicing and layer height control techniques for printing geometries with significant unsupported overhangs. A comparison is made between the behavior of normal and conformal bead alignment in this regard, and the performance of the layer height controller is reported as it relates to process stability and the limits of printing overhang geometries. Unsupported overhangs were successfully printed at 35° without build plate tilt and 45° with build plate tilt. Toolpath velocity and net-shape printing performance are reported as well, with 3D scans of the printed surfaces used for net-shape characterization. In all, the printing of three geometries is presented, including the overhang geometry, a 5-axis toolpath geometry, and a large-scale, multi-bead demonstrator part, which exceeded 500 mm in height and weighed 44 kg (97 lbs). © 2022 The Authors","5-Axis; Directed energy deposition; Laser; Robotics; Slicing; Titanium","Aluminum alloys; Computer aided design; Deposition; Industrial robots; Process control; Robot programming; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; 5-axis; Directed energy; Directed energy deposition; Energy depositions; Net-shape; Planning strategies; Robot motion; Slicing; Titania; Toolpaths; Geometry","","","","","Alex Roschli; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Advanced Manufacturing Office, AMO, (CRADA NFE-15–05725); Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy , Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy , Advanced Manufacturing Office , under CRADA NFE-15–05725, in partnership with GKN Aerospace, USA.

The method utilises construction and demolition waste (CDW) [hollow brick (HB), red clay brick (RCB), roof tile (RT), and glass (G)] as a sustainable resource for geopolymers production to replace Portland cement. The life cycle assessment is performed to identify hotspots (relevant processes or raw material) to improve the environmental performance of the whole process at an early stage of development and to evaluate the environmental impacts of energy, water, and waste emissions at various points in the life cycle. The CDW requires crushing, milling/grinding, and mixing with electrical input to produce the geopolymer binders. The alkali activators' composition [6.25M NaOH, 10% Ca(OH)2] is selected as the base case for the assessment. The life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results show the environmental impacts to be 635 (kg CO2 eq.), 5.06 (kg SO2 eq.), 0.104 (kg N eq.), 3.14E-10 (kg N eq.), and 12.2 (CTUe.) for the global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP), ozone layer depletion potential (ODP), and Ecotox air respectively for 1 m3 of geopolymer binder produced. Electricity contributes over 60% to the GWP, AP, EP, and Ecotox Air; therefore, a sensitivity analysis is performed with varying sources of renewable electricity. Also, compared to ordinary Portland cement (OPC), the GWP for the geopolymer binder produced is 21% less. © 2022 The Authors","3D printing; Concrete; Geopolymers; Life cycle assessment; Sustainability","","","","","","Qatar National Research Fund, QNRF; Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu, TÜBİTAK, (AICC02-0429-190014); Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu, TÜBİTAK","This publication was made possible by the TÜBİTAK—QNRF Joint Funding Program grant ( AICC02-0429-190014 ) from the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) and Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF) .

Despite the tremendous promise of invasive brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs), the associated study costs, risks, and ethical considerations limit the opportunity to develop and test the algorithms that decode neural activity into a user’s intentions. Our goal was to address this challenge by designing an iBCI model capable of testing many human subjects in closed-loop. Approach. We developed an iBCI model that uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) to translate human finger movements into realistic motor cortex firing patterns, which can then be decoded in real time. We call the model the joint angle BCI, or jaBCI. jaBCI allows readily recruited, healthy subjects to perform closed-loop iBCI tasks using any neural decoder, preserving subjects’ control-relevant short-latency error correction and learning dynamics. Main results. We validated jaBCI offline through emulated neuron firing statistics, confirming that emulated neural signals have firing rates, low-dimensional PCA geometry, and rotational jPCA dynamics that are quite similar to the actual neurons (recorded in monkey M1) on which we trained the ANN. We also tested jaBCI in closed-loop experiments, our single study examining roughly as many subjects as have been tested world-wide with iBCIs (n = 25). Performance was consistent with that of the paralyzed, human iBCI users with implanted intracortical electrodes. jaBCI allowed us to imitate the experimental protocols (e.g. the same velocity Kalman filter decoder and center-out task) and compute the same seven behavioral measures used in three critical studies. Significance. These encouraging results suggest the jaBCI’s real-time firing rate emulation is a useful means to provide statistically robust sample sizes for rapid prototyping and optimization of decoding algorithms, the study of bi-directional learning in iBCIs, and improving iBCI control. © 2022 The Author(s).

Although models exist that analyze the cost structure of AM, these costs can vary between different machines, part designs, and production processes. The added-value and costs associated with AM as compared with conventional manufacturing (CM) should also be considered in the decision to select a make or buy strategy. No comprehensive guide for investors and practitioners is available to weigh the costs and benefits of whether to invest in AM production. This paper presents a framework that considers the production costs of AM, determines cost drivers, and guides the selection of AM machines, parts, and production parameters with potential investment in mind. The framework focuses on performance indicators of profit, throughput, and breakeven time to compare make or buy strategies from both a production and investment viewpoint, and uses a comparative value term to directly include AM-specific costs and benefits. A case study using this framework for bulk production of a sample part from literature shows cost drivers are consistent with the existing cost models. The sensitivity analysis indicates that machine investment, material, labor, and pre- and post-build times are major cost drivers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Additive manufacturing; Cost model; Engineering economy","","","","","","","","Terminology for Additive Manufacturing - General Principles - Terminology, (2015); Holmstrom J., Partanen J., Tuomi J., Walter M., Rapid manufacturing in the spare parts supply chain: alternative approaches to capacity deployment, J Manuf Technol Manag, 21, pp. 687-697, (2010); Conner B.P., Manogharan G.P., Martof A.N., Rodomsky L.M., Rodomsky C.M., Jordan D.C., Limperos J.W., Making sense of 3-D printing: creating a map of additive manufacturing products and services, Addit Manuf, 1-4, pp. 64-76, (2014); Frazier W.E., Metal additive manufacturing: a review, J Mater Eng Perform, 23, pp. 1917-1928, (2014); Ponfoort O., Krampitz C., To invest or not to invest: understanding the business cases for entering the additive manufacturing arena, Met Addit Manuf, 1, pp. 63-68, (2015); Durach C.F., Kurpjuweit S., Wagner S.M., The impact of additive manufacturing on supply chains, Int J Phys Distrib Logist Manag, 47, pp. 954-971, (2017); Gebler M., Schoot Uiterkamp A.J.M., Visser C., A global sustainability perspective on 3D printing technologies, Energy Policy, 74, pp. 158-167, (2014); Oettmeier K., Hofmann E., Impact of additive manufacturing technology adoption on supply chain management processes and components, J Manuf Technol Manag, 27, pp. 944-968, (2016); Khajavi S.H., Partanen J., Holmstrom J., Additive manufacturing in the spare parts supply chain, Comput Ind, 65, pp. 50-63, (2014); Mashhadi A.R., Esmaeilian B., Behdad S., Impact of additive manufacturing adoption on future of supply chains, ASME 2015 Int Manuf Sci and Eng Conf, (2015); Hopkinson N., Dickens P., Rapid prototyping for direct manufacture, Rapid Prototyp J, 7, pp. 197-202, (2001); Thomas D.S., Gilbert S.W., Costs and cost effectiveness of additive manufacturing.

As a member of the elementary cubic truss family, the simple-cubic truss lattice possesses the highest stiffness and strength along the principal directions and plays an important role in load-bearing mechanical metamaterials. High anisotropic mechanical properties and low resistance to buckling loading and shearing loading, however, limit its use in energy absorption. Here, we present a class of simple-cubic closed tubular lattice with limited loading direction dependence along with high mechanical properties and irregular stable post-yield response. The fabrication of its complex structure was made possible by direct laser writing at the microscale. Experiments and simulations demonstrate that both the elastic modulus and the yield strength of the simple-cubic closed tubular lattice are significantly larger than those of the simple-cubic truss lattice, regardless of the loading direction. At a relative density of 0.1 and compared to the truss lattice, the closed tubular lattice can absorb respectively 4.45 times and 6.14 times as much energy along directions [100] and [110]. The average normalized Young's modulus and yield strength are respectively 28% and 53% larger than those of the most outstanding shellular metamaterial with the same mass. Such excellent mechanical properties make it a potential candidate for applications to load-bearing and energy absorption. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Energy absorption; Lightweight structure; Loading support; Mechanical metamaterial","Bearing capacity; Bearings (machine parts); Buckling; Elastic moduli; Energy absorption; Metamaterials; Trusses; Energy absorbers; Lightweight structures; Load-bearing; Loadbearing structure; Loading direction; Loading support; Mechanical; Mechanical metamaterial; Simple cubic; Tubulars; Yield stress","","","","","EIPHI, (ANR-15-IDEX-03, ANR-17-EURE-0002); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11672089, 11732002); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by the EIPHI Graduate School [grant number ANR-17-EURE-0002 ]; the French Investissements d’Avenir program, project ISITEBFC [grant number ANR-15-IDEX-03 ]; and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 11732002 and 11672089 ].

Few past studies focused on the correlation between macroscopic fatigue residual life and the micro-/meso-scale defect evolution He (Fatigue Fract. Eng. Mater. Struct. 36: 102-114, 2013), Shanyavskiy (AIP Conf. Proc. 2167: 020324, 2019), Tang (Int. J. Fatigue 70: 270 277, 2015). This study explores the fatigue damage with three significant contributions: (1) one of the first studies on predicting fatigue residual life at different load stages without prior knowledge of the load history, (2) a new multiscale fatigue damage index for linking of micro-/meso-scale defects and damage to macroscale high-cycle fatigue life, and (3) a novel incremental evaluation method for fatigue damage. A series of coordinated materials tests were conducted along with the corresponding numerical simulations. Experimental results indicate that our multiscale fatigue damage index (MFDI) is significantly better than the state of the art in terms of the correlation with actual fatigue life of test specimens and MFDI may serve as an ideal fatigue damage signature for nondestructive inspection of fatigue residual life. Our MFDI can also be potentially utilized to evaluate the impact of micro-/meso-scale defects and damage in new manufacturing processes of materials such as additive manufacturing and nanomaterials manufacturing. © 2022, ASM International.","additive manufacturing; fatigue damage; fatigue life; lightweight materials; materials defects; microstructure; nanomaterials","3D printers; Additives; Damage detection; Defects; Nanostructured materials; Nondestructive examination; Critical component; Critical structures; Damage index; Engineering practices; Fatigue residual lives; Lightweight materials; Material defect; Meso scale; Metallic material; Service loads; Fatigue damage","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1039563, CMMI-0721625, IIP-1445355, DMI-0514900, 1039563)","This study was supported in part by U.S. National Science Foundation grants (DMI-0514900, CMMI-0721625, ECCS-1039563, and IIP-1445355).

There has been an increased demand for fast and easily constructed buildings characterized by limited space and used for a limited time, modular and flexible self-assembly homes that are reusable without compromising comfort and environmental sustainability. A highly sustainable timber-cork modular system for lightweight temporary housing (LTH) is proposed in this paper. The structure of the proposed LTH was designed as a succession of modular timber portal frames composed of spruce boards hinged together. The concept of the prototype was a full modular shelter. It was possible to interchange every piece of the building, the structural elements, and the walls with each other. Due to the modularity of the elements of which the shelter was composed, this system could offer different solutions to the events above. The proposed LTH was analyzed in terms of its structural, thermal, and environmental performance. The structural system is very reminiscent of the platform frame, characterized by a light load-bearing frame consisting of solid timber uprights and crosspieces connected to the internal frame by means of a mechanical connection. The structural FEM analysis highlighted the structure’s capacity to withstand wind with a velocity of 72 m·s-1, corresponding to the F3 of the enhanced Fujita Scale (EF Scale) of tornado damage intensity. The thermal analysis highlighted a yearly energy use of 430.49 kWh to maintain a set-point temperature indoors of 20-26°C compared with a yearly energy use of 625.93 kWh for a common container house (CH) with the same dimensions under the same environmental conditions. Finally, a Life Cycle Analysis comparison between the proposed LTH and the CH was carried out by means of the One Click LCA software. Two different scenarios of service life were considered: one of 10 years and the other of 5 years. The results highlighted the higher sustainability of the proposed LTH than that of the CH for the required service life (Req SL) period. In particular, the calculated greenhouse gas emissions of the LTH (3.52ž 103 kgCO2 eq) were less than 1/2 of the gas emissions of the CH (8.53ž 103) for a Req SL of 10 years and about 1/3 for a Req SL of 5 years. Furthermore, the LTH showed a value of biogenic carbon storage (7.76E2 kgCO2) about 6 times bigger than the temporary house container (1.31E2 kgCO2). © 2022 by the authors.

The vast range of conditions of interstellar plasma, gas, dust and high-energy cosmic rays on this “solar journey” have helped shape the solar system that we live in. Today, our protective bubble, or Heliosphere, is likely about to enter a completely new regime of interstellar space that will, yet again, change the entire heliospheric interaction and how it shields us from the interstellar environment. Interstellar Probe is a mission concept to explore the mechanisms shaping our heliosphere and represents the first step beyond our home, into the interstellar cloud to understand the evolutionary journey of our Sun, Heliosphere and Solar System. The idea of an Interstellar Probe dates back to the 1960's, when also the ideas of a probe to the Sun and its poles were formed. An international team of scientists and a team of engineers at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) are funded by NASA to study pragmatic mission concepts that would make a launch in the 2030's a reality. The ground breaking science enabled by such a mission spans not only the discipline of Solar and Space Physics, but also Planetary Sciences and Astrophysics. Detailed analyses including the upcoming SLS Block 2 and powerful stages demonstrate that asymptotic speeds around 7 Astronomical Units (au) per Year are already possible with a Jupiter Gravity Assist. Here, we give an overview of the science discoveries that await along the journey, including the physics of the heliospheric boundary and interstellar medium, the potential for exploration of Kuiper Belt Objects, the circum-solar dust disk and the extra-galactic background light. The scientific rationale, investigations and implementation of an Interstellar Probe are discussed including also example payload, trajectory design and operations. © 2022 The Authors","Heliosphere; Interstellar medium; Interstellar probe; KBO","Cosmology; NASA; Probes; Solar system; Condition; Heliospheres; High-energy cosmic rays; Interstellar environment; Interstellar medias; Interstellar plasma; Interstellar probes; KBO; Mission concepts; Plasma gas; Dust","","","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (NNN06AA01C); National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA","This work was supported by NASA Task Order NNN06AA01C .","Simpson J.A., Et al., Interim Report No. 3, (1960); McComas D.J., Et al., Local interstellar medium: six years of direct sampling by IBEX, Astrophys.

This open porosity ultimately plays a role in determining the mechanical properties of printed parts. The shape, size, and amount of porosity within a printed part is influenced by a variety of factors, including nozzle diameter, infill percentage, layer height, raster orientation, and print speed. While several studies have investigated these and other parameters’ effects on mechanical performance and porosity, better understanding the interconnected relationships is crucial in balancing the various input parameters to achieve maximum strength. This work initially examined the influence of key print parameters (infill percentage and layer height) on the internal porosity of a printed Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) part. Then, the print parameters and internal porosity were statistically correlated to final mechanical properties. Porosity was further classified as either open or closed to differentiate between connected voids in the mesostructure from isolated voids within the material itself. Mechanical performance increased with an increasing density and infill percentage, displaying a 224 % increase in elastic modulus and a 150 % increase in ultimate tensile strength. The contribution of layer height was found to be conditional upon the infill percentage. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D Printing; Extrusion; Fused Filament Fabrication; Mechanical Properties; Porosity","3D printers; Balancing; Extrusion; Infill drilling; Styrene; Tensile strength; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Ellipticals; Fused filament fabrication; Internal porosity; Layer by layer; Manufacturing IS; Mechanical performance; Open porosity; Small-scale materials; Porosity","","","","","Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Industrial Technologies Program, (DE-AC05-00OR22725); National Science Foundation, NSF, (2055529); National Science Foundation, NSF; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, ORISE; University of Tennessee, UT","Funding text 1: Research sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Industrial Technologies Program , under contract DE-AC05-00OR22725 with UT-Battelle, LLC.

Currently, most medical models are created using image thresholding and traditional mesh-based segmentation techniques to produce mono-material boundaries (STL file formats) of anatomical features. Existing medical modeling manufacturing methods restrict shape specification to one material or density, which result in anatomically simple 3D printed medical models with no gradated material qualities. Currently, available high-resolution functionally graded multimaterial 3D printed medical models are rigid and do not represent biomechanical movement. To bypass the identified limitations of current 3D printing medical modeling workflows, we present a bitmap-based ""voxel""multimaterial additive manufacturing workflow for the production of highly realistic and flexible anatomical models of the neonatal lower limb using computed tomographic (""CT"") data. By interpolating and re-slicing a biomedical volumetric data set at the native 3D printer z resolution of 27 μm and using CT scan attenuation properties (Hounsfield units) to guide material mixing ratios, producing highly realistic models of the neonatal lower limb at a significantly faster rate than other manufacturing methods. The presented medical modeling workflow has considerable potential to improve medical modeling manufacturing methods by translating medical data directly into 3D printing files aiding in anatomical education and surgical simulation practices, especially in neonatal research and clinical training.  © 2022 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","additive manufacture;

The Arburg plastic freeforming (APF) process is designed to utilize standard polymeric granules in order to print parts with properties similar to those of molded parts. Despite the emerging industrial importance of APF, the current body of knowledge regarding this technology is still very limited, especially in the field of biodegradable polymer composites. To this end, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) was reinforced with halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) by hot melt extrusion. The PLA/HNT (0–10 wt%.) composites were analyzed in terms of their rheology, morphology, and thermal and mechanical properties. A study of the processing properties of these composites in the context of APF was performed to ensure the consistency of 3D-printed, high-quality components. The optimized machine settings were used to evaluate the tensile properties of specimens printed with different axis orientations (XY and XZ) and deposition angles (0 and 45°). Specimens printed with an XY orientation and deposition angle starting at 0° resulted in the highest mechanical properties. In this study, the use of PLA/HNT composites in an APF process was reported for the first time, and the current methodology achieved satisfactory results in terms of the 3D printing and evaluation of successful PLA/HNT composites to be used as feedstock in an APF process. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing; additive manufacturing; APF process parameters; Arburg plastic freeforming (APF); biodegradable composites; halloysite nanotubes (HNTs); mechanical properties; poly(lactic acid) (PLA)","","","","","","Enterprise Ireland, (CE 20190068, TG-2017-1014); Athlone Institute of Technology, AIT, (PSF2020-DD)","This research was funded by Enterprise Ireland under the capital call of 2019, grant number CE 20190068, the Applied Polymer Technology Gateway Project No. TG-2017-1014, and the AIT President’s Seed Fund (PSF2020-DD).","Venkatesh C., Fuenmayor E., Doran P., Major I., Lyons J.G., Devine D.M., Additive manufacturing of PLA/HNT nanocomposites for biomedical applications, Procedia Manuf, 38, pp. 17-24, (2019); Dong Y., Marshall J., Haroosh H.J., Mohammadzadehmoghadam S., Liu D., Qi X., Lau K.-T., Polylactic acid (PLA)/halloysite nanotube (HNT) composite mats: Influence of HNT content and modification, Compos.

In 3D problems, the computational cost becomes even higher, whereas some mechanical systems can be regarded as axisymmetric, allowing them to be modeled as two-dimensional axisymmetric entities, resulting in a reduced computation cost. In order to decrease the computational cost further, arbitrary spatial discretization has been introduced to reduce the degrees of freedom in the system. The Particle-Element Coupled Method (PEM), the coupled method of the Material Point Method (MPM) and the Arbitrary Particle Domain Interpolation (APDI) method, enables a system to be discretized in arbitrary spatial resolutions. In this paper, PEM is extended to axisymmetric problems, whose formulation and applicability to geomaterial deformation are presented. Firstly, the axisymmetric MPM simulation of a granular column collapse experiment and its efficiency in computation are reported. Secondly, in the simulation of footing penetration, it is shown that the axisymmetric MPM and the axisymmetric PEM can be used to analyze large deformations that cannot be analyzed by mesh-based methods, such as the Finite Difference Method (FDM). The axisymmetric PEM yields equivalent average pressure–displacement relationships and shear strain distributions, realizing a reduction in the computation cost by half as much. © 2022","Axisymmetric formulation; Large deformation; Material point method; Particle element coupled method","Cost benefit analysis; Cost engineering; Cost reduction; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Finite difference method; Mesh generation; Shear strain; Axisymmetric; Axisymmetric formulation; Computational costs; Coupled method; Deformation problems; Geomaterials; Larger deformations; Material point methods; Particle element; Particle element coupled method; Deformation","","","","",", (20H00264)","","Bardenhagen S.G., Energy conservation error in the material point method for solid mechanics, J.

For this purpose, fiber-reinforcement and foam-filling methods were employed to address the material enhancement and to obtain light and tough structures with high specific energy absorption. Employing an innovated additive manufacturing based on material extrusion process, specimens of glass fiber-reinforced PLA were produced in both in-plane directions to compare with the un-reinforced counterpart. In continue, some of the 3D printed samples were strengthened by means of polyurethane foam in their hollow structure. The quasi-static compressive tests showed that the initial stiffness, collapse stress, and plateau stress were enhanced significantly in the presence of both fiber-reinforcement and foam-filling. The energy absorption behavior of the enhanced cellular structure was then simulated via finite element method and a good-agreement between experimental and numerical results was observed. Afterwards, an analytical model was proposed to validate the observed elastic stiffness of the compressive samples. In comparison with the relevant cellular configurations, it was also demonstrated that the fiber-reinforced PLA accordion cellular structures, as well as the foam-filled ones, exhibited not only a greater specific energy absorption but also presented a lower density. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3D printing;

The samples with high relative density (~ 97–99%) and homogeneous microstructures were successfully fabricated from the pre-alloyed Fe-50%Ni powders with an average particle of 102 μm. Mechanical properties of the printed samples were characterized via uniaxial tensile test, Vickers microhardness, and electron backscatter diffraction. The as-print microstructures contained a single FCC phase with relatively elongated grains in the building direction. The optimum sample which was produced under the highest laser power had the microhardness of ~ 167 HV, ultimate tensile strength of ~ 493 MPa, yield strength value of ~ 315 MPa, and total elongation of ~ 38.7%; thus, it was completely comparable with other Fe-based soft magnetic materials. In the case of all samples, the dislocation activity in the form of substructure development was the predominant deformation mechanism in the as-printed samples. Moreover, the highest saturation magnetization and Curie temperature of 151 emg/g, 477 °C, respectively, were achieved in the sample produced with the highest laser power and energy density; further, the lowest coercivity was 3.16 Oe obtained. The current investigation, thus, showed that a good combination of good mechanical performance and high magnetic properties could be accomplished through the DED process in the Fe-50%Ni soft magnetic permalloy by using the optimum processing condition.

This study aims to investigate the influence of auxetic core topologies on the mechanical characteristics of fully integrated 3D printed polymeric sandwich structures. Specifically, three types of auxetic cores including square node anti-tetra chiral, re-entrant, and arrowhead were investigated and compared with the conventional honeycomb in terms of energy absorption, compressive strength, and Young’s modulus. The specimens were fabricated using FDM 3D printing method and quasi-static compression and low velocity impact loading tests were performed on the printed specimens. Moreover, finite element simulations were conducted to compare with experimental results and deformation patterns as well as for parametric study. Results indicate that the core topology is a critical parameter impressing the mechanical properties of sandwich structures, and using the auxetic cores improved the desirable properties of sandwich structures in both types of loading. Auxetic cores cause the sandwich structure to have more resistance to imported compression, while conventional honeycomb doesn’t have this superiority. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Auxetic core topology;

This work focuses on the quantification of the effect of voids on the impact properties of NCF plates manufactured by LCM. For this purpose, biaxial (0/90) NCF-Epoxy laminates with different void contents were tested by the drop weight impact method. Four LCM variants were used to obtain plates at different void levels: VARTM with controlled modified capillary number (0.58 ± 0.18 %), RTM with controlled modified capillary number (1.35 ± 0.28 %), uncontrolled RTM (2.44 ± 0.14 %), and WCM (4.34 ± 0.31 %). The high void content samples (WCM) recorded a reduction of 25.88% in ultimate fibre failure force Fff, and 9.57% in dissipated energy Edis as compared to the low void content samples (VARTM-Caopt*). Regarding the analysis of damage tolerance, the loss of stiffness after impacts ranging from 2.5 J to 20 J was studied. A slightly higher loss was observed in WCM plates compared to VARTM-Caopt*, the residual stiffness after 20 J impacts being 45.8% and 49.1%, respectively. Therefore, to achieve optimum impact properties it is necessity to develop controlled LCM manufacturing processes that approach zero-defect manufacturing. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Impact properties; Liquid Composite Moulding; Void content","Carbon; Energy dissipation; Laminated composites; Resin transfer molding; Stiffness; Capillary numbers; Carbon-epoxy laminates; Effect of voids; Epoxy laminates; Impact property; Liquid composite moulding; Low impact energy; Non-crimp fabrics; Prepeg materials; Void contents; Capillarity","","","","","Eusko Jaurlaritza, (IT833-16, KK-2017/00062, PRE_2018_1_0338)","The authors acknowledge the valuable help of Dr. Jaime Castro and Dr. Carlos Gonzalez during the characterisation of the contact angle and surface tension of the resin carried out at IMDEA Materials.

This work explores the use of MAPbX3 (MA = CH3NH3, X = Cl, Br, I or mixture of them) perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) by harnessing their unique optical properties for the development of fluorescent 3D printing filaments. Firstly, a one-pot strategy for scalable synthesis of MAPbX3 PQDs-polycaprolactone (PCL) composite was proposed by in situ formation of PQDs in PCL matrix. To demonstrate the ability for the obtained PQDs-PCL composites to fabricate fluorescent filaments, the effects of filament functionalization on optical properties of PQDs, as well as thermal and mechanical properties of polymer matrix were then comprehensively studied. Owing to the good protective capability of PCL, the synthesized PQDs-PCL composites exhibit comparable PLQY and enhanced UV, water and thermal stability compared to that of pure PQDs. Moreover, high concentration of embedded PQDs in PQDs-PCL composites was obtained with decreasing amount of PCL. The aggregation of PQDs at high temperature combined with the poor interaction between PQDs and surrounding PCL matrix led to the decreased thermal transition temperature and reduced mechanical properties in PQDs-PCL composites relative to pure PCL. The glass transition temperature was found to decrease by 5.5 °C, while the mode of failure changed from plastic fracture for pure PCL to brittle fracture for the highest concentration of PQDs in PCL tested. Consequently, PQD-PCL composites were further processed into fluorescent filaments and further fluorescent objects or structures via 3D printing. Green LED and white LED devices were realized by the combination of UV LED chip with 3D printed MAPbBr3 PQD-PCL thin-film, and blue LED chip with MAPbBr3 PQD-PCL thin-film and K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor, respectively, demonstrating that the PQDs-functionalized 3D printing filaments have great potential in fields of optoelectronic application. © 2022","3D printing; Composites; Fluorescent filament; Perovskite quantum dot; Polymer","3D printers; Anisotropy; Binary alloys; Fluorescence; Glass transition; Light emitting diodes; Optical properties; Perovskite; Polymer matrix composites; Semiconductor quantum dots; Temperature; Thin films; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Fluorescent filament; Functionalized polymers; In-situ synthesis; matrix; Perovskite quantum dot; Polymer based; Printed materials; Printed structures; Nanocrystals","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51704225); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; ShanXi Science and Technology Department, (2020JQ-673); ShanXi Science and Technology Department; Shaanxi Science and Technology Association, (20200423); Shaanxi Science and Technology Association","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC Grants 51704225 ); Department of Science and Technology of Shaanxi Province ( 2020JQ-673 ); and Shaanxi Association for Science and Technology ( 20200423 ).

Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical model incorporating manufacturing competitive capabilities and contingency concepts is developed and validated using an empirical study on 105 manufacturing firms using AM. Structural equation modeling is applied for statistical data analysis. Findings: The results indicate that the production volume and material type have contingency effects on AM-enabled product quality, cost reduction and green capabilities. Besides, it has been demonstrated that the degree of a country's economic development and the firm's experience have contingency impacts on AM's capabilities as well. Research limitations/implications: The contextual settings employed in this study are limited. A future contingency analysis requires further exploration of other factors (e.g. different AM technologies or application sectors) through in-depth case studies. Future studies can also be built upon the proposed framework to generalize the model for analyzing other emerging manufacturing technologies. Practical implications: Uncertainties around AM implementation and its consequences place the context of evaluation as an essential facet. The derived insights aid practitioners in aligning the firm's internal characteristics (i.e. manufacturing and organizational contexts) with AM's promising competitive capabilities. Originality/value: The study is among the first analysis to empirically and rigorously establishes the contingency effects of manufacturing and organizational factors on competitive capabilities related to AM, using a representative sample of manufacturers spanning different countries, firm sizes and other investigated manufacturing contexts. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing;

During the formation of three-dimensional(3D) objects by sintering metal powders layer by layer, many different thermal phenomena occur that can create defects or anomalies on the final printed part. Similar to other additive manufacturing techniques, PBF has been in practice for decades, yet it is still going through research and development endeavors which is required to understand the physics behind this process. Defects and deformations highly impact the product quality and reliability of the overall manufacturing process; hence, it is essential that we understand the reason and mechanism of defect generation in PBF process and take appropriate measures to rectify them. In this paper, we have attempted to study the effect of processing parameters (scanning speed, laser power) on the generation of defects in PBF process using a graph-based artificial neural network that uses numerical simulation results as input or training data. Use of graph-based machine learning is novel in the area of manufacturing let alone additive manufacturing or powder bed fusion. The outcome of this study provides an opportunity to design a feedback controlled in-situ online monitoring system in powder bed fusion to reduce printing defects and optimize the manufacturing process. © 2022","defect generation; machine learning; multiscale modeling; online monitoring; powderbed fusion","3D printers; Additives; Deep learning; E-learning; Graphic methods; Industrial research; Metals; Neural networks; Numerical models; Powder metals; Sintering; Defect generation; Fusion process; Graph basis; Graph-based; Machine-learning; Manufacturing process; Multiscale modeling; Online monitoring; Powder bed; Powderbed fusion; Defects","","","","","","","","S.

It is a type of additive manufacturing technique that prints an object layer by layer to create a 3D model. Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) is a 3D printing technology procedure in which the material is heated and extruded layer by layer through a nozzle. When compared to other traditional processes such as injection moulding, 3D printing using the FDM process offers greater versatility. This research provides a methodology for evaluating the mechanical characteristics of various structured FDM polymers. Parametric research is provided to evaluate production aspects such as infill structure, which affect the mechanical performance of PLA and ABS-based specimens. However, understanding the mechanical characteristics of 3D printed structures is inadequate. Experiments were carried out in order to get a better understanding of the design and analysis of various types of 3D printed structures manufactured using the Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) technology. The specimen is designed in Solid Works modelling programme and saved as a Stereolithography file (stl ). QIDI slicing software is used, with the same infill density and orientation. The specimen is sliced with a 40% infill density and a layer height of 0.2 mm. The G-Code file is being created. After slicing, it is produced using an Xmax wol 3D printer using the generated G-Code file. A compression test was done on a square cross section specimen. The test is carried out utilizing a Universal Testing Machine (UTM). Trihexagon, Cubic, Lines, Cubic Subdivision, Gyroid, Triangles, Octet, concentric, cross 3D, and grid are the infill structures employed. This was done to determine which material and infill structure is more durable and has higher compressive strength.  © 2022 Totem Publisher, Inc.","ABS; compressive strength; FDM; infill structure; PLA","","","","","","","","Lay M., Thajudin N.L.N., Hamid Z.A.A., Rusli A., Abdullah M.K., Shuib R.K., Comparison of physical and mechanical properties of PLA, ABS and nylon 6 fabricated using fused deposition modeling and injection molding, Composites Part B: Engineering, 176, (2019); Wang S., Ma Y., Deng Z., Zhang S., Cai J., Effects of fused deposition modeling process parameters on tensile, dynamic mechanical properties of 3D printed polylactic acid materials, Polymer testing, 86, (2020); Grant A., Regez B., Kocak S., Huber J.D., Mooers A., Anisotropic properties of 3-D printed Poly Lactic Acid (PLA) and Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) plastics, Results in Materials, 12, (2021); Xu Z., Fostervold R., Razavi S.M.J., Thickness effect on the mechanical behavior of PLA specimens fabricated via Fused Deposition Modeling, Procedia Structural Integrity, 33, pp. 571-577, (2021); Zhao Y., Chen Y., Zhou Y., Novel mechanical models of tensile strength and elastic property of FDM AM PLA materials: Experimental and theoretical analyses, Materials & Design, 181, (2019); Adi P., Damir, Aleksa M., Effect of infill type and density on tensile properties of PLA material for FDM process DOI:10.2507/ 30th.daaam.proceedings.xxx, INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING AND AUTOMATION, 163, pp. 393-402, (2019); Chalgham A., Ehrmann A., Wickenkamp I., Mechanical properties of FDM printed PLA parts before and after thermal treatment, Polymers, 13, 8, (2021); Vosynek P., Navrat T., Krejbychova A., Palousek D., Influence of process parameters of printing on mechanical properties of plastic parts produced by FDM 3D printing technology, MATEC web of conferences, EDP Sciences, 237, (2018); Baca Lopez D.M., Ahmad R., Tensile mechanical behaviour of multi-polymer sandwich structures via fused deposition modelling, Polymers, 12, 3, (2020); Vinoth Babu N., Venkateshwaran N., Rajini N., Ismail S.O., Mohammad F., Al-Lohedan H.A., Suchart S., Influence of slicing parameters on surface quality and mechanical properties of 3D-printed CF/PLA composites fabricated by FDM technique, Materials Technology, 37, 9, pp. 1008-1025, (2022); Dudescu C., Racz L., Effects of raster orientation, infill rate and infill pattern on the mechanical properties of 3D printed materials, ACTA Univ.

The microstructure and properties of the as-built component were studied. The results show the as-built component consists of NiTi (B2), Cr2Ti, and Ti2Ni phases. In the upper region, Ti2Ni phase is present as nanoparticles mainly embedded in Cr2Ti phase. Cr2Ti phase is present as long oriented strips or granular precipitates. Due to the presence of secondary Cr2Ti and Ti2Ni phases, the hardness of this component is 600–650 HV0.2. The average compression strength is ∼1970 MPa and it exhibits outstanding superelasticity with a recoverable strain of 5.5%. The austenite finish temperature is −62 °C, which indicates that Ni–Ti–Cr–Mo–Nb alloy has the superelasticity at low temperature. © 2022","Fracture behavior; Microstructure; Phase transformation; Shape memory alloy; Wire arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Binary alloys; Chromium alloys; Elasticity; Fabrication; Fracture mechanics; Niobium alloys; Shape-memory alloy; Space research; Temperature; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Wire; Fracture behavior; In-field; Inconel 625; Microstructure and properties; Nb alloys; Phases transformation; Superelasticity; Welding wires; Wire arc; Wire arc additive manufacturing; Microstructure","","","","","Major science and Technology projects in Tianjin, (15ZXQXSY00080); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51871166, U1764254); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City, (19JCZDJC39000); Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number: U1764254]; the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant number: 51871166 ]; Major science and Technology projects in Tianjin [Grant number: 15ZXQXSY00080 ]; and Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin (Grant No. 19JCZDJC39000 ).","Qi Z., Cong B., Qi B., Sun H., Zhao G., Ding J., Microstructure and mechanical properties of double-wire + arc additively manufactured Al-Cu-Mg alloys, J.

It's found that the scanning speed has a significant influence on the microstructure. Moreover, the fractured morphology shows that it is easy to cause cracks at the lower energy density. However, at a higher energy density, it is easy to induce defects such as keyhole induced pores. The appropriate process parameters of additive manufacturing matching the pure tantalum with higher relative density and better mechanical properties have precious value for its application in medicine and industry. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Process parameter; Pure tantalum; Selective laser melting","Density (specific gravity); Melting; Microstructure; Selective laser melting; Surface morphology; Tantalum; Tensile strength; Application requirements; ITS applications; Laser powders; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Performance; Powder bed; Process parameters; Pure tantalum; Scanning speed; Selective laser melting; Morphology","","","","","Capital's Funds for Health Improvement and Research, (CFH 2020-2-5131); Guangdong Regional Joint Foundation, (2020B1515120013); Guangdong Special Support Program for High-level Talents, (2019TQ05Z110); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51875215, 81772428, U2001218); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (2019MS060)","The authors gratefully appreciate the financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China ( U2001218 , 51875215 , 81772428 ), Guangdong Special Support Program for High-level Talents ( 2019TQ05Z110 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( 2019MS060 ), Guangdong Regional Joint Foundation Key Project ( 2020B1515120013 ), Capital's Funds for Health Improvement and Research ( CFH 2020-2-5131 ).","Gladczuk L., Patel A., Paur C.S., Sosnowski M., Tantalum films for protective coatings of steel, Thin Solid Films, 467, pp. 150-157, (2004); Dong C., Bi X.L., Yu J.G., Liu R., Zhang Q.X., Microstructural evolution and sintering kinetics during spark plasma sintering of pure tantalum powder, J.

However, the serious thermal stress induced by the LAM process always causes the harmful cracks to be left inside the Zr-based BMGs with brittleness characteristics, which will lead to a sharp deterioration in fracture toughness. To solve this dilemma, B2 phase with excellent plasticity, realizing work-hardening through martensitic transformation, was precipitated during the cooling process of Zr48Cu46.5Al4Nb1.5 BMG composite (BMGC). The deposited Zr-based BMGCs possess composite structures, i.e., B2 phase is distributed in the partially crystallized glassy matrix. The TRIP effect provided by B2 phase can not only inhibit the generation of cracks, but also effectively avoid premature shearing-off through the sample to greatly improve the fracture strength. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Laser additive manufacturing; Metallic glass composite; Trip effect","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Brittleness; Composite materials; Copper alloys; Cracks; Deterioration; Fracture mechanics; Glass; Martensitic transformations; Metallic glass; Plasticity; Strain hardening; Ternary alloys; Additive manufacturing process; Arbitrary geometry; B2 phase; Bulk metallic glass; Bulk metallic glass composites; Laser additive manufacturing; Metallic glass composites; Stress-induced; TRIP effect; Zr based bulk metallic glass; Fracture toughness","","","","","Joint Research Fund Liaoning-Shenyang National Laboratory for Materials Science, (2019JH3/30100032); State Key Lab of Advanced Metals and Materials, (2021-ZD10); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51971047); project of Liaoning Province, (2020RJ07, XLYC1907046)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 51971047, the project of Liaoning Province's “Rejuvenating Liaoning talents plan” under Grant No. XLYC1907046, Dalian High-Level Talent Innovation Support Program under Grant No. 2020RJ07, Supported by State Key Lab of Advanced Metals and Materials under Grant No. 2021-ZD10, the Joint Research Fund Liaoning-Shenyang National Laboratory for Materials Science under Grant No. 2019JH3/30100032.","Yuan W.U., Liu C.T., Xiao Y., Chen G., Zhaoping L., Adv.

However, there does not seem to be any set methodology for designing these patient-specific instruments. Recent publications using pelvic surgical guides showed various designs with no clearly classified or standardized features. We, thus, developed a systematic digital chain for processing multimodal medical images (CT and MRI), designing customized surgical cutting guides, and manufacturing them using additive manufacturing. The aim of this study is to describe the steps in the conception of surgical cutting guides used in complex oncological bone tumor pelvic resection. We also analyzed the duration of the surgical cutting guide process and tested its ergonomics and usability with orthopedic surgeons using Sawbones models on simulated tumors. The original digital chain made possible a repeatable design of customized tools in short times. Preliminary testing on synthetic bones showed satisfactory results in terms of design usability. The four artificial tumors (Enneking I, Enneking II, Enneking III, and Enneking I+IV) were successfully resected from the Sawbones model using this digital chain with satisfactory ergonomic outcomes. This work validates a new digital chain conception and production of surgical cutting guides. Further works with quantitative margin assessments on anatomical subjects are needed to better assess the design implications of patient-specific surgical cutting guide instruments in pelvic tumor resections.

Recent progress has been made on direct ink writing (DIW) or Digital Light Processing (DLP) to print LCEs with certain actuation. However, it remains a challenge to achieve complicated structures, such as spatial lattices with large actuation, due to the limitation of printing LCEs on the build platform or the previous layer. Herein, a novel method to 4D print freestanding LCEs on-the-fly by using laser-assisted DIW with an actuation strain up to −40% is proposed. This process is further hybridized with the DLP method for optional structural or removable supports to create active 3D architectures in a one-step additive process. Various objects, including hybrid active lattices, active tensegrity, an actuator with tunable stability, and 3D spatial LCE lattices, can be additively fabricated. The combination of DIW-printed functionally freestanding LCEs with the DLP-printed supporting structures thus provides new design freedom and fabrication capability for applications including soft robotics, smart structures, active metamaterials, and smart wearable devices. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","4D printing; hybrid 3D printing; liquid crystal elastomers; multimaterial 3D printing; soft robots","Additives; Elastomers; Liquid crystals; Plastics; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; 4d printing; Hybrid 3d printing; Liquid crystal elastomers; Multi materials; Multimaterial 3d printing; Soft robot; 3D printers","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CMMI‐2142789, CMMI‐2145601, ECCS‐1542174); National Science Foundation, NSF; Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR, (FA 9550‐20‐1‐0306); Air Force Office of Scientific Research, AFOSR; Xerox; Hewlett-Packard Development Company, HP; Northrop Grumman","X.P. and S.W. contributed equally to this work.

The alloy composition of 0.3 wt% Y2O3 – IN718 has been determined using CALPHAD-based thermochemical modeling approach. Designed ODS-IN718 alloy is produced by Selective Laser Melting (SLM) method with various power and velocity values to determine the best process parameters for this system. The SLM parameters are optimized for the production of ODS-IN718 alloy. To dissolve the non-equilibrium phases, which are detrimental to the mechanical properties, and maximize the number densities of nano-oxide and other strengthening phases of γ'/γ″, various heat treatment processes are applied based on the thermochemical calculations. The samples which are solutionized at 1050 °C for 1 h followed by aging at 650 °C for 5 h exhibit the best microstructural and mechanical properties. Tensile tests demonstrate that the strength and ductility of the solutionized and aged samples are much improved compared to the standard solutionized and double aged samples due to the fine and uniform microstructure, especially at elevated temperatures. It is observed that experimental results are consistent with the thermochemical modeling calculations. This clearly shows the promise of thermochemical calculations incorporating various databases for designing new alloy systems with nano-oxide strengthening. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; CALPHAD; FactSage; Inconel 718; Nano-particle; Oxide dispersion strengthened alloy","Additives; Alloying; Dispersions; Heat treatment; Selective laser melting; Tensile testing; Calphad; FactSage; Inconel 718 alloy; Inconel-718; Nano-oxides; Nanoparti-cles; Oxide dispersion strengthened alloys; Selective laser melting; Thermochemical calculations; Thermochemical modeling; Nanoparticles","","","","","Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştirma Kurumu, TÜBITAK, (219M500); Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştirma Kurumu, TÜBITAK","The financial support provided by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) under grant No: 219M500 is greatly acknowledged.

However, Haynes 230 alloy presents a high hot-cracking tendency during the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process. In this study, a novel composition optimized Ni–Cr–W superalloy based on Haynes 230 alloy was fabricated by the LPBF method. The metallurgical defects, microstructure and tensile properties at room temperature (RT) of the LPBF Ni–Cr–W based superalloy printed under different volume energy densities (VEDs) were systematically researched. The results show that the novel Ni–Cr–W superalloy presents excellent processability, and a near-fully dense specimen without any metallurgical defects was obtained under optimal VED of 83.33 J/mm3. However, solidification cracks also occurred in the samples with higher VEDs (exceeding 100 J/mm3). The main reason is the increase of thermal stress and liquid-feeding resistance as VED increases. The rapid scanning speed and steep temperature gradient during the LPBF lead to the occurrence of the multi-scale heterogeneous microstructures, including the epitaxial columnar grains with a mixing of {100} and {110} crystallographic alignment along the building direction (BD) and cellular substructures entangled with high-density dislocation. The cellular substructure strengthening and solution strengthening are the dominant factors for the excellent ultimate tensile strength (1100 MPa), yield strength (850 MPa), and ductility (29.3%) of the LPBF alloy at RT. With the increase of VED, the yield strength of the LPBF alloy decreases. The main reason is the reduction of cellular substructure strengthening. The ultimate tensile strength of the LPBF alloy at 1000 °C reaches 200 MPa, which is superior to that of the LPBF Haynes 230. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Cellular substructure; Heterogeneous microstructure; Laser powder bed fusion; Ni-Cr-W superalloy; Tensile strength","Chromium alloys; Cracks; High strength alloys; High temperature applications; Microstructure; Nickel alloys; Oxidation resistance; Superalloys; Ternary alloys; Tungsten alloys; Yield stress; Cellular sub-structure; Haynes 230 alloy; Heterogeneous microstructure; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Metallurgical defects; Ni-Cr-W; Ni-cr-W superalloy; Powder bed; Volume energy density; Tensile strength","","","","","Northwestern Polytechnical University, NPU","This study was supported by the Analytical & Testing Center of Northwestern Polytechnical University .

The microstructure, precipitation, chemical composition, and their relationship with austenite–martensite transformation temperatures (TTs) and superelastic properties have been extensively investigated in Ni-rich NiTi alloys processed at varying volume energy densities (52–110 J/mm3) through LPBF. A specific amount of Ni3Ti precipitation was observed and primarily located along the boundary and at the center of the melt pool, and nanoscale spherical NiTi2/Ni2Ti4OX precipitation was homogeneously dispersed in the B2 matrix and B19’ martensite, but no Ni4Ti3 was observed as frequently reported in the literature. Decreasing the volume energy density (VED) led to lower TTs and a higher recovery strain ratio. However, there is an exception for the sample built with the highest laser power of 250 W that possesses the largest Ni/Ti atomic ratio and therefore the highest superelastic property despite the mediated VED (∼87 J/mm3) employed. We concluded that the variation in TTs and superelastic properties among the samples is caused by the varying amounts of Ni, which causes competition among alloying elements in evaporation, condensation, and precipitation during LPBF. © 2022","Energy density; Laser powder bed fusion; Ni-rich NiTi alloy; Superelasticity","Alloying elements; Binary alloys; Elasticity; Martensite; Microstructure; Nickel alloys; Precipitation (chemical); Energy density; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Ni-rich niti alloy; NiTi alloys; Powder bed; Super-elastic property; Superelasticity; Temperature properties; Volume energy density; Titanium alloys","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, (ZR2020ME020)","The authors would like to thank the financial support from the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province under Grant No. ZR2020ME020 .","Li X.Q., Chen H., Guo W.M., Guan Y.J., Wang Z.C., Zeng Q.K., Wang X.B., Improved superelastic stability of NiTi shape memory alloys through surface nano-crystallization followed by low temperature aging treatment, Intermetallics, 131, (2021); Alagha A.N., Hussain S., Zaki W., Additive manufacturing of shape memory alloys: a review with emphasis on powder bed systems, Mater.

However, the transition to sustainable manufacturing practices (SMPs) has been disappointing. A framework that explains the process and pathways to guide the transition is lacking. This research adds to our understanding of the transition by building a valid hierarchical model and determining the causal links between sustainable leather processing attributes. This study also investigates the dynamics of sustainability transition attributes in leather tanning and identifies the driving factors in adopting SMPs. The causal attributes for transitioning to sustainable leather processing are highlighted, with recommendations for best practices. In addition, the drivers require qualitative assessment and are subject to uncertainty due to the linguistic preferences of experts. Thus, this study adopts the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) to arrive at a valid set of attributes and the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (FDEMATEL) to address the interrelationships of the proposed attributes. The findings demonstrate that 15 relevant indicators are grouped into five categories, with technical performance and social development as causal factors capable of improving environmental, economic, and regulatory attributes. Therefore, in leather tanning, sociotechnical systems drive the transition to more sustainable alternatives. For decision-makers, the most critical indicators to improve practices are green design, electro-oxidization, regular supervision, site waste management plans, and increasing the level of regulatory compliance. The theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory; Fuzzy delphi method; Leather industry; Sustainability transition; Sustainable manufacturing practices","Economic and social effects; Hierarchical systems; Leather; Planning; Regulatory compliance; Sustainable development; Tanning; Waste management; Ethiopia; Fuzzy Decision making; Fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory; Fuzzy Delphi Method; Leather industries; Manufacturing practices; Social development; Sustainability transition; Sustainable manufacturing; Sustainable manufacturing practice; Decision making","","","","","","","Abdel-Baset M., Chang V., Gamal A., Evaluation of the green supply chain management practices: a novel neutrosophic approach, Comput.

It has been utilized in a variety of research fields and applications. However, little attention has been paid to the nozzle cleanliness issue in the FDM process. Debris of extruded polymer materials can easily build up on the nozzle surface in the printing process and the accumulated debris typically falls on the actual printing area, which degrades the quality of printed parts. This paper innovated an approach to reduce polymer debris build-up on the nozzle during the FDM printing process. An electric-field-assisted FDM (E-FDM) process was proposed to improve the nozzle cleanliness. E-FDM utilizes a high voltage power supply to generate an electrostatic force between the nozzle and build plate, which has great potential to avoid accumulations of melted thermoplastic materials on FDM nozzles. To verify the effectiveness of the E-FDM process, both E-FDM and conventional FDM processes were used to print test specimens for certain durations of time. Debris built up on the nozzle surface was characterized by 3D scanning to quantify the volume changes of the nozzle. The E-FDM printing reduced debris accumulation by 47% after ∼5 hours of printing and over 80% after ∼15 hours of printing as compared to the conventional FDM process. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the electric-field-assisted FDM process in reducing the nozzle debris built up on the nozzle surface. © 2022","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; electric field; fused filament fabrication; nozzle cleanliness","Additives; Debris; Deposition; Electric power systems; Fused Deposition Modeling; Layered manufacturing; Nozzles; Printing presses; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Additive manufacturing process; Fused filament fabrication; Modeling process; Nozzle cleanliness; Nozzle surface; Printing process; Research applications; Research fields; Electric fields","","","","","","","","J.

The influence of the applied laser volumetric energy density (VED) on the laser remelting and premelting behaviors during SLM process are quantitatively investigated. And the SLM experiments were carried out to analyze the metallurgical bonding quality. The relationships are explored among the VED, laser remelting/premelting and metallurgical bonding behavior, thereby revealing the formation and regulation mechanisms of metallurgical bonding. The results show that the laser remelting and premelting contribute to improving the lap ratio of molten tracks and promoting the effective metallurgical bonding. The peak temperature of the remolten pool, remelting and premelting dimensions, remelting and premelting indexes, and lap ratio are positively correlated with the applied VED. Under the optimized VED of 111.1 J/mm3, there is no obvious defect on the cross-section of SLM-fabricated H13 samples, implying a good metallurgical bonding is obtained. This study could provide theoretical and experimental basis for the regulation and control of metallurgical bonding quality of SLM-fabricated parts, which would become design guidelines.

However, the inherently brittle Fe-based BMGs produced by LAM have always been plagued by the micro-cracking induced by the large thermal stresses during the LAM process. To solve this dilemma, 316L stainless steel (SS) with excellent toughness and similar elemental composition was carefully selected as the second phase to form Fe-based BMG composites (BMGCs). The obtained Fe-based BMGCs are equipped with a heterogeneous structure, i.e., the 316L SS phase is wrapped by the metallic glass and forms a unique ""fishbone"" structure with a micron-scale. Excitedly, the special structure nicely improves a plastic strain of the Fe-based BMGC with a strength of 2355 MPa to ∼17%, achieving a record-breaking achievement among Fe-based amorphous with critical dimensions over 1mm. © 2022","Crack free; Laser additive manufacturing; Metallic glass composite; Stainless steel","3D printers; Additives; Cracks; Glass; Metallic glass; Metals; Stainless steel; 316 L stainless steel; Bulk metallic glass; Bulk metallic glass composites; Crack free; Fe-based; Freeform geometry; Laser additive manufacturing; Manufacturing IS; Metallic glass composites; Micro-cracking; Composite materials","","","","","Joint Research Fund Liaoning-Shenyang National Laboratory for Materials Science, (2019JH3/30100032); State Key Lab of Advanced Metals and Materials, (2021-ZD10); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51971047); project of Liaoning Province, (2020RJ07, XLYC1907046)","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51971047 ), the project of Liaoning Province's “Rejuvenating Liaoning talents plan” (No. XLYC1907046 ), Dalian High-Level Talent Innovation Support Program (No. 2020RJ07 ), Supported by State Key Lab of Advanced Metals and Materials (No. 2021-ZD10 ), the Joint Research Fund Liaoning-Shenyang National Laboratory for Materials Science (No. 2019JH3/30100032 ).","Schuh C., Hufnagel T., Ramamurty U., Acta Mater, 55, pp. 4067-4109, (2007); Zhou J., Di S., Sun B., Zeng Q., Shen B., J.

Most of these works focused on the processability, microstructural evolution, post-fabrication treatments and the mechanical behaviour of components manufactured by PBF-LB under static loading. However, limited efforts have been made to investigate the fatigue crack growth (FCG) characteristics of PBF-LB built alloys, thereby imposing a barrier to their use as critical components. As such, the aim of the present study was to evaluate and understand the effect of build orientations (0° and 90°) and post-fabrication treatments (solution heat treatment and hot isostatic pressing) on the FCG behaviour of Hastelloy X (HX) fabricated by PBF-LB process. The results from the FCG tests showed that the build orientations had no discernible influence on the fatigue threshold and FCG rate within near-threshold and Paris regions. Nevertheless, the post-fabrication treatments led to an increase in the fatigue threshold and crack growth resistance within the near-threshold region because of the alleviation of detrimental tensile residual stress alongside the crack growth direction. In conjunction with FCG tests, scanning electron microscopy and electron backscattering diffraction were used to investigate the crack path and fracture surfaces within near-threshold and Paris regions. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Fatigue crack growth rate; Heat treatment; Laser-based powder bed fusion; Microstructure; Nickel-based superalloy","3D printers; Additives; Backscattering; Fabrication; Growth rate; Heat treatment; Hot isostatic pressing; Nickel; Nickel alloys; Scanning electron microscopy; Superalloys; Build orientation; Fatigue crack growth rates; Fatigue-crack-growth tests; Hastelloy X; Laser-based; Laser-based powder bed fusion; Near thresholds; Nickel-based superalloys; Post-fabrication; Powder bed; Fatigue crack propagation","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (379213719); Monash University, MU","The authors greatly appreciate the financial support from Monash University , CSIRO Manufacturing, Guotong AM Tech Co.

The evident prior-β grain boundary, the inside of which is composed of predominant α-lath and slight β-phase, is achieved. The EBF3-manufactured alloy displays a significantly improved corrosion resistance compared to the wrought alloy, especially the XY-plane. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results reveal the formation of a more stable oxide film for the EBF3-manufactured alloy due to a higher fraction of phase boundaries induced by the fine α-laths; besides, the heterogeneous distribution of compositions between α- and β-phases can be effectively alleviated, resulting in the absence of the strong galvanic corrosion, which has been illustrated combined experiments and ab-initio calculations. The electrochemical analyses indicate that all samples exposed to the artificial seawater exhibit a typical spontaneous passive behavior, deriving from the presence of a compact oxide film, while a active–passive transition behavior is observed in 5 M HCl, stemming from the formation of a non-protective porous oxide film, which is well interpreted using the mixed potential theory. In addition, the oxygen reduction reaction, determined by diffusion and charge-transfer processes, is the predominant cathodic reaction in the artificial seawater, whereas, in 5 M HCl, the cathodic reaction is primarily associated with the hydrogen evolution reaction controlled by the discharge step. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Ab-initio calculations; Corrosion behavior; Electrochemical analyses; Electron beam freeform fabrication; Titanium","Aluminum alloys; Aluminum corrosion; Calculations; Charge transfer; Corrosion resistant alloys; Corrosive effects; Electric discharges; Fabrication; Grain boundaries; Microstructure; Niobium alloys; Oxide films; Titanium alloys; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Ab initio calculations; Artificial seawater; Cathodic reactions; Corrosion behaviour; Electrochemical analysis; Electron beam freeform fabrication; Grain-boundaries; Stable oxides; Titania; Wrought alloys; Corrosion resistance","","","","","Major Special Science and Technology Project of Yunnan Province, (202002AB080001-3); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52101037); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2021M690821); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; China Scholarship Council, CSC","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52101037), Major Special Science and Technology Project of Yunnan Province ( 202002AB080001-3 ), and fellowship of China Postdoctoral Science Foundation ( 2021M690821 ).

However, machine and material-based challenges exist, eventually resulting in low-quality end products. When expensive polymers are considered, it is still challenging to tailor their properties and print them for high-quality multifunctional structures. Here, polymer composites of polyetherimide (PEI) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with varying CNT weight fractions are produced in filament form by melt-processing. Neat PEI, 1 wt% and 3 wt% CNTs/PEI are additively manufactured in two different raster orientations (Rectilinear and Concentric), and two most proposed testing geometries, ASTM D638 and D3039. Through effective melt-processing, CNTs-reinforced PEI filaments were achieved, printing parameters and testing protocols were discussed. As a result, ASTM D3039 showed superior coherence with filaments’ mechanical properties. Moreover, based on failure modes, ASTM D3039 provided better compatibility to AM, owing to its simple rectangular form yielding well-adhered layers. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Carbon nanotubes;

Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF), an Additive Manufacturing (AM) technique, is a new technology recently proposed for this purpose. In recent years, a number of studies have been presented to improve the sustainability of the main materials used in 3D printing (e.g. PLA filament), suggesting, in particular, some interesting composite filaments. The present paper is related to the development and characterization of sustainable materials, able to reduce the environmental impacts of the conventional materials for FFF. More specifically, various composite filaments based on polylactic acid (PLA) and different amounts of olive wood scraps were produced by an extrusion process and fully characterized from a physical, thermal and mechanical point of view. As they are suitable for application in a low-cost 3D printing machine, these filaments are used to build simple 3D printed models as a first exploitation of architectural building elements based on wood powder. In addition, in order to evaluate the environmental advantages of the wood waste derived composite filaments, the impact indicators were also quantified by Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). LCA results showed environmental benefits resulting from the inclusion of wood scraps in PLA filaments (20% of wood corresponds to 10% impact reduction) supporting further research in this area. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing (AM); Circular economy; LCA; Olive wood scraps; Requalification","3D printers; Additives; Construction industry; Ecodesign; Environmental impact; Extrusion; Fabrication; Sustainable development; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Additive manufacturing; Built environment; Circular economy; Life cycle assessment; Olive wood; Olive wood scrap; Re-qualification; Wood scrap; Life cycle","","","","","","","Petchwattana N., Channuan W., Naknaen P., Narupai B., 3D printing filaments prepared from modified poly(lactic acid)/teak wood flour composites: an investigation on the particle size effects and silane coupling agent compatibilisation, J.

The results show that the specimen homogenized at 1100 °C for 1 h followed by double-aging treatment exhibited better creep performance than the other two ones homogenized at 1000 °C and 1200 °C. Such enhancement of the creep performance is attributed to fewer crack initiation sites, the higher GB sliding rate near the precipitates at grain boundaries to release stress concentrations, the higher strengthening effect of γ″ phases in grains, and the more effective resistance to cracking by the special GBs than the other specimens. The basic mechanism for the small punch creep of laser powder bed fusion-fabricated Inconel 718 at 650 °C was elucidated by the careful characterization of the microstructures and theoretical calculations. A feasible homogenization strategy for further improving the SPC performance of laser powder bed fusion-fabricated Inconel 718 alloy is to make the specimen have fewer and smaller granular precipitates at GBs, and more tortuous GBs by introducing more special GBs with considering the grain size. Such a key point can be used to determine the appropriate subsequent heat treatment for laser powder bed fusion thin-walled Inconel 718 component. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Crack initiation; Cracking resistance; Homogenization; Inconel 718; Selective laser melting; Small punch creep","Crack initiation; Fabrication; Grain boundaries; Selective laser melting; Thin walled structures; Cracking resistance; Cracks initiations; Creep performance; Homogenization; Homogenization temperatures; Inconel-718; Laser powders; Powder bed; Selective laser melting; Small punch creep; Creep","","","","","Fundamental Research Project of Shenyang National Laboratory for Materials Science, (L2019R18); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51771207, 52171128); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC , Grant Nos. 52171128 and 51771207 ), and the Fundamental Research Project of Shenyang National Laboratory for Materials Science (No. L2019R18 ).","Hosseini E., Popovich V.A., A review of mechanical properties of additively manufactured Inconel 718, Addit.

Fe:Mn powders using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Both the Mn content (18.9–15.1 wt% Mn) and density (7920–7730 kg/m3) of the LPBFed samples decreased slightly with increasing laser scanning speed, while the oxygen content increased (0.12–0.40 wt%). Increasing scanning speed also led to increased porosity (from 0.27% to 2.5%) and increased cracking. The specimen produced at the lowest scanning speed of 600 mm/s, which consisted of only the HCP ε-martensite phase, showed by far the highest yield strength (YS) at 644 MPa and the highest ultimate tensile strength (UTS) at 857 MPa, but the lowest elongation to failure (El) of only 13.7%. Specimens produced at higher scanning rates consisted of both BCC α′-martensite and ε-martensite phases. The sample fabricated at a scanning speed of 700 mm/s showed the best balance of mechanical properties with a YS of 330 MPa, a UTS of 839 MPa, and an El of 36.1%. Electrochemical testing showed corrosion rates from 0.09 mm/yr (600 mm/s specimen) to 0.22 mm/yr (700 mm/s specimen), which are higher than those of both pure Fe and most Fe–30Mn and Fe–35Mn alloys reported in the literature. The work demonstrates that the meso-/micro-scale structure, and, hence, the mechanical properties and corrosion rates of Fe–Mn alloys can be tailored by varying the scanning speed during LPBF processing. It also demonstrates the potential of LPBFed Fe–Mn alloys with low Mn content for use as biodegradable bone substitutes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Biodegradable alloys; Corrosion rate; Fe–Mn alloy; Laser powder bed fusion; Strength-ductility combination","Corrosive effects; Electrochemical corrosion; Manganese alloys; Martensite; Microstructure; Scanning; Speed; Tensile strength; Biodegradable alloys; Corrosion behaviour; Fe - mn-alloys; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Microstructure mechanical properties; Mn content; Powder bed; Scanning speed; Strength-ductility combination; Corrosion rate","","","","","Sinoma Institute of Materials Research; Key Project of Research and Development Plan of Hunan Province, (2022SK2006); Key Project of Research and Development Plan of Hunan Province","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Key Project of Research and Development Plan of Hunan Province (Grant No. 2022SK2006 ).

In the present work, FGMs of stainless steel 308 L and Inconel 625, with continuous change in composition, were fabricated by dual-wire arc additive manufacturing (D-WAAM) by changing the speeds of dual wires in each single layer. The chemical composition, microstructure, phases, and mechanical properties of the FGM were investigated. The results showed that the composition gradient was smoothly distributed along the torch-travelling direction in each single layer, and the composition at the same position along the building direction was stable. With the increase in the content of Inconel 625, the austenite dendrites, which was the main microstructure, became finer first and then coarser, but there was no apparent abrupt change in microstructure in the gradient zone, which made the mechanical properties also show a smooth change. The mechanical properties were weak when the content of Inconel 625 was within 10–50 wt% due to the secondary phases (MC, Laves) distributed at the grain boundary. The proposed fabrication approach of FGM also showed advantages and flexibility in the design of gradient path, or the design of structure size if there is a requirement on the size in the building direction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Continuous change in composition; Dual-wire arc additive manufacturing; Functionally graded material; Mechanical properties; Microstructure","3D printers; Additives; Beams and girders; Fabrication; Grain boundaries; Microstructure; Stainless steel; Wire; Additive manufacturing technology; Chemical compositions; Composition gradient; Continuous change in composition; Dual-wire arc additive manufacturing; Fabrication and characterizations; In compositions; Inconel 625; Single layer; Wire arc; Functionally graded materials","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52174369)","This work is funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.: 52174369 ).","Yan L., Chen Y., Liou F., Additive manufacturing of functionally graded metallic materials using laser metal deposition, Addit.

The microstructure and compressive response of Hastelloy X Ni-based superalloy honeycomb lattiaces fabricated by laser powder-bed fusion additive manufacturing is evaluated. The microstructural studies indicated that the as-built sample consisted of submicron cells with random orientations embedded in columnar austenite grains. The STEM-EDS observations revealed that the cell walls contained dense dislocation tangles rich in Mo and Cr elements compared to the cell interior. After the heat treatment at 1175 °C for 2 h, the partial recrystallization via twinning-assisted nucleation mechanism replaced some columnar grains with equiaxed ones. In addition, EBSD investigations illustrated that the recrystallized grains retained the texture of the parent grains, leading to the reduction of recrystallization kinetics through the creation of low-mobility boundaries. Upon the compression testing, the honeycomb samples showed stretch-dominated type behavior. The fractography results indicated that the initiation of cracks from the outer and inner surfaces of the honeycomb's walls was the failure mechanism of both as-built and heat trated honeycomb samples. Moreover, the compressive performance of the samples was slightly improved after heat treatment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Compressive performance; Honeycomb structure; Laser powder-bed fusion; Ni-based superalloy; Recrystallization","3D printers; Additives; Compression testing; Fabrication; Failure (mechanical); Fracture mechanics; Nickel alloys; Recrystallization (metallurgy); Superalloys; Textures; Walls (structural partitions); Compression properties; Compressive performance; Hastelloy X; Laser powder-bed fusion; Laser powders; Manufacturing IS; Microstructures properties; Ni-based superalloys; Powder bed; Recrystallisation; Honeycomb structures","","","","","Iran National Science Foundation, INSF, (97024861); Iran National Science Foundation, INSF","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Iran National Science Foundation: INSF (Grant No. 97024861 ).

The effect of heat treatment on the anisotropic microstructure and the small punch creep (SPC) property of Inconel 718 samples was investigated. The experimental results show that the general high-angle grain boundaries with stress concentration, and the equiaxed and columnar grains are observed in the HT1 samples. Compared with the traditional solution treatment at 1065 °C for the HT1 samples, a higher solution performed at 1150 °C can efficiently eliminate the stress concentration and lead to the transformation of columnar grains to equiaxed grains in the HT2 samples by introducing complete recrystallization. The recrystallization is accompanied by the formation of annealing twins with high proportion Σ3n (n = 1, 2, 3) twin boundaries. The larger γ″ phases, less grain boundaries perpendicular to the load direction and smaller Laves phases in the HT1-Z (Z represents parallel to the building direction) sample result in a longer creep life. Microcracks distributed along the general high-angle grain boundaries rather than twin boundaries promote the final intergranular fracture. The anisotropy in creep rupture time of SLMed Inconel 718 alloy can be obviously alleviated by applying higher temperature solution treatment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Heat treatment; Inconel 718; Microstructure; Selective laser melting; Small punch creep","Anisotropy; Grain boundaries; Melting; Microcracks; Recrystallization (metallurgy); Selective laser melting; Stress concentration; Textures; Columnar grain; Creep properties; Effect of heat treatments; Equi-axed grains; High angle grain boundaries; Inconel 718 alloy; Inconel-718; Recrystallisation; Selective laser melting; Small punch creep; Creep","","","","","Siemens Ltd; Siemens Ltd.; Steel Group Co.

The 3D-printed parts can be scaled, individualized, embedded, and combined into multi-functional structures without modifications to the fabrication technology. This manuscript reports the first demonstration of monolithically 3D-printed stacked dielectric actuators (SDEAs) in a single fabrication process utilizing a commercially accessible extrusion 3D printer and thermoplastic filaments. Neither single-layer nor stacked dielectric actuators have been 3D printed with thermoplastic filament extrusion in a single process until now. To achieve single-process fabrication, this research successfully addresses the main challenges: single-process fabrication of the dielectric layer and electrodes, repeatability and reliability of the 3D-printed thin dielectric layer, and layer stacking. Four actuators with different active areas and a number of stacked active layers were 3D printed. The functionality of the 3D-printed actuators was demonstrated with dynamic electromechanical characterization in a free-displacement and blocked-force configuration in a broad frequency range (up to 5 kHz). The actuators show promise for applications that require high-frequency resonators or high controllability in the sub-resonance region. © 2022 The Author(s)","Blocked force characterization; Dielectric actuator;

Typically, for nickel-based alloys such as Alloy 625, argon gas is used during the atomization process. Considering the larger environmental impact of argon gas compared to nitrogen gas, and the increasing use of gas atomized metal powders, the environmental impact of powder based additive manufacturing techniques could be mitigated if gas atomization of alloys such as Alloy 625 using nitrogen was possible. This work investigates the feasibility of tailoring an alloy to allow atomization using nitrogen gas while remaining within the Alloy 625 specification. This is achieved by limiting the nitrogen pick-up during the atomization process, primarily by reducing the titanium content. The metallurgical implications of this tailored alloy and the subsequent atomization using nitrogen, as well as the attained microstructure from the Powder Bed Fusion – Laser Beam process is investigated and compared to a more common 625 alloy composition which was atomized using argon. Furthermore, the microstructural development of the alloys after heat treatments are evaluated. Lastly corrosive properties, as well as tensile and impact properties are evaluated both in the as-built and hot isostatic pressed condition. © 2022 The Authors","Alloy 625; Alloying for AM; Atomization gases; Corrosion; PBF-LB; Tensile and impact testing","3D printers; Additives; Environmental impact; Gases; Heat treatment; Laser beams; Metals; Nickel alloys; Powder metals; Tensile testing; Alloy 625; Alloying for AM; Argon gas; Atomization gas; Atomization process; Fusion lasers; Nitrogen gas; PBF-LB; Powder bed; Powder-based; Corrosion","","","","","Stiftelsen för Strategisk Forskning, SSF, (GMT14-048); Vetenskapsrådet, VR, (2016-05460)","The authors acknowledge the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF) project GMT14-048 (Additive Manufacturing – Development of Process and Materials).

The dynamic behavior of the melt pool may cause various quality issues. However, laser-based PBF (e.g., selective laser melting) is a volatile process, which makes in-situ process monitoring very difficult. This study uses in-situ high-speed coaxial pyrometry to real-time capture emission of the dynamic melt pool at the track, layer, and part levels in SLM of SS 316L powders. Emission readings have been characterized and correlated with thermal histories at different levels. The results have shown that the relationship between emissions and temperature can be used to establish pyrometry as a process signature for overheating in an SLM process. © 2022","data analytics; powder bed fusion; process monitoring; pyrometry; thermal history","Data Analytics; Process control; Data analytics; Fusion process; Laser-based; Melt pool; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion; Rapid-heating; Real- time; Thermal; Thermal history; Process monitoring","","","","","","","","","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","22138463","","","","English","Manuf.

The microscopic characteristics show that the grains are transformed into equiaxed grains after different HIP + HT. The precipitates of M23C6 carbide are distributed in grains and grains boundaries. The number of precipitates in grains decreased during the increase of the temperature of the heat treatment. The results of nano-indentation experiments show that the average elastic modulus first increases and decreases with the growth of heat treatment temperature, and the average hardness fluctuates significantly in increasing the temperature of post-treatment. When the heat treatment temperature reaches the maximum value, the minimum value of average hardness is obtained of 2.46 GPa. The Vickers hardness decreases from 204HV0.5 to 188HV0.5 with the increase of heat treatment temperature. According to tensile tests, a good combination of strength and plastic properties of SLM-Hastelloy X alloy after HIP + HT treatment is obtained except for HIP+1150 °C/h. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","EBSD; Hardness; Hastelloy X; Nano-indentation; Precipitates; SLM; TEM","Carbides; Indentation; Sintering; Tensile testing; Textures; Vickers hardness; EBSD; Hastelloy X; Heat treatment temperature; Hot-isostatic pressings; Microscopic characteristics; Microstructure and properties; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Nano indentation; SLM; TEM; Hot isostatic pressing","","","","","Nature Science Foundation of Shaanxi, (2021JQ-286); Chang'an University, CHD, (300102311403); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","The authors are very grateful for the support received from the Nature Science Foundation of Shaanxi (NO. 2021JQ-286 ), and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, CHD (No. 300102311403 ).","Mumtaz K.A., Erasenthiran P., Hopkinson N., High density selective laser melting of Waspaloy®, J.

However, it is severely impeded by the constant body temperature, shortage of Fe(Ⅱ) ions and insufficient H2O2 level in infected tissue. To enhance the therapeutic efficiency of CDT, improved strategies are urgently needed to tackle these problems. Herein, we exploited an infection microenvironment-responsive nanotherapeutics for near-infrared (NIR)/dihydroartemisinin (DHA) dual-augmented antibacterial CDT. The convenient encapsulation of DHA-loaded α-Fe2O3 nanorods with metal-polyphenol networks (MPN) led to the generation of an antibacterial nanoagent Fe2O3@DHA@MPN (FDM). Afterwards, its photothermal and peroxidase-like activities were intensively studied. Furthermore, the bactericidal efficacy of FDM was evaluated through both in vitro and in vivo antibacterial assays. Firstly, FDM showed both satisfactory photothermal and NIR/DHA dual-augmented peroxidase-like activities. Besides, it exhibited a pH-responsive release behavior of both Fe(Ⅱ) ions and DHA. Moreover, it presented tannic acid-mediated bacterial adhesion effect. In vitro experiments demonstrated that FDM could achieve a satisfactory efficiency against both planktonic bacteria and biofilms. In vivo assays illustrated both the extraordinary synergistic antibacterial effect and efficient anti-inflammatory ability of FDM. The outcomes indicated that the exploited antibacterial agent could offer new insight on developing intelligent nanotherapeutics for clinical use in the future. Statement of significance: The antibacterial efficiency of chemodynamic therapy (CDT) is seriously limited by the constant body temperature, shortage of Fe(Ⅱ) ions and insufficient H2O2 level at the mildly acidic inflammatory microenvironment. To address these issues, we have developed a pH-responsive nanoagent (Fe2O3@DHA@MPN) for near-infrared (NIR)/dihydroartemisinin (DHA) dual-augmented CDT. Through the NIR-induced photothermal effect of exterior Fe(Ⅲ)/tannic acid complex, the increased local temperature led to a photothermal enhanced CDT. Besides, a continuous supply of Fe(Ⅱ) ions could be achieved by tannic acid-mediated Fe(Ⅲ) reduction. Moreover, DHA was adopted as a substitute for H2O2 to initiate DHA-mediated CDT. Both in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated its outstanding bactericidal efficiency. Therefore, the developed nanotherapeutics could be a promising candidate for clinical trials. © 2022","Antibacterial therapy; Chemodynamic therapy; Dihydroartemisinin; Photothermal effect; α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanorods","Anti-Bacterial Agents; Artemisinins; Cell Line, Tumor; Ferric Compounds; Ferrous Compounds; Hydrogen Peroxide; Nanoparticles; Peroxidases; Tannins; Bacteria; Efficiency; Flavonoids; Hematite; Infrared devices; Ions; Metabolism; Physiology; Tannins; dihydroartemisinin; ferric oxide; antiinfective agent; artemisinin derivative; dihydroartemisinin; ferric ion; ferrous ion; hydrogen peroxide; nanoparticle; peroxidase; tannin derivative; Antibacterial therapy; Antibacterials; Chemodynamic therapy; Chemodynamics; Dihydroartemisinin; Near Infrared; Near-infrared; Photothermal effects; Polyphenols; Α-fe2O3 nanorod; antibacterial activity; antibiotic therapy; Article; bacterial infection; bacterium adherence; body temperature; clinical outcome; enzyme activity; in vitro study; in vivo study; infrared radiation; nonhuman; pH; tumor cell line; Nanorods","","dihydroartemisinin, 71939-50-9, 81496-81-3; ferric oxide, 1309-37-1, 56449-54-8; ferric ion, 20074-52-6; ferrous ion, 15438-31-0; hydrogen peroxide, 7722-84-1; peroxidase, 9003-99-0; Anti-Bacterial Agents, ; Artemisinins, ; artenimol, ; Ferric Compounds, ; Ferrous Compounds, ; Hydrogen Peroxide, ; Peroxidases, ; Tannins, ","","","Discipline Construction Project of Guangdong Medical University, (4SG22002G); Innovation and Entrepreneurship Team Leads the Pilot Program of Zhanjiang, (2020LHJH005); Public Service Platform of South China Sea for R&D Marine Biomedicine Resources, (2017C8A); Zhanjiang Science and Technology Development Special Fund Project, (2020A04005); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51903060); Guangdong Province Higher Vocational Colleges and Schools Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2019B1515120006, 2020A1515011244)","This research was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 51903060 ), Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2020A1515011244, 2019B1515120006), Guangdong Province Universities and Colleges Pearl River Scholar Funded Scheme (2019), Innovation and Entrepreneurship Team Leads the Pilot Program of Zhanjiang (2020LHJH005), Zhanjiang Science and Technology Development Special Fund Project (2020A04005) the Public Service Platform of South China Sea for R&D Marine Biomedicine Resources (2017C8A), Discipline Construction Project of Guangdong Medical University (No. 4SG22002G).

In this paper, the effectiveness of applying DED to the design and synthesis of model CoCrFeNiTi high entropy alloys (HEAs) was demonstrated. Through a careful design of composition and delicate selection of particle size and shape, three CoCrFeNiTi HEAs with different microstructures were in-situ synthesized from premixed elemental powders. Transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction were used for microstructure characterization. H3-Co24.4Cr17.4Fe17.5Ni24.2Ti16.5 in at% (close to Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti) was fabricated with a soft face-centered cubic (FCC)-γ phase structure while hard intermetallic phases such as σ-FeCr, δ-NiTi2, and a small amount of Ni3Ti2 were precipitated and uniformed distributed in the FCC matrix for H1-Co22.2Cr16.1Fe19Ni21.8Ti20.9 and H2-Co25.9Cr15Fe17Ni20.8Ti21.3. With a large percent of the secondary phases, H1 exhibited a hardness value of about 853 HV0.5. These HEAs displayed a high oxidation resistance comparable to Inconel 625 superalloy. A detailed evaluation of the composition, microstructure, hardness, oxidation resistance, and wear resistance of these HEAs was conducted as compared with those of a reference HEA and two popular wear-resistant steels. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Hardness; High entropy alloys; Microstructure; Oxidation resistance","3D printers; Additives; Binary alloys; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Cost effectiveness; Deposition; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Entropy; Hardness; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Microstructure; Particle size; Scanning electron microscopy; Wear of materials; Wear resistance; Additive manufacturing process; Cost effective; Directed energy; Elemental powder mixture; Energy depositions; Face-centred cubic; High entropy alloys; High-throughput synthesis; Material development; Scale-up; High-entropy alloys","","","","","","","Gokuldoss P.K., Kolla S., Eckert J., Additive manufacturing processes: selective laser melting, electron beam melting and binder jetting-selection guidelines, Materials, 10, 6, (2017); Qiu C., Kindi M.A., Aladawi A.S., Hatmi I.A., A comprehensive study on microstructure and tensile behaviour of a selectively laser melted stainless steel, Sci.

Traditional manufacturing processes have limited the design and performance of flow distributors and mixers. However, the maturing of additive manufacturing (AM) has increased the range of manufacturable geometries, enabling the construction of novel high-performance flow distribution devices. An additively manufactured fractal flow mixer was designed using the concept of self-similar bifurcating channels that symmetrically bifurcates a flow into multiple channels, achieving flow uniformity through a series of sequential stages. After four stages of bifurcation, a y-junction on each channel was introduced before the outlet, mixing the flow from two modules. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were carried out to characterise the hydrodynamics and mixing performance of the newly designed mixer over a range of operating conditions and for mixing two gases. Effect of inlet Reynolds numbers (Re) and flow ratio was studied, the maximum relative standard deviation (RSD) was found to be ∼8%, and majority of the flow was uniformly mixed with a distribution index close to unity. The fractal flow mixer was successfully manufactured using vat photopolymerisation (VP) and laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) techniques without any supports. © 2022","CFD; Flow distribution; Flow mixing; Fractal; Laser powder bed fusion; Selective laser melting","3D printers; Additives; Bifurcation (mathematics); Computational fluid dynamics; Flow control; Mixers (machinery); Mixing; Reynolds number; Flow distribution; Flow-mixing; Fractal flows; Functional requirement; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Performance; Powder bed; Selective laser melting; Uniform distribution; Fractals","","","","","Australian Government; Australian Research Council, ARC, (LP160101181); Australian Research Council, ARC; Government of Western Australia, WA Government; Woodside","We would like to thank Woodside Energy Limited ( www.woodside.com.au ) and the Australian Research Council for funding the project (Project ID: LP160101181).

In addition, their machinability and weldability performance make alloy steels suitable for a range of manufacturing operations. The advent of additive manufacturing technologies, such as wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM), has enabled welding of alloy steels into complex and customized near net-shape products. However, the functional reliability of as-built WAAM products is often uncertain due to a lack of understanding of the effects of process parameters on the material microstructure and mechanical properties that develop during welding, primarily driven by thermal phenomena. This study investigated the influence of thermal phenomena in WAAM on the microstructure and mechanical properties of two alloy steels (G4Si1, a mild steel, and AM70, a high-strength, low-alloy steel). The interrelationships between process parameters, heating and cooling cycles of the welded part, and the resultant microstructure and mechanical properties were characterized. The welded part experienced multiple reheating cycles, a consequence of the layer-by-layer manufacturing approach. Thus, high temperature gradients at the start of the weld formed fine grain structure, while coarser grains were formed as the height of the part increases and the temperature gradient decreased. Microstructural analysis identified the presence of acicular ferrite and equiaxed ferrite structures in G4Si1 welds, as well as a small volume fraction of pearlite along the ferrite grain boundaries. Analysis of AM70 welds found acicular ferrite, martensite, and bainite structures. Mechanical testing for both materials found that the hardness of the material decreased with the increase in the height of the welded part as a result of the decrease in the temperature gradient and cooling rate. In addition, higher hardness and yield strength, and lower elongation at failure was observed for parts printed using process parameters with lower energy input. The findings from this work can support automated process parameter tuning to control thermal phenomena during welding and, in turn, control the microstructure and mechanical properties of printed parts. © 2022 The Authors","Mechanical properties; Microstructure characterization; Steels; Wire and arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Ferrite; Grain boundaries; Hardness; High strength alloys; Mechanical testing; Specifications; Textures; Welding; Wire; Acicular ferrite; Microstructure characterization; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Process parameters; Strength property; Thermal influence; Thermal phenomenon; Toughness properties; Weld microstructures; Wire and arc additive manufacturing; Welds","","","","","Jaakko Kotiranta and Merja Ritola; Tampereen Yliopisto, UTA","The authors acknowledge the support from Jaakko Kotiranta and Merja Ritola from the Automation Technology and Mechanical Engineering Lab at Tampere University for their assistance in the machining and preparation of metallographic and mechanical specimens for material testing.","Standard Guide for Directed Energy Deposition of Metals, (2016); Ding D., Pan Z., Cuiuri D., Li H., Wire-feed additive manufacturing of metal components: technologies, developments and future interests, Int.

Filaments were processed using a thermokinetic mixer and then processed by a mini extruder using different fiber loadings (5, 10, 15, and 20% wt.). The effect of the fiber contents on the morphological, chemical, and thermal properties was evaluated, and environmental analysis was performed using the life cycle assessment. For a concept-proof, the materials were printed using a 3D printing pen. Pristine ABS presented no porosity, while filament composites showed a porous structure due to fiber presence and higher fiber loading induced pores with a diameter smaller than 50 μm. ABS and filament composites presented similar FTIR spectra; however, the hydrogen-bonding coefficient indicated a better fiber-matrix interaction for the ABS/15%Palm composition, increasing 42% compared to ABS. Filament's composites presented a slight decrease in thermal stability, which does not compromise its processing temperature, while the Tg presented similar values to pristine ABS. The life cycle assessment demonstrated beneficial environmental gains with fiber inclusion, especially for agricultural land occupation and ozone depletion impact categories. The filaments were successfully printed using a 3D printing pen showing the viability of using the developed filaments, and new applications may be promoted. Thus, the revalorization of palm fibers in the ABS matrix presents a low-cost alternative for filaments production and may expand 3D printing applications with more sustainable materials that could enable new applications in the additive manufacturing area. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3D printing; ABS; Filament composite; Palm residue","3D printers; Butadiene; Chemical analysis; Fibers; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Life cycle; Porosity; Styrene; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene; Fiber loadings; Filament composites; matrix; New applications; Palm residue; Revalorization; Thermokinetics; Reinforcement","","","","","REVALORES; Universidade Federal do ABC, UFABC; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2020/13703–3, 2021/08296–2); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (305819/2017–8); Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, FAPERJ, (E-26/010.001800/2015, E-26/010.101232/2018)","Funding text 1: This research was funded by Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (E-26/010.101232/2018 and E-26/010.001800/2015) (Brazil), the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) (2020/13703–3 and 2021/08296–2) (Brazil), and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (305819/2017–8) (Brazil).

However, the influences of the different post heat treatments on the SLM Al–Mg-Sc-Zr alloys have not been systematically investigated. Hence, the SLM Al–Mg-Sc-Zr alloys were post-treated by a series of different heat treatments to investigate their influences on the SLM Al–Mg-Sc-Zr alloy, including the phase transitions, microstructural evolutions, and mechanical properties. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to study the emergence and effects of Al3(Sc,Zr) precipitates. Strengthening mechanisms of the different heat-treated samples were recognized and calculated in details based on the observations of cubic primary Al3(Sc,Zr) particles and spherical secondary Al3(Sc,Zr) precipitates behavior. Benefiting from the grain boundary strengthening and precipitation dispersion strengthening mechanisms, ultimate tensile strength of the aged samples increased from 353.7 MPa to 528.0 MPa. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Al–Mg-Sc-Zr alloy; Heat treatment regime; Mechanical properties; Precipitation behavior; Selective laser melting","Atom lasers; Grain boundaries; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Precipitation (chemical); Scanning electron microscopy; Tensile strength; Zircaloy; Al–mg-sc-zr alloy; Effect of solutes; Heat treatment regime; Post heat-treatment; Precipitation behaviour; Re-dissolution; Selective laser melting; Solute atoms; Strength and ductilities; Strengthening mechanisms; Heat treatment","","","","","Guangdong Special Support Program, (2019BT02C629, 2022GDASZH-2022010107); Hunan Province Innovation Platform and Talent Plan Project, (2015RS4001); International cooperation platform of Science and Technology; Sciences Platform Environment and Capacity Building Projects of GDAS, (2021GDASYL-20210102005); China Association for Science and Technology, CAST, (YESS20210269); China Association for Science and Technology, CAST; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (2015QNRC001, 51601229); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2016JJ3151, 2020JJ4114); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province; Guangdong Academy of Sciences, GDAS, (2022GDASZH-2022010203-003); Guangdong Academy of Sciences, GDAS; Open-End Fund for the Valuable and Precision Instruments of Central South University, (CSUZC201815); Open-End Fund for the Valuable and Precision Instruments of Central South University; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2020A1515111031, 2021A1515010939); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","This work was supported by the Sciences Platform Environment and Capacity Building Projects of GDAS ( 2021GDASYL-20210102005 ), the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Fund ( 2020A1515111031 , 2021A1515010939 ), the Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by China Association for Science and Technology (CAST) ( YESS20210269 ), the Guangdong Special Support Program ( 2019BT02C629 ), the GDAS′ Project of Science and Technology Development ( 2022GDASZH-2022010107 ), the International cooperation platform of Science and Technology, Guangdong Academy of Sciences ( 2022GDASZH-2022010203-003 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (Grant Nos. 2020JJ4114 , 2016JJ3151 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51601229 ), the Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by CAST (Grant No. 2015QNRC001 ), the Hunan Province Innovation Platform and Talent Plan Project ( 2015RS4001 ) and the Open-End Fund for the Valuable and Precision Instruments of Central South University ( CSUZC201815 ).","Aboulkhair N.T., Simonelli M., Parry L., Ashcroft I., Tuck C., Hague R., 3D printing of Aluminium alloys: additive Manufacturing of Aluminium alloys using selective laser melting, Prog.

Due to a high temporal and spatial resolution in this method, a vast volume of data are generated and collected, leading to a challenge for data processing and analysis. In this study, we present an accurate, robust, and powerful image analytical approach that can identify the high-fidelity automated features and extract important information from X-ray images. In total, we train six semantic segmentation models and six object detection models using 628 X-ray images obtained from two recent literature. Our study demonstrates that the U net + MobileNet model is the overall best choice among 12 models to recognize and extract desired regions, in terms of accuracy, time consumption, and dataset sensitivity. Using this model, we have collected and summarized geometric features and dynamic behaviors of the keyholes and generated bubbles. The image segmentation approach may pave the path for unveiling new mechanisms that might not be easily identified using conventional analysis methods in additive manufacturing processes. © 2022, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.","Dynamic behaviors; Geometric features; Image segmentation; Laser powder bed fusion; Machine learning","3D printers; Additives; Data handling; Data mining; Deep learning; Defects; Learning systems; Object detection; Semantic Segmentation; Defect analysis; Dynamic behaviors; Geometric feature; Images segmentations; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Machine-learning; Powder bed; X rays photography; X-ray image; Semantics","","","","","Centre for Analytics and Artificial Intelligence Engineering; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (RGPIN-2018-05731); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; New Frontiers in Research Fund-Exploration, (ALLRP 570708-2021, NFRFE-2019-00603)","We greatly acknowledge the financial support from Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC Discovery Grant # RGPIN-2018-05731), the Centre for Analytics and Artificial Intelligence Engineering (CARTE) Seed Funding program, New Frontiers in Research Fund-Exploration (NFRFE-2019-00603), Data Sciences Institute Catalyst Grant, and NSERC Alliance Grants\u2014Missions ALLRP 570708-2021.

Here we explore the influence of a wide range of major build parameters on microstructures and mechanical properties of 718 Ni alloys. Volumetric energy density appears to be one of the major parameters that captures the relationship between energy input and measured mechanical properties and microstructures of the alloys. A threshold energy density was identified below which the properties of the additively manufactured specimen degrade substantially. The influence of energy density on the quality of the built specimen simulated using Flow3D AM correlates well with the experimental results. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Electron microscopy; Energy density; Interfaces; Mechanical properties; Nickel alloys","3D printers; Additives; Density (specific gravity); Electron microscopy; Microstructure; Build Parameters; Complex geometries; Energy density; Energy inputs; Mechanical; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Ni alloys; Ni-based superalloys; Properties and microstructures; Volumetric energy densities; Nickel alloys","","","","","Proto Precision Additive LLC; Purdue University, PU; Nuclear Energy University Program, NEUP, (DE-NE0008990); Nuclear Energy University Program, NEUP","Funding text 1: Stegman and Zhang would like to acknowledge the partial financial support from the DOE Nuclear Energy University Program (NEUP) under grant number DE-NE0008990.

The process parameters of SLM determine the quality of as-built parts, but it is difficult to establish an accurate and reliable mathematical model to connect process parameters with the quality of as-built parts. However, data-driven machine learning can effectively solve the analysis and prediction problem of complex process. Therefore, a machine learning (ML) prediction method based on dimensionality augmentation and physical information is proposed, which connects the process parameters (laser power, hatching space, scanning speed, and layer thickness) of SLM with the quality characteristics (top layer surface roughness and relative density) of as-built parts. The four process parameter features (4-dimensional features) are expanded to high-dimensional features through feature engineering to characterize the quality of as-built parts. In addition, the physical information of powder melting forming in SLM process is fused with ML algorithm, the theory-guided ML is used to improve the prediction accuracy of the model. In this paper, the CoCrFeNiMn high-entropy alloy as-built samples dataset is used for network training of four ML algorithms, and three assessment indexes are used to evaluate the prediction model. The results show that dimensionally augmented and physics-informed ML model has better prediction accuracy and generalization ability. The proposed method can also provide guidance for optimizing process parameters. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Dimensionality augmentation; Machine learning; Physical information; Quality characteristics prediction","Additives; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Complex networks; Entropy; High-entropy alloys; Iron alloys; Machine learning; Manganese alloys; Melting; Selective laser melting; Surface roughness; Dimensionality augmentation; High entropy alloys; Machine learning algorithms; Physical information; Prediction accuracy; Process parameters; Quality characteristic; Quality characteristic prediction; Quality prediction; Selective laser melting; Forecasting","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai in China, (20ZR1414000); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52175140); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM, (19110712500); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM; Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities of the Central South University","This research work is sponsored by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52175140 ), International Collaboration Program from Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality in China (No. 19110712500 ), Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai in China (No. 20ZR1414000 ), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China.

Hydroxyapatite (HA), a major component of natural bone, has been extensively recognized as an osteoconductive biomolecule. Here, inspired by the mussel-adhesive phenomenon, in this study, polydopamine (PDA) coating was applied to the surface of 3D printed PLA scaffolds (PLA@PDA), acting as a versatile adhesive platform for immobilizing HA nanoparticles (nHA). Comprehensive analyses were performed to understand the physicochemical properties of the 3D-printed PLA scaffold functionalized with nHA and PDA for their potent clinical application as a bone regenerative substitute. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and element dispersive X-ray (EDX) confirmed a successful loading of nHA particles on the surface of PLA@PDA after 3 and 7 days of coating (PLA@PDA-HA3 and PLA@PDA-HA7), while the surface micromorphology and porosity remain unchanged after surface modification. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that 7.7 % and 12.3% mass ratio of nHA were loaded on the PLA scaffold surface, respectively. The wettability test indicated that the hydrophilicity of nHA-coated scaffolds was greatly enhanced, while the mechanical properties remained uncompromised. The 3D laser scanning confocal microscope (3DLS) images revealed that the surface roughness was significantly increased, reaching Sa (arithmetic mean height) of 0.402 μm in PLA@PDA-HA7. Twenty-eight days of in-vitro degradation results showed that the introduction of nHA to the PLA surface enhances its degradation properties, as evidenced by the SEM images and weight loss test. Furthermore, a sustainable release of Ca2+ from PLA@PDA-HA3 and PLA@PDA-HA7 was recorded, during the degradation process. In contrast, the released hydroxyl group of nHA tends to neutralize the local acidic environments, which was more conducive to osteoblastic differentiation and extracellular mineralization. Taken together, this facile surface modification provides 3D printed PLA scaffolds with effective bone regenerative properties by depositing Ca2+ contents, improving surface hydrophilicity, and enhancing the in-vitro degradation rate.

In this work, we are focused on fused filament fabrication (FFF) and we intend to analyze the melt flow patterns generated by a commercial version of polycarbonate, modeled by means of a viscoelastic model (Giesekus) based on rheological properties experimentally determined under viscometric flows. The axisymmetric flow through the same longitudinal section nozzle geometry used in the work of Mendes et al. (2019) has been numerically simulated in steady state at a constant temperature using OpenFOAM® (O. Ltd, 2019) and rheoTool (Pimenta and Alves, 2016). The results show that although the extensional flow type is predominant in the fluid domain, the shear-induced normal stress differences are relevant, and even dominating, not only at the exit of the die but also in the tapered region of the nozzle. Shear-induced normal stress differences are responsible for the excess pressure drop, and also for the equilibrium height (H∗) in the backflow region, where the polymer melt flows upwards, between the solid filament that enters into the print-core and the liquefier wall. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Backflow; Die-swell; Fused filament fabrication (FFF); Material extrusion; Shear-induced normal stresses; Upstream vortex formation","Fabrication; Nozzles; Polymer melts; Shear flow; Viscoelasticity; Vortex flow; Back flow; Die-swell; Fused filament fabrication; Material extrusion; Normal stress; Normal stress difference; Shear-induced; Shear-induced normal stress; Upstream vortex formation; Vortex formation; Extrusion","","","","","ALiCE, (UIDP/00532/2020); COMPETE2020-Programa Operacional Competitividade e Internacionalização; Ultimaker B.V.; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT; Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior, MCTES, (LA/P/0045/2020); Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior, MCTES; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","Funding text 1: Authors would like to thank Laura Campo-Deaño and Francisco Pimenta for fruitful discussion and selfless support.

However, for evaluating skin disease drugs, human skin tissue in vitro constructed traditionally on Transwell has inefficient screening ability because of its fragile barrier function. With mechanical forces and dynamic flow, the organ-on-a-chip system became an innovative, automatic, and modular way to construct pathological models and analyze effective pharmaceutical ingredients in vitro. In this research, we integrated skin extracellular matrix and skin cells into a microfluidic chip to construct a biomimetic “interface-controlled-skin-on-chip” system (IC-SoC), which constructed a stable air–liquid interface (ALI) and necessary mechanical signals for the development of human skin equivalents. The results demonstrated that in the microfluidic system with a flowing microenvironment and ALI, the skin tissue formed in vitro could differentiate into more mature tissue morphological structures and improve barrier function. Then, following exposing the skin surface on the IC-SoC to the stimulation of Propionibacterium acnes (P.acnes) and SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate), the barrier function decreased, as well as inflammatory factors such as IL-1α, IL-8, and PEG2 increased in the medium channel of the IC-SoC. After this pathological skin model was treated with dexamethasone and polyphyllin H, the results showed that polyphyllin H had a significant repair effect on the skin barrier and a significant inhibition effect on the release of inflammation-related cytokines, and the effects were more prominent than dexamethasone. This automated microfluidic system delivers an efficient tissue model for toxicological applications and drug evaluation for bacterial-infected damaged skin instead of animals.

A method based on the special angle grain boundaries (in the range of 15–55° and 70–85°) is proposed for a clear and straightforward description of the prior β mesostructure. Post solution treatments below β transus retain the prior β grains and alter the fully martensitic microstructure into a mixture of α and α’/β phases. A non-traditional “bimodal structure” consisting of αP and αS’ phases is produced by subtransus treatments at a relatively high temperature. While treatments above β transus lead to the growth of prior β grains and transform the martensitic α’ phases into β phases first, and then back into α’ martensites again during quenching, leading to a new martensitic microstructure. The microhardness is determined by the α lath thickness and the amount of α’ martensite, and the latter is more predominant. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Heat treatment; Microstructure; Phase transformation; Selective laser melting; Ti6Al4V alloy","Aluminum alloys; Grain boundaries; Heat treatment; Martensite; Martensitic transformations; Melting; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Grain evolution; Grain-boundaries; Martensitic microstructure; Mesostructures; Non-traditional; Phases transformation; Selective laser melting; Solution heat treatment; Solution treatments; Ti-6Al-4V alloy; Microstructure","","","","","IMR Innovation Foundation, (2021-PY05); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51871223, 52130002); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, YIPA CAS, (2021192); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, YIPA CAS; K.

To estimate those important designs, referred to as participation-oriented designs in this study, a decision support model is developed based on quality function deployment (QFD). This model connects participation-oriented designs to solvers’ motives through the matched incentives, ensuring the estimated designs could activate solvers’ motives most. Specifically, the relations among these three aspects are represented by two house of quality (HoQ) models in which one links solver motives and incentives and the other connects the incentives and participation-oriented designs. Moreover, a combination of the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM), fuzzy Best-Worst method (BWM), and fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory Model (DEMATEL) is developed to handle information in these two HoQ models. Therein, the FDM is employed to screen and map solver motives, incentives, and participation-oriented designs. The fuzzy BWM is used to determine the relationship weights between solver motives and incentives and incentives and participation-oriented designs respectively. The fuzzy DEMATEL is employed to describe and calculate the inner dependencies of incentives and participation-oriented designs respectively. A case of the crowdsourcing platforms for graphic design contests is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed model. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Best-worst method; Crowdsourcing platform; Decision Making Trial; Evaluation Laboratory Model; Fuzzy Delphi method; Innovation contests; Quality function deployment","Crowdsourcing; Decision support systems; Function evaluation; Quality control; Quality function deployment; BAD methods; Best-bad method; Crowdsourcing platforms; Decision making trial; Decision support modelling; Decisions makings; Evaluation laboratory model; Fuzzy Delphi Method; Innovation contest; Laboratory models; Decision making","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71802002); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (19YJC630141); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE; Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI, (PID2019-103880RB-I00/AEI/10.13039/501100011033); Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI; Anhui Polytechnic University, AHPU","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71802002), Excellent Young Scholars funded by Anhui Polytechnic University, Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China (19YJC630141), and Spanish State Research Agency under Project PID2019-103880RB-I00/AEI/10.13039/501100011033.","Abdel-Basset M., Mohamed R., Zaied A.-E.-N.-H., Smarandache F., A hybrid plithogenic decision-making approach with quality function deployment for selecting supply chain sustainability metrics, Symmetry, 11, (2019); Acar O.A., Motivations and solution appropriateness in crowdsourcing challenges for innovation, Research Policy, 48, (2019); Aghaee A., Aghaee M., Fathi M.R., Shoa'bin S., Sobhani S.M., A novel fuzzy hybrid multi-criteria decision-making approach for evaluating maintenance strategies in petrochemical industry, Journal of Quality in Maintenance Engineering, 27, pp. 351-365, (2021); Alam S.L., Campbell J., Temporal motivations of volunteers to participate in cultural crowdsourcing work, Information Systems Research, 28, pp. 744-759, (2017); Asadabadi M.R., A customer based supplier selection process that combines quality function deployment, the analytic network process and a Markov chain, European Journal of Operational Research, 263, pp. 1049-1062, (2017); Battistella C., Nonino F., Open innovation web-based platforms: The impact of different forms of motivation on collaboration, Innovation, 14, pp. 557-575, (2012); Battistella C., Nonino F., Exploring the impact of motivations on the attraction of innovation roles in open innovation web-based platforms, Production Planning & Control, 24, pp. 226-245, (2013); Baykasoglu A., Golcuk I., Development of an interval type-2 fuzzy sets based hierarchical MADM model by combining DEMATEL and TOPSIS, Expert Systems with Applications, 70, pp. 37-51, (2017); Blohm I., Zogaj S., Bretschneider U., Leimeister J.M., How to manage crowdsourcing platforms effectively?, California Management Review, 60, pp. 122-149, (2018); Bockstedt J., Druehl C., Mishra A., Problem-solving effort and success in innovation contests: The role of national wealth and national culture, Journal of Operations Management, 36, pp. 187-200, (2015); Bouzon M., Govindan K., Rodriguez C.M.T., Campos L.M.S., Identification and analysis of reverse logistics barriers using fuzzy Delphi method and AHP, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 108, pp. 182-197, (2016); Brabham D.C., Moving the crowd at threadless, Information, Communication & Society, 13, pp. 1122-1145, (2010); Cabrerizo F.J., Urena R., Pedrycz W., Herrera-Viedma E., Building consensus in group decision making with an allocation of information granularity, Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 255, pp. 115-127, (2014); Camacho N., Nam H., Kannan P.K., Stremersch S., Tournaments to crowdsource innovation: The role of moderator feedback and participation intensity, Journal of Marketing, 83, pp. 138-157, (2019); Cevik Onar S., Buyukozkan G., Oztaysi B., Kahraman C., A new hesitant fuzzy QFD approach: An application to computer workstation selection, Applied Soft Computing, 46, pp. 1-16, (2016); Chan K.W., Li S.Y., Ni J., Zhu J.J., What feedback matters?

Recent literature shows limits in geometric modeling and data exchange, highlighting some improvements in the design of variable density lattice structures mainly for powder bed fusion technologies. Similar improvements are not available for material extrusion (MEX) technologies which show technological and numerical limits related to the computer numerical control programming language (G-code) generated by computer aided manufacturing (CAM) software. This work aims at overcoming the limits in fabricating graded density shell-based lattice structures for MEX technology by using the infill patterns available in the CAM software and editing the G-code based on a density map defined by volumetric models. Combining two usually separated phases, i.e., the geometric modeling and the CAM processing, several advantages are obtained, considering at the same time some of the technological constraints.The proposed approach is tested on a cubic sample and on a bracket fabricated by a fused filament fabrication technology. The results show that the method allows for the reduction of design efforts, amount of data exchanged, and processing time, obtaining an effective G-code and consistent components. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Functionally graded lattice structures; Material extrusion; Volumetric modeling","Additives; Cams; Computer aided manufacturing; Computer control systems; Computer programming; Design; Electronic data interchange; Extrusion; Fabrication; Geometry; Structural optimization; Computer-aided manufacturing; Extrusion technology; Functionally graded; Functionally graded lattice structure; G codes; Geometric models; Lattice structures; Manufacturing software; Material extrusion; Volumetric models; 3D printers","","","","","Università degli Studi di Padova, UNIPD","This work was partially funded by grant ‘ BIRD 190850 ′ by the Department of Civil, Environmental, and Architectural Engineering, University of Padova .","Gibson I., Rosen D., Stucker B., Khorasani M., Additive Manufacturing Technologies, Third Edit, (2021); Zhang Z.D., Et al., Topology optimization parallel-computing framework based on the inherent strain method for support structure design in laser powder-bed fusion additive manufacturing, Int.

The development of a real-time process monitoring system with the ability to properly forecast anomalous behaviors within fused deposition modeling (FDM) additive manufacturing is proposed as a solution to the particular problem of nozzle clogging. A set of collaborative sensors is used to accumulate time-series data and its processing into the proposed machine learning algorithm. The multi-head encoder–decoder temporal convolutional network (MH-ED-TCN) extracts features from data, interprets its effect on the different processes which occur during an operational printing cycle, and classifies the normal manufacturing operation from the malfunctioning operation. The tests performed yielded a 97.2% accuracy in anticipating the future behavior of a 3D printer. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing; machine learning; nozzle clogging; smart monitoring","","","","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, MEST, (2018R1A6A1A03024003, IITP-2021-2020-0-01612); Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, MEST","This research work was supported by Priority Research Centers Program through NRF funded by MEST (2018R1A6A1A03024003) and the Grand Information Technology Research Center support program (IITP-2021-2020-0-01612) supervised by the IITP by MSIT, Korea.","Dilberoglu U., Gharehpapagh B., Yaman U., Dolen M., The Role of Additive Manufacturing in the Era of Industry 4.0, Procedia Manuf, 11, pp. 545-554, (2017); Tlegenov Y., Hong G.S., Lu W.F., Nozzle condition monitoring in 3D printing, Robot.

Fake pornography is a harmful one because of the inclusion of fake content in the hoaxes, fake news, and fraud things in the financial. The Deep Learning technique is an effective tool in the detection of deepfake images or videos. With the advancement of Generative adversarial networks (GAN) in the deep learning techniques, deep fake has become an essential one in the social media platform. Fake faces may threaten the public, therefore detection of deepfake images/videos is needed. For detecting the forged images/videos, many research works have been done and those methods are inefficient in the detection of new threats or newly created forgery images or videos, and consumption time is high. There-fore, this paper focused on the detection of different types of fake images or videos using Fuzzy Fisher face with Capsule dual graph (FFF-CDG). The data set used in this work is FFHQ, 100K-Faces DFFD, VGG-Face2, and WildDeepfake. The accuracy for FFHQ data sets, the existing and proposed systems obtained the accuracy of 81.5%, 89.32%, 91.35%, and 95.82%, respectively. © 2022, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

The low thermal conductivity of the alloy causes accelerated tool deterioration when machining. Selective laser melting (SLM) additive manufacturing introduces a possibility of eliminating these difficulties, and producing complex shapes with this difficult-to-machine material. However, high surface roughness and porosity usually occur at the surface of components produced through additive manufacturing. In this study, the surfaces of Inconel 718 samples produced through selective laser melting were treated using laser ablation. The process parameters for the laser ablation process were analyzed in order to achieve a minimum surface roughness. The surfaces of the samples were observed after printing and after the laser ablation process using a microscope and the roughness average was measured using a profilometer. Optimized process parameters were achieved, and have the capability to reduce the surface roughness to a minimum Ra of 3.024 µm. © 2022","additive manufacturing; laser ablation; material removal; surface roughness","Additives; Deterioration; Laser ablation; Melting; Selective laser melting; Thermal conductivity; Ultrafast lasers; Highest temperature; Inconel-718; Lasers ablations; Low thermal conductivity; Material removal; Process parameters; Property; Selective laser melting; Surface improvement; Ultrafast laser ablation; Surface roughness","","","","","","","","J.

Tensile responses along the <100>, <110> and <111> crystallographic directions show considerably different strength ratios in different orientations from a standard face-centered cubic (FCC) alloy. A multi-scale crystal plasticity modelling methodology is developed to simulate and understand such unique orientation-dependent plastic deformation behaviour. The polycrystal model, based on the visco-plastic self-consistent (VPSC) formulation, considers deformation by slip and twinning, adapting a dislocation-based approach with latent hardening at single crystal level, including slip-slip, slip-twin, twin-slip and twin-twin interactions, to account for the orientation-dependent strain hardening behaviour. Based on the proposed multi-scale model, the orientation-dependent superior strength-ductility behaviour of textured PBF-LB SS316L can be attributed to the beneficial effects of deformation twinning and the cellular sub-grain structure. © 2022 The Author(s)","Crystal plasticity; Crystallographic texture; Laser beam powder bed fusion; Latent hardening; Tensile response","Crystal orientation; Plasticity; Single crystals; Strain hardening; Textures; Twinning; Crystal plasticity; Crystal plasticity models; Crystallographic directions; Crystallographic textures; Laser beam powder bed fusion; Latent hardening; Orientation dependent; Powder bed; Stainless steel (316L); Tensile response; Laser beams","","","","","Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, (16/RC/3872); Science Foundation Ireland, SFI","This publication has emanated from research conducted with the financial support of Science Foundation Ireland under Grant number 16/RC/3872 .

However, oxidation is hard to be avoided especially for the directed energy deposition (DED) processes, which are normally operated in an open environment with inert gas shielding. Excessive oxidation will negatively affect the mechanical properties of the deposited materials. In this work, inhibition of oxidation was studied through adding TiC particles for laser aided additive manufacturing (LAAM) of stainless steel 316L. Notably, oxygen content can be reduced significantly, as TiC particles functioned as deoxidizers through chemical reaction with oxygen. Meanwhile, the large Si–Cr–Mn oxides can be changed into uniformly distributed fine TiO2 in the deposited stainless steel 316L. Consequently, ductility of the deposited stainless steel 316L was significantly improved by 54.1% with 5.6% increase in yield strength and 11.4% increase in ultimate tensile strength. This study shows a new way to overcome the negative effects of oxidation on the properties of the additively manufactured materials. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Ductility; Laser aided additive manufacturing; Oxidation; Stainless steel; TiC","3D printers; Additives; Austenitic stainless steel; Inert gases; Oxidation; Oxygen; Silicon; Tensile strength; Titanium carbide; Titanium dioxide; Deposited materials; Deposition process; Directed energy; Energy depositions; Gas-shielding; Laser aided additive manufacturing; Open environment; Oxygen content; Stainless steel (316L); TiC particles; Ductility","","","","","Academy of Sciences Project of Guangdong Province, (2016GDASRC-0105); Majestic Rock Resources Pte Ltd, (020866-00001)","This work was financially supported by Academy of Sciences Project of Guangdong Province [grant number: 2016GDASRC-0105 ], and Majestic Rock Resources Pte Ltd [grant number: # 020866-00001 ].","Yin Y., Tan Q., Bermingham M., Mo N., Zhang J., Zhang M.X., Laser additive manufacturing of steels, international materials reviews, (2021); Saboori A., Piscopo G., Lai M., Salmi A., Biamino S., An investigation on the effect of deposition pattern on the microstructure, mechanical properties and residual stress of 316L produced by Directed Energy Deposition, Materials Science and Engineering A, 780, (2020); Uriondo A., Esperon-Miguez M., Perinpanayagam S., The present and future of additive manufacturing in the aerospace sector: a review of important aspects, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G:, J.

The great variances of CNTs in geometries including different diameters and lengths may inevitably result in extensive differences on material properties and reinforcing efficiencies in CNT reinforced epoxy composites. This paper investigated the dispersion characterizations and adhesion properties of CNT reinforced epoxy composites with different CNT geometries including three different CNT diameters and two different lengths by particle size analysis, single lap shear (SLS) tests, transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM and SEM). The experimental results showed that CNTs with larger diameter (50–100 nm) had a greater ability to achieve more uniform dispersion which further led to better adhesion properties. Although CNT length did not have an evident effect on the CNT dispersion, epoxy composites reinforced by normal-length CNTs (5–20 µm) had higher lap shear strength and toughness than those by shorter CNTs (0.5–2 µm). © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon nanotube (CNT); CNT geometries; Electron microscopy; Epoxy composites; Particle size analysis; Single lap shear test","Additives; Adhesion; Carbon black; Carbon nanotubes; Dispersions; Geometry; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Reinforced plastics; Scanning electron microscopy; Shear flow; Adhesion properties; Carbon nanotube; Carbon nanotube geometry; Effect of carbons; Epoxy composite; Large diameter; Nanotube diameters; Nanotube geometry; Reinforced epoxy; Single-lap shear tests; Epoxy composites","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CMMI-1750316); National Science Foundation, NSF","This work was supported the National Science Foundation under Grant No. CMMI-1750316.

In recent years, AM processes and instruments are developed to print structure with two or multiple materials to form alloy during printing. The material composition in the printing process became a critical issue in determining the quality of the printed part. This paper presents a new approach to detect the metal material composition in the printed structure through thermal imaging. This approach tests the temperature variation and cooling rate of the melt metal during it is cooling down to solid. Through a theoretical model, it is proved that the cooling rate is a function of the material thermal properties, which can be made use of for retrieving the material composition. For copper-Inconel 625 alloy, an alloy widely studied in metal additive manufacturing technology, the theoretical model shows that the cooling rate monotonically increases with the increase of copper's weight percentage at constant temperature. Such a relationship is also experimentally tested by using a high-speed camera observing the process of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). The experimental results validate the relationship given by the theoretical model. It shows that the developed technique is able to serve as a new methodology to measure the alloy composition in real-time, for improving the consistency of mechanical/thermal properties of the printed parts. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; composition monitoring; cooling rate; multi-material printing","Additives; Cooling; Copper alloys; High speed cameras; Infrared imaging; Metals; Structure (composition); Additive manufacturing process; Composition monitoring; Cooling rates; Material compositions; Metallic part; Multi materials; Multi-material printing; Rate monitoring; Small scale; Theoretical modeling; 3D printers","","","","","","","","Z.

When carrying out a lightweight design, considering the anisotropy during manufacturing, it can provide accurate performance estimates for subsequent manufacturing. The research object of this paper was the space node, which is very suitable for lightweight design because of its complex force. However, this method can also be used for those products that need to consider the performance after manufacture, especially in mass production, whereby the most suitable molding direction can be found using this method. At present, a large number of scholars have conducted related research on topology optimization for additive manufacturing (AM). However, there are few relevant research reports on the impact of different directions of additive manufacturing on the optimal design and manufacturing results. In this paper, using the bidirectional evolutionary optimization (BESO) method, anisotropic optimization analysis was carried out on space nodes that are currently popular in the field of additive manufacturing and topology optimization. The elastic constants in different directions were used as anisotropic material properties for optimization research in this paper through tensile testing, which was carried out on 316L stainless-steel specimens fabricated using Selective Laser Melting (SLM) technology. In addition, SEM analyses were performed to explore the microscopic appearance of the material. The study found that additive manufacturing is affected by the printing direction in terms of both macroscopic mechanical properties and microscopic material structure; the deformation obtained by anisotropic optimization was about 1.1–2.3% smaller than that obtained by isotropic optimization. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; anisotropy; BESO method; SLM; space nodes","","","","","","Key Laboratory of Civil Engineering Structure and Mechanics; Yunnan University Postgraduate Scientific Research Innovation Project, (2021Y285); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52268037); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Inner Mongolia University of Technology, IMUT, (2021KY002); Inner Mongolia University of Technology, IMUT","The project was supported by the Key Laboratory of Civil Engineering Structure and Mechanics, Inner Mongolia University of Technology (No.: 2021KY002).

However, few studies investigated the effects of particle size distribution and associated impact speeds on the quality of printed surfaces in Direct Energy Deposition (DED) processes. Due to the different characteristics of powder bed and powder fed printing mechanism, particle size distribution could be evaluated before the printing but could not be assessed in-situ during the printing process of SLS/SLM. The powder stream of the DED process provides the opportunity to evaluate the PSD in-situ using a novel laser diffraction method. The laser diffraction method was a well-established particle size distribution analysis method for soil granite. It can achieve a fast, accurate, and in-situ analysis but has never been studied in DED printing. In this study, a novel laser diffraction PSD analyzer was proposed. A high-speed camera was applied to investigate the relationship between the impact speed and carrier gas flux. Stainless steel 316L metal powders with different PSDs and impact speeds were DED printed, the surface roughness and tensile strength were measured to evaluate the effects of impact speeds and PSDs on the printing quality. The results showed that impact speed and PSD had considerable influences on the printed surface roughness and tensile strength of printed parts. This study paves the way for adopting laser diffraction as an in-situ monitoring tool for the DED processes. © 2022","Direct Energy Deposition; impact speed; laser diffraction; particle size distribution","3D printers; Deposition; Diffraction; High speed cameras; Laser heating; Light transmission; Particle size; Powder metals; Quality control; Sintering; Size distribution; Speed; Surface roughness; Tensile strength; Deposition process; Direct energy deposition; Energy depositions; Impact speed; Laser diffraction method; Laser diffractions; Particles-size distributions; Powder bed; Printed surface; Printing quality; Particle size analysis","","","","","","","","H.

Herein we find experimentally and numerically that the process of the air entrapment and the initial contact state of the drop with the substrate can be profoundly altered via an external electric field. In an electric field, the induced electric stresses at the bottom of the drop increase drastically right before the drop contacts the substrate, which acts against the lubrication pressure, resulting in reduced initial contact radius and air bubble size. When the external electric field reaches a critical value, the electrical stress accelerates the flow near the bottom of the drop and generates a conical tip quickly instead of a dimple, resulting in a centre contact and eliminating the air bubble entrapment. Based on the dipole mirror charge model, we find the dimensionless strength of critical electric field scales with the square root of capillary number based on the air viscosity. This scaling law of the critical electric field for eliminating the air bubble entrapment is verified experimentally and numerically. This work may offer a new way to mitigate defects caused by air bubble entrapment for inkjet printing and droplet-based additive manufacturing.  © ","bubble dynamics; drops; electrohydrodynamic effects","Lubrication; Air bubbles; Air entrapment; Bubble dynamics; Critical electric field; Drop Impact; Electrohydrodynamic effects; External electric field; Initial contact; Lubrication /; Solid surface; air bubble; electric field; pressure; viscosity; Electrohydrodynamics","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11932009, 51906073); Huazhong University of Science and Technology, HUST, (2017QYTD05); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province, (2020CFA028); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFB3200700)","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (no. 2021YFB3200700), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 11932009 and 51906073), the Natural Science Foundation of HuBei Province (2020CFA028) and the Academic Frontier Youth Team of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (2017QYTD05).

Although some studies have been conducted to classify or detect defects, the investigation of the distribution of defects has received relatively little attention. Currently, there are many studies which focus on the counting of objects and they typically adopt a backbone convolutional neural network to obtain an initial feature map, which contains more semantic information but loses some geometric details. In this paper, the distribution of surface defects and defect count estimation of additive manufactured components are first studied as well as presentation of a developed deep learning characterization method (DLCM) based on a detail-aware dilated convolutional neural network (DDCNN) incorporated with a fine details feature map extractor designed to obtain final fine semantic features. It features two dilated convolutional layer combination blocks (DCBs), which are proposed to fuse low-level features with semantic features. Data are acquired from the surface of a workpiece fabricated by SLM. A series of experiments have been conducted to validate the performance of the DLCM. Compared with the other main state-of-the-art methods, the proposed DLCM yields better results. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Convolutional neural network (CNN); Machine learning; Selective laser melting; Surface characterization; Surface defects","Additives; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Melting; Selective laser melting; Semantics; Characterization methods; Convolutional neural network; Feature map; Laser melting process; Selective laser melting; Semantic features; Semantics Information; Surface characterization; Workpiece; Surface defects","","","","","Research Grants Council of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China, (15202717); Research and Innovation Office of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University","The work described in this paper was mainly supported by a grant from the Research Grants Council of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China (Project No. 15202717 ).

The volatile compounds retained in these GAC beds saturate their pores and are periodically replaced by pristine GACs, which are frequently made from biomass materials such as coconut shell. Here, in order to recycle these exhausted GACs and reuse them again as adsorbents in a WWTP, a thermal regeneration of these wastes is proposed. Aiming to achieve more efficient and cleaner production, the pros and cons of using an oxidizing versus an inert atmosphere are evaluated. This work demonstrates that a simple thermal process at temperatures no higher than 350 °C for 1 h using an oxidizing atmosphere can achieve the regeneration of exhausted GAC with the appropriate characteristics for reuse as an adsorbent for gaseous emissions in a WWTP, evidencing a lower cost against a regenerative process in an inert atmosphere (about 20% lower in an oxidizing atmosphere). Their specific surface area and micropore volume values are around 475 m2/g and 0.264 cm3/g, respectively, which are in the range of characteristics of pristine GAC (406 m2/g and 0.229 cm3/g). The best regeneration yield was 96.8% for the SL-300-N2 sample. Interestingly, a regeneration at 900 °C using an inert atmosphere allows for the production of GACs with optimized textural properties (SBET ≈ 675 m2/g), a dual system of micro/mesopores (Vt ≈ 0.4 cm3/g and Vmicro ≈ 0.27 cm3/g), and also a regeneration efficiency of 90.5% for SL-900-N2, which would make it a raw material of interest for applications with more stringent requirements. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Granular activated carbon; Odor treatment; Porosity; Reuse; Thermal regeneration; WWTP","Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Granular materials; Pollution control; Volatile organic compounds; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Water treatment plants; Granular activated carbons; High surface area; Inert atmospheres; Odour treatments; Oxidizing atmosphere; Reuse; Surface porosity; Thermal regeneration; Thermal regeneration process; Waste water treatment plants; Porosity","","","","","Chelonia Association; European Social Fund and Junta de Andalucía, (PY20_00432); IUNAN; Ministry of Education , Culture, and Sport of Spain, (FPU2016, UCO-FEDER-1262384-R); Ministry of Education, Culture, and Sport of Spain; University Institute of Nanochemistry; Faculty of Science and Engineering, University of Manchester, FSE; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (CTM2017-88723-R, MAT2017-87541-R PID2020-117438RB-I00, PID2020-113931RB-I00); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF; Ministerio de Asuntos Económicos y Transformación Digital, Gobierno de España, MINECO; Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI","Funding text 1: The work is funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Competitiveness (MINECO), the Spanish State Research Agency (AEI) and the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) through Projects CTM2017-88723-R, MAT2017-87541-R PID2020-117438RB-I00 & PID2020-113931RB-I00, and the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Sport of Spain (Grant FPU2016).

It is shown that heat-treatment temperatures lower than 800 °C are not sufficient to completely undergo phase transformation from bcc-δ to fcc-γ, whereas temperatures higher than 800 °C lead to grain growth and thickening of hcp-ε phases. The latter has a severely negative effect on shape memory. Furthermore, heat treatment at 800 °C for more than 3 h leads to σ-phase formation, which also negatively affects the shape memory effect (SME) by changing the chemical composition of the fcc-γ matrix. The SME along the building direction (BD), is higher than that along the laser scanning direction (SD) and in 45° to the SD (45SD). The higher SME along the BD is attributed to the {110} texture in the plane normal to the BD, whereas almost random but weak {111} and {100} textures are observed in SD and 45SD. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy revealed that a high stacking fault density and very thin hcp-ε phase are formed in the heat-treated sample, which explains the higher SME regardless of direction, compared with conventionally fabricated Fe-based SMAs with a similar composition. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","4D printing; Additive manufacturing; Fe–Mn–Si; Laser powder bed fusion; Phase transformation; Shape memory alloys","Grain growth; Heat treatment; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Phase transitions; Shape-memory alloy; Textures; 4d printing; Fe-Mn-Si; Heat treatment conditions; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Phases transformation; Post heat-treatment; Post-heat treatment; Powder bed; Shape-memory effect; 3D printers","","","","","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (188290, IZKSZ2_188290/1); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (2019 K 1A3A1A14065695)","The work was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) through project number IZKSZ2_188290/1 and the National Research Foundation of Korea under grant number 2019 K 1A3A1A14065695, which is gratefully acknowledged.","Sato A., Chishima E., Soma K., Mori T., Shape memory effect in γ ⇄ є transformation in Fe-30Mn-1Si alloy single crystals, Acta Metall., 30, pp. 1177-1183, (1982); Stanford N., Dunne D.P., Thermo-mechanical processing and the shape memory effect in an Fe-Mn-Si-based shape memory alloy, Mater.

In this work, the effects of different solution temperatures on the microstructural evolution and tensile properties of repaired samples were investigated in detail. The results showed that the heat-treated microstructure in the deposited zone (DZ) mainly consisted of columnar grains along the building direction. Laves phase, needle-like η phase and γ′ phase were gathered in the interdendritic region. In contrast, the microstructure of the substrate zone (SZ) contained equiaxed grains with grain boundary (GB) η phase and a uniform distribution of γ′ phase. With the solution temperature increasing, the undesirable Laves phase was gradually dissolved, and its morphology varied from long-striped to granular. The number of η phases was observed to increase initially and then decrease with morphology changing to granular. The resultant granular η phase in SZ lost its pinning effect on GBs, leading to the rapid coarsening of grains in SZ. Tensile tests show that the dissolution of Laves phase and η phase in DZ helps to improve the ductility while the grain growth results in the decrease of tensile stress. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","718Plus; Heat treatment; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Repair; Wire and arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Coarsening; Grain boundaries; Grain growth; Life cycle; Morphology; Tensile testing; Textures; Wire; 718plus; Additive manufacturing technology; Columnar grain; Interdendritic regions; Laves phasis; Laves-phase; Microstructure evolutions; Needle-like; Solution temperature; Wire and arc additive manufacturing; Repair","","","","","National Major Science and Technology Projects of China, (2019-VII-0004-0144)","This work was supported by National Science and Technology Major Project (grant number. 2019-VII-0004-0144 ).","Zhao X., Chen J., Lin X., Huang W., Study on microstructure and mechanical properties of laser rapid forming Inconel 718, Mater.

However, the existing piezoelectric devices are mostly low-dimensional fibers or films, making it difficult to achieve a good balance between mechanical robustness and piezoelectric output. Herein, a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) scaffold with a hierarchical porous structure and geometry was fabricated by chemical-foaming-assisted fused deposition modeling (FDM). Chemical foaming was triggered by the heat accompanied during FDM molding, where a microporous structure was formed inside the part without affecting the geometric design to realize strain accumulation in normal space. Moreover, the conductive MWCNT formed discontinuous and parallel morphology around the pores, which not only promotes the polling process and formation of electrets, but also avoids the electrical breakdown caused by the formation of the conductive network. Accordingly, the combined effect of hierarchical structure and incorporation of MWCNT leads to a balanced piezoelectric (open circuit voltage of 8.46 V and short circuit current of 157 nA) and mechanical performance (compressive modulus of 14.07 MPa). These excellent properties all demonstrate the potential capabilities of the developed piezoelectric nanogenerators in the field of self-powered nanosensors and portable devices. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

This is a processing method to complete a three-dimensional modeling object by layer-by-layer stacking. A laser beam is used to cre-ate objects with minimal voids and distortion by ap-propriately setting the scanning speed, output inten-sity, spot diameter, hatch spacing, and other condi-tions. Repeating actual experiments to determine the optimal build conditions increases the cost of operat-ing the machine, such as electricity and labor, and the cost of materials when a modeling failure occurs. In recent years, attempts have been made to determine the optimal build conditions by analyzing the melting and solidification phenomena of metallic materials through precise simulations. However, it is necessary to set many physical property values as the parame-ters. Many physical property values are difficult to measure, and if these values are incorrect, the analysis results can differ significantly. In this study, a theoretical model for predicting the cross-sectional area and cross-sectional thickness of the melt pool using a single-track laser was developed using a small number of physical properties, such as melting point, thermal conductivity, and latent heat. To further exam-ine the validity of the theoretical model, experiments were conducted for comparison purposes. In this ex-periment, 5 × 1 × 1 mm rectangular specimens were stacked and fabricated by a metal additive manufacturing machine using different laser beam irradiation conditions. The fabricated samples were cut, polished, and etched with nital, and the melt pool shapes were measured. Finally, experimental and theoretical values were compared to confirm the validity of the con-structed theoretical model. This indicates that the proposed model can predict the melt pool shape. © Fuji Technology Press Ltd.","melt pool; metal additive manufacturing; powder bed fusion; selective laser melting","Forecasting; Lakes; Laser beams; Maraging steel; Melting; Powder metals; Selective laser melting; Condition; Melt pool; Metal additive manufacturing; Metal additives; Pool shape; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion; Property value; Selective laser melting; Theoretical modeling; Metals","","","","","","","Arai T., Technical Review of Laser Materials Processing in Japan, Int.

Specifically, the role of vapourisation and condensation of the multi-component metallic substrate is investigated to determine the importance of properly capturing the state transitions when understanding the substrate evolution. The framework is applied to a ternary metallic system; it is revealed that entrained vapour bubbles in chemically dissimilar flows promote greater homogenisation during the condensation and collapse of these bubbles when compared to non-condensing phases. It is further shown that as the laser power density is increased, there is a greater tendency for preferential element evaporation of the lighter elements; this preferential element evaporation is quantified numerically for the first time, and shown to be a non-linear function of power density. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; Heat transfer; Laser powder bed fusion; Thermal fluid dynamics; Vaporisation; Volume of fluid","3D printers; Chemical analysis; Condensation; Functions; Heat transfer; Substrates; Fluid-dynamics; Fundamental analysis; Fusion process; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; State transitions; Thermal fluid dynamic; Thermal fluids; Volume of fluids; Evaporation","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/T016728/1); University of Manchester","Funding text 1: The work presented in this manuscript is supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under the “Cobalt-free Hard-facing for Reactor Systems” grant EP/T016728/1. ; Funding text 2: The work presented in this manuscript is supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under the “Cobalt-free Hard-facing for Reactor Systems” grant EP/T016728/1.

Nevertheless, the chemical compositions of commercial welding wires are not especially designed for the wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) process, leading to excessive austenite formation (∼74%) in their as-built DSSs. In this research, the chemical composition of a flux-cored wire arc additively manufactured super duplex stainless steel (FCWA-AM SDSS) was especially designed based on its thermal-history to achieve the balanced α/γ ratio. Mechanisms describing the microstructure evolution of α and γ during the FCWA-AM process were also proposed. Cr2N was the secondary phase formed in the as-built SDSS, which acted as the nucleating sites of intragranular austenite during the cooling of the deposition layer and precipitated at Widmanstätten austenite boundaries in the subsequent intrinsic heat treatment (IHT). The corrosion tests suggested that a thicker and more stable passive film was formed on the surface of the as-built SDSS than the hot-rolled 2205 DSS but their pitting corrosion resistance were comparable because the precipitation of Cr2N hindered the improvement of pitting corrosion resistance. The as-built SDSS showed higher strength than previously reported WAAM DSSs because of the enhanced solid solution strengthening effect and the balanced α/γ ratio. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Corrosion resistance; Duplex stainless steel; Microstructure evolution; Strength; Wire arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Austenite; Duplex stainless steel; Ferrite; Hot rolling; Microstructure; Pitting; Steel corrosion; Wire; Chemical compositions; Flux-cored wire; Mechanical property and corrosion resistance; Microstructure evolutions; Pitting corrosion resistance; Strength; Superduplex stainless steels; Welding wires; Wire arc; Wire arc additive manufacturing; Corrosion resistance","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51775372, 52005366)","This program is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51775372 , Grant No. 52005366 ).

Hydrofoils are usually used as the simplified model of turbine blade for investigating complex problems. A NACA0015 hydrofoil is used to explore the weight reduction by setting internal structural support instead of the solid foil. Firstly, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation is conducted to have the hydraulic loading. Then, fluid-solid interaction (FSI) method is used to evaluate the stress and deformation of the initial solid foil. Rib plates are used as the internal structural support with two main parameters that the rib width trib and angle of rib γrib. The global dynamic-criterion (GDC) algorithm is used for optimizing the uniformed maximum stress SND and the uniformed weight WND of foil. Finally, the optimal foil is found with trib of 1.716 mm and γrib of 69.44°. The value of SND is 1.595 times of the initial foil and WND is reduced by 46.6%. A compromise solution is effectively found for both sufficient strength and lower weight. Grey relation analysis shows that the influence of trib is stronger than that of γrib especially for the weight. This study helps the additive manufacturing of marine turbine runner and blades. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Fluid-solid interaction; Hydrofoil; Maximum stress; Optimal design; Weight reduction","3D printers; Additives; Computational fluid dynamics; Hydraulic motors; Hydrofoils; Turbine components; Complex problems; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Fluid solid interaction; Maximum stress; Optimal design; Optimization design; Structural support; Turbine blade; Turbine runner; Weight reduction; computational fluid dynamics; computer simulation; design; hydraulics; optimization; stress analysis; Turbomachine blades","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51836010, 51879265)","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of National Natural Science Foundation of China No. 51836010 and No. 51879265 .","Arabnejad M.H., Amini A., Farhat M., Et al., Hydrodynamic mechanisms of aggressive collapse events in leading edge cavitation, J.

Parametric sensitivity analysis is vital in order to attain robust performance of Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes. This is to yield desired properties of the components fabricated given the complex process dynamics involved. Stochastic analysis of Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) process based on Monte Carlo simulation of the physics model as well as the surrogate models is found to be cumbersome or inefficient. In this work, Polynomial Chaos (PC) based response surface is utilized for stochastic analysis. The SLS physics is approximated using response surfaces utilizing lower-order polynomials. Unlike other surrogate models, sensitivity indices can be evaluated without additional computational expense. Thus, the framework is not only simple in implementation but also proven to be robust, accurate and computationally efficient with lower-order polynomials. Multiple key response properties are analyzed simultaneously for effects of input uncertainties. This was for the first-time stochastic analysis of SLS was performed with the complete and exhaustive treatment given to response data.

However, hydrogels often need ad hoc customization to generate specific tissue constructs. One popular strategy for hydrogel functionalization is to add nanoparticles to them. Here, we present a plant viral nanoparticle the turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), as a promising additive for gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels for the engineering of mammalian tissues. TuMV is a flexuous, elongated, tubular protein nanoparticle (700–750 nm long and 12–15 nm wide) and is incapable of infecting mammalian cells. These flexuous nanoparticles spontaneously form entangled nanomeshes in aqueous environments, and we hypothesized that this nanomesh structure could serve as a nanoscaffold for cells. Human fibroblasts loaded into GelMA-TuMV hydrogels exhibited similar metabolic activity to that of cells loaded in pristine GelMA hydrogels. However, cells cultured in GelMA-TuMV formed clusters and assumed an elongated morphology in contrast to the homogeneous and confluent cultures seen on GelMA surfaces, suggesting that the nanoscaffold material per se did not favor cell adhesion. We also covalently conjugated TuMV particles with epidermal growth factor (EGF) using a straightforward reaction scheme based on a Staudinger reaction. BJ cells cultured on the functionalized scaffolds increased their confluency by approximately 30% compared to growth with unconjugated EGF. We also provide examples of the use of GelMA-TuMV hydrogels in different biofabrication scenarios, include casting, flow-based-manufacture of filaments, and bioprinting. We envision TuMV as a versatile nanobiomaterial that can be useful for tissue engineering.

The outcomes demonstrated that the surface morphology of the bone scaffold after femtosecond laser treatment was micro-nano morphology. The hydrophobic structure of the scaffold was changed into a super-hydrophilic structure, improving the surface roughness, which was highly helpful for osteoblast adhesion and differentiation. The femtosecond laser surface treatment in vitro samples produced a thick layer of hydroxyapatite (HAP) with improved surface bioactivity. The effectiveness of osseointegration and interstitial growth of the specimens treated with the femtosecond laser surface were found to be better when bone scaffolds were implanted into the epiphysis of the tibia of rabbits. As a result, femtosecond laser therapy dramatically enhanced the surface activity of bone scaffolds and their capacity to integrate with the surrounding bone tissues, serving as a trustworthy benchmark for future biological scaffold research.

CFD analyzes were performed with OpenFOAM for various configurations and in all cases, the rhomboidal area of each pin fin was kept constant at 0.16 mm2, and the bottom surface of the substrate was subjected to a uniform heat flux of 69.3 kW/m2. Water with temperature-sensitive viscosity was taken as the cooling fluid, and copper with constant thermophysical properties was used for the solid domain. Parametric analyzes have been conducted for various combinations of geometric design variables such as pin fin angle (α), longitudinal pitch-to-diameter ratio (SL/D) and transverse pitch-to-diameter ratio (ST/D) with the flow attribute represented by pin fin Reynolds number (ReD). In the parametric investigations, α ranged from 30∘ to 90∘; ReD ranged from 20 to 100, and SL/D and ST/D were between 2.5 and 4.5. A multi-layer artificial neural network model (ANN), which was coded in Python and trained with parametric CFD results, was utilized to estimate off-design pin fin Nusselt numbers (NuD) and pin fin Poiseuille numbers (PoD), two objective functions representing thermal and hydrodynamic character, respectively. Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) was used to optimize the microchannel configuration, in which the individuals have been evaluated based on the multi-layer neural network prediction model. The constructed multi-layer neural network model predicted NuD and PoD with average errors of 1.39% and 1.02%, respectively. Among all design variables considered, α was found to be the most dominant one on NuD and PoD. Following the genetic algorithm, the majority of the optimal solutions appeared at ST/D around 2.5 and at ReD equal to 20 or 100. Over the entire range of ReD, NSGA-II suggested combinations of optimal α and SL/D yielding 4<NuD<11 and 6<PoD<32 appropriate for thermal or hydrodynamic demands. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial Neural Networks; Computational Fluid Dynamics; Diamond-shaped pin fins; Microchannel flow; Multi-objective optimization","Computational fluid dynamics; Diamonds; Fins (heat exchange); Genetic algorithms; Heat flux; Heat transfer; Hydrodynamics; Microchannels; Multilayer neural networks; Network layers; Reynolds number; Thermodynamic properties; Artificial neural network modeling; Design variables; Diamond-shaped pin fin; Microchannel flow; Modeling objectives; Multi-layer neural networks; Multi-objectives optimization; Pin-fins; Pitch-to-diameter ratios; Thermal; Multiobjective optimization","","","","","","","Lawson S.A., Thrift A.A., Thole K.A., Kohli A., Heat transfer from multiple row arrays of low aspect ratio pin fins, Int J Heat Mass Transf, 54, 17, pp. 4099-4109, (2011); Chiu H.-C., Hsieh R.-H., Wang K., Jang J.-H., Yu C.-R., The heat transfer characteristics of liquid cooling heat sink with micro pin fins, Int.

The feed region density was increased through compaction. The powder bed density and green density were determined by measuring the mass and dimension. The sintered density was measured with the Archimedes' method. As the relative feed region density increased from 44% to 65%, the powder bed density increased by 5.7%, green density by 8.5%, and finally sintered density by 4.5%. Statistical testing showed that these effects were significant. This study showed that compacting the powder in the feed region is an effective method to alter the density of parts made via binder jetting additive manufacturing.

This study uses multisource remote sensing and statistical data from 268 cities in China from 2008 to 2018, combined with ArcGIS analysis, super-efficiency EBM-DEA (Epsilon Based Measure-Data Envelopment Analysis), and SDM (spatial Durbin model) to explore the spatial effects of urban expansion on air pollution and eco-efficiency. The results show that the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomerations are the areas with the most serious air pollution, while the high-value areas of eco-efficiency are mainly concentrated in the eastern coastal areas, and the low-value areas are located in the central and western regions. During the study period, the center of gravity of air pollution and eco-efficiency shifted to the northeast. In addition, urban expansion has a significant U-shaped relationship with air pollution, and a significant inverted U-shaped relationship with eco-efficiency. Appropriate urban expansion has strong positive externalities on the direct and spillover effects of air pollution and eco-efficiency. However, excessive urban expansion has aggravated the air pollution of local cities, but it is beneficial to the air improvement of neighboring cities. Furthermore, for every 1% increase in UEI2 in provincial capital cities, air pollution decreases by 0.1705%, and eco-efficiency increases by 0.0244%.

The microstructure, mechanical properties and corrosion properties of the deposited alloy were evaluated. Microstructure observation and tensile testing of parts with different element contents indicated that functionally graded materials were obtained through the manufacturing process. The results have shown that due to the very high growth restriction factor Q of Cu, its addition can increase the constitutional supercooling zone, resulting in a decrease in columnar and dendrites and an increase in equiaxed crystals in the Inconel 625 Ni–Cu functionally graded material, as well as changing the Schmid factor (SF) distribution. The tensile strength and ductility of the Inconel 625 Ni–Cu functionally graded materials increased with increasing Cu content, while the corrosion resistance of the alloy decreased with increasing Cu content during electrochemical corrosion tests. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Corrosion; Functionally graded materials; Mechanical properties","Additives; Copper corrosion; Corrosion resistance; Corrosive effects; Electrochemical corrosion; Functionally graded materials; Industrial research; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Textures; Corrosion property; Cu content; Deposited alloy; Element contents; Feedback mechanisms; Inconel 625; Manufacturing techniques; Microstructure mechanical properties; Microstructure observation; Plasma arc; 3D printers","","","","","Foreign Experts Bureau Project of China, (G2021016026L, QN20200116001); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51975419)","This work was sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under the Grant No. 51975419 and Foreign Experts Bureau Project of China under Grant No. QN20200116001 , No. G2021016026L and No. G2021016026L .","Noda N., Thermal stresses in functionally graded materials, J.

Numerous factors affect the surface roughness of SLM-manufactured parts, which have been reported in the literature, but mostly for bulk samples composed of several layers. In this work, single-layer raster scanning of Ti6Al4V samples are designed and fabricated. The influence of the four most dominant SLM process parameters, i.e., laser power, scanning speed, hatch spacing, and layer thickness on sample surface roughness is thoroughly investigated using a fractional factorial design. Surface roughness data, acquired by white-light interferometry, from 216 data sets are then used to train a machine learning model with the back-propagation method and predict the surface roughness based on the input process parameters. The results show that the laser power is the most significant parameter in determining the top surface roughness of samples. Interestingly, although the investigated samples are single layer raster scanning areas on a solid SLM-built sample with the same parameter set, the layer thickness has a contribution of 10% to 15% in the variations of the surface roughness of the single layers. Furthermore, the machine learning algorithm achieves reasonable predictability, showing a coefficient of determination of 98.8% for a separate 32 testing data set. © 2022","Artificial neural network; Machine learning; Selective laser melting; Surface roughness; Titanium alloy","Aluminum alloys; Backpropagation; Deep learning; Melting; Neural networks; Powder metals; Scanning; Selective laser melting; Statistical tests; Surface roughness; Ternary alloys; Vanadium alloys; Data set; Laser power; Layer thickness; Machine-learning; Process parameters; Raster scanning; Selective laser melting; Single layer; Surface study; Titanium (alloys); Titanium alloys","","","","","","","","B.

However, due to the lack of adequate and effective process monitoring, it is difficult to ensure the reliability of as-built parts and the stability of the additive manufacturing process. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the as-built part quality of the SLM process. An in situ quality monitoring method of acoustic emission (AE) based on machine learning and improved variational modal decomposition (VMD) is proposed in the present work. The VMD parameters are adjusted based on the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and average energy entropy to realize the adaptive decomposition of the AE signals. Each sub-mode is evaluated according to the signal energy, the feature vector used for SLM printing quality prediction is extracted. Finally, the artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) are employed for quality prediction. The improved VMD method is compared with empirical modal decomposition (EMD), aiming to verify the predictive validity of printing quality in the SLM process. The results show that predicting SLM printing quality based on improved VMD is better than the EMD method. Meanwhile, it is verified that online monitoring of SLM for improving printing quality can be achieved based on the AE technique. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Acoustic emission monitoring; Machine learning; Selective laser melting; Variational mode decomposition","Acoustic emission testing; Additives; Forecasting; Melting; Neural networks; Process control; Process monitoring; Selective laser melting; Support vector machines; Acoustic emission monitoring; Acoustic-emissions; Laser melting process; Machine-learning; Modal decomposition; Modal decomposition methods; On-machines; Printing quality; Quality prediction; Selective laser melting; Variational mode decomposition","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai in China, (20ZR1414000); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, NNSF, NSF, NSFC, (51835003, 52175140); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, NNSF, NSF, NSFC; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM, (19110712500); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM; Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities of the Central South University","This research work is sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52175140, No. 51835003), International Collaboration Program from Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality in China (No. 19110712500), Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai in China (No. 20ZR1414000), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China.

The optimal length of the nonlinear crystal for an SLM oscillation of the intracavity frequency-doubling laser is firstly theoretically predicted by comparing the losses introduced by the nonlinear crystal with different lengths with that of ensuring the SLM operation of the laser. Then three nonlinear LiB3O5 (LBO) crystals with the length of 18, 20, and 22 mm are adopted to be the frequency-doubling components in the experiment. By recording the output power and monitoring the longitudinal mode structure of the laser, it is found that the nonlinear LBO crystal with the length of 20 mm is the best candidate, since the output power is higher than that of the LBO crystal with the length of 18 mm, and the SLM operation of the laser is readily achieved compared to that of the LBO crystal with the length of 22 mm. The experimental results well agree with the theoretical predictions. The current method can pave a good way to attain a single-frequency continuous-wave intracavity frequency-doubling laser. © 2022 Optica Publishing Group.","","Crystal structure; Frequency doublers; Crystal length; Frequency-doubling; High power; Intracavity frequency doubling lasers; Nonlinear crystals; Optimisations; Output power; Single longitudinal mode; Single longitudinal mode operation; Single-frequency; Lithium compounds","","","","","Program for the Innovative Talents of High Education Institution of Shanxi; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61975100, 62027821, 62105192); Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, CUPT; Shanxi Provincial Key Research and Development Project, (201901D211186, 20210302121004)","Funding.

The microstructure of the wheel was studied by Light Optical Microscopy (LOM) and the chemical composition was analyzed by Optical Emission Spectrometry (OES). Tensile tests were performed in samples extracted from the fractured wheel to evaluate mechanical properties. The results from the material's characterization combined with the fractographic examination and the stress analysis by finite-element modeling (FEM) allowed to conclude that the wheel failed due to fatigue originated in a heavily deformed surface layer produced by rolling contact fatigue (RCF), which was not timely removed in maintenance interventions. The main crack propagated from the surface to the rim and caused a failure known as Vertical Split Rim (VSR).  © 2022 - IOS Press.

Advance of this emerging technology is bottlenecked by the unavailability of high-fidelity prediction tools for cost-effective optimization on printing design. Simulations of selective laser melting of metals must tackle a complex granular solids and multiphase fluids system that undergoes intra- and inter-phase interactions and thermal-induced phase changes, including melting, vaporization, and solidification, which are challenging to model. We develop a high-fidelity computational tool to provide high-resolution simulations of the multiphase, multiphysics processes of selective laser melting (SLM). Key to this tool is a multi-phase, semi-coupled resolved Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Discrete Element Method (DEM). It contains innovative features including (1) a fully resolved immersed boundary CFD with fictitious particle domain coupling with DEM for resolving mechanical interactions and heat transfers between solid particles and surrounding fluid; (2) An evaporation model in consideration of the Knudsen layer implemented in the volume of fluid (VOF) method which is enriched by two sharp interface capture schemes, isoAdvector and MULES, for accurate identification of the vaporization process and phase boundaries of fluids with different Courant numbers; and (3) a ray tracing model compatible with the VOF method for high-resolution of absorbed laser energy. We demonstrate the proposed method can quantitatively reproduce key observations from synchrotron experiments and captures critical interdependent physics involving melt pool morphology evolution, vapor-driven keyhole dynamics and powder motions. This new computational tool opens a new avenue for quantitative design and systematic optimization of laser powder bed fusion and may find wider engineering applications where thermal induced phase changes in a multi-phase system are important. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Coupled CFD-DEM; Granular powder; Multiphase fluids; Selective laser melting","Additives; Computational methods; Cost effectiveness; Finite difference method; Heat transfer; Melting; Multiphysics; Powder metals; Selective laser melting; Thermal Engineering; Vaporization; Computational tools; Coupled computational fluid dynamic-discrete element method; Discrete elements method; Granular powder; High-fidelity; Laser powders; Multi-physics; Multiphase fluids; Multiphases; Selective laser melting; Computational fluid dynamics","","","","","Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone, (HZQB-KCZYB-2020083); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11972030); Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局, (16205418)","The study was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (via General Project # 11972030 ) and Research Grants Council of Hong Kong (under GRF #16205418 ).

The effect of annealing heat treatment (AHT) on microstructure and corrosion behavior of specimens in 3.5 wt% NaCl and 1 mol/L H2SO4 electrolytes was investigated. Results showed that AHT led to the reduction of the non-equilibrium phase α′ and texture weakening. AHT700 was beneficial to achieve crystal refinement while AHT850 had obvious coarsening phenomenon. In addition, AHT could improve the corrosion behavior of the specimens due to the reduction of α′ phase and relief of residual stress. Compared with the specimen of AHT850, the specimen of AHT700 with finer crystal size and obvious texture weakening improved the corrosion resistance more obviously. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Annealing heat treatment; Corrosion behavior; Microstructure; Ti6Al4V alloy; Vacuum","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Aluminum corrosion; Annealing; Coarsening; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant alloys; Electron beams; Fabrication; Laser beams; Residual stresses; Selective laser melting; Sodium chloride; Stress relief; Ternary alloys; Textures; Titanium alloys; % reductions; Corrosion behaviour; Crystal refinement; Effect of annealing; Feed additives; In-vacuum; Non-equilibrium phase; Thin walls; Ti-6Al-4V alloy; Vacuum environment; Corrosive effects","","","","","Chongqing University of Technology, CQUT, (2019ZD11); Chongqing University of Technology, CQUT; Chongqing Municipal Education Commission, CQMEC, (KJQN202101148); Chongqing Municipal Education Commission, CQMEC; Natural Science Foundation Project of Chongqing, Chongqing Science and Technology Commission, (cstc2020jcyj - msxmX0505); Natural Science Foundation Project of Chongqing, Chongqing Science and Technology Commission","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation Project of Chongqing Science and Technology Commission (Grant No. cstc2020jcyj - msxmX0505 ), internal financial support from Chongqing University of Technology (Grant No. 2019ZD11 ), and Scientific and Technological Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission (Grant No. KJQN202101148 ).","DebRoy T., Wei H.L., Zuback J.S., Mukherjee T., Elmer J.W., Milewski J.O., Beese A.M., Wilson-Heid A., De A., Zhang W., Additive manufacturing of metallic components-process, structure and properties, Prog.

Accordingly, AWA should be disposed to preserve the environment. This study focuses on using AWA as a partial substitute for cement to produce ultrahigh-strength concrete (UHSC). This research investigated the effect of using sugarcane leaf ash (SLA) as a pozzolanic material on the properties of UHSC. The cement replacement rates by SLA were 10%, 20% and 30% by weight. SLA was heat-treated at 400, 500, 600, 700 and 800 °C for 2 h to improve its physical and chemical properties. The effects of the heat-treated SLA on UHSC mechanical properties such as, compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength and modulus of elasticity, were studied. The effects of heat-treated SLA on UHSC durability such as, water permeability, chloride penetration and sorptivity of UHSC were also investigated. In addition to, microstructure analysis of several UHSC mixtures was presented. Results showed the efficiency of SLA as a partial substitute of the 20% of cement weight with mechanical properties and durability higher than the mechanical properties and durability of the reference mixture. Compared with the reference mixture, the heat-treated SLA used as a partial substitute generally improved all properties. The UHSC containing SLA heat-treated at 700 °C and a 20% substitution rate achieved the best results of 162.5, 17.78, 24.05 and 55,820 MPa for compressive strength, tensile strength, bending strength and modulus of elasticity at test age of 28 days. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Durability; Heat-treated; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Sugarcane leaf ash; Ultrahigh-strength concrete","Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Bending strength; Cements; Chlorine compounds; Compressive strength; Concrete mixtures; Durability; Elastic moduli; Mixtures; Tensile strength; Agricultural productions; Cement replacement; Global expansion; Heat-treated; Mechanical durability; Pozzolanic materials; Production increase; Property; Sugarcane leaf ash; Ultra high strength concretes (UHSC); Microstructure","","","","","","","Huntzinger D.N., Eatmon T.D.J., A Life-cycle assessment of Portland cement manufacturing: comparing the traditional process with alternative technologies, J.

In this research, a new origami-inspired structure is proposed as an infill pattern for material deposition-based additive manufacturing applications. Origami techniques derived from antique paper folding arts have been applied to solve engineering problems such as space-saving structures and rapid deployment for their foldability. Recently, origami techniques have also shown another potential in mechanical reinforcement for structural designs. Studies have shown that the mechanical behavior can be significantly improved by combining origami patterns to tubular or box structures. This paper applies a Kresling-inspired structure as the infill pattern for additive manufacturing (AM) to achieve a better lateral compression performance. Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is selected as the testbed for the origami-inspired infill patterns. Results showed that the samples with origami infills had higher ultimate compressive strength, stiffness, and energy absorption than samples with grid or honeycomb infill patterns. This novel structural reinforcement method can be expanded to crash-worthy structures, functional structures, and the design of lightweight, high-strength parts. © 2022","additive manufacturing; infill pattern; origami; structural reinforcement","Additives; Compressive strength; Industrial research; Infill drilling; Reinforcement; Structural design; Engineering problems; Infill pattern; Interior structure; Manufacturing applications; Material deposition; Origami; Paper folding; Rapid deployments; Space savings; Structural reinforcement; 3D printers","","","","","","","","H.

However, support structures often consume significant amount of material, print-time and post-processing time. Furthermore, the optimal design of these support structures is challenging due to the transient nature of the LPBF process. Consequently, support structures are often sub-optimal, and are designed based on experience. Here, we propose the concept of an aggregate equivalent static load (ESL) for the design of support structures. Starting with a simple transient simulation of the layer-wise LPBF build process, we extract the ESL at the end of each time step. An aggregate ESL is then computed for minimizing the thermal compliance of support structures, subjected to a volume constraint. The ESL concept is demonstrated here using truss-type support structures; however, it is equally applicable for other types of supports. Truss-type supports are generated using a novel greedy algorithm, and then the aggregate ESL strategy is applied to optimize the size of truss members. Numerical experiments are conducted to ascertain the self-consistency of the proposed method. The optimized cross-section areas of truss members are then converted to manufacturable designs, and sample parts are fabricated for validation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Equivalent static load; Laser powder bed fusion; Optimization; Support structures","3D printers; Additives; Aggregates; Ground supports; Metals; Optimal systems; Powder metals; Shape optimization; Structural optimization; Trusses; Equivalent static load; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Metal additives; Optimal design; Optimisations; Powder bed; Static loads; Support structures; Truss members; Numerical methods","","","","","ADDLab; Alloy Design and Development Laboratories; Technical Data Analysis Inc., (00030-18-C-0239); UW2020 WARF; University of Wisconsin-Madison, UW; Small Business Technology Transfer, STTR, (68335-19-C-0321); Small Business Technology Transfer, STTR","Funding text 1: The specimens were printed at the Alloy Design and Development Laboratories (ADDLab) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Herein, we innovatively fabricated photo-crosslinkable methacrylated konjac glucomannan (KGMMA) as a novel biomaterial ink for 3D extrusion bioprinting in an attempt to construct precisely patterned tissues. Specifically, konjac glucomannan (KGM) was modified by methacrylic anhydride, which is a kind of photoreactive group, to form KGMMA. After UV crosslinking, the printed KGMMA hydrogel formed a covalent crosslinking network with high strength, desired shearing, and swelling and degradation characteristics. The properties of the KGMMA hydrogel could be modulated by changing the contents of MA. The shear-thinning property of the KGMMA biomaterial ink enables excellent printability, which can print different shapes including lattices, hexagons, and flowers. Furthermore, the bioinks support cell growth after being printed with chondrocytes for a culture. Therefore, the biodegradable, injectable, and photo-crosslinkable KGMMA biomaterial ink holds a great promise for cartilage tissue engineering. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Biocompatible Materials; Bioprinting; Hydrogels; Ink; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Rheology; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; 3D printers; Biocompatibility; Cartilage; Cell proliferation; Crosslinking; Shear thinning; Tissue engineering; hydrogel; mannan; (1-6)-alpha-glucomannan; biomaterial; ink; Bioprinting; Cartilage tissue engineering; Covalent crosslinking; Cross-linkable; High-strength; Konjac glucomannan; Methacrylic anhydride; Property; Swelling characteristics; UV-crosslinking; Article; cell culture; cell growth; cell viability; chemical modification; chondrocyte; covalent bond; cross linking; cytotoxicity; degradation; in vitro study; mechanical test; swelling; three dimensional bioprinting; tissue engineering; ultraviolet radiation; bioprinting; flow kinetics; hydrogel; procedures; three dimensional printing; tissue scaffold; Hydrogels","","mannan, 51395-96-1, 9036-88-8; (1-6)-alpha-glucomannan, ; Biocompatible Materials, ; Hydrogels, ","","","Nanning Qingxiu District Science and Technology Major Special Project, (2020013); Science and Technology Major Project of Guangxi, (GuikeAA19254002); Science and Technology Major Project of Guangxi; Specific Research Project of Guangxi for Research Bases and Talents, (GuikeAD19254003); Specific Research Project of Guangxi for Research Bases and Talents","This study was financially supported by the Guangxi Science and Technology Base and Talent Special Project (Grant No. GuikeAD19254003), the Guangxi Science and Technology Major Project (Grant No. GuikeAA19254002), and the Nanning Qingxiu District Science and Technology Major Special Project (Grant No. 2020013).

Currently used subtractive manufacturing techniques require a multi-step process to obtain a rough surface topography that stimulates osseointegration. Advantageously, additive manufacturing (AM) enables direct implant shaping with unique geometries and surface topographies. In this study, zirconia implants with integrated lamellar surface topography were additively manufactured by nano-particle ink-jetting. The ISO-14801 fracture load of as-sintered implants (516±39 N) resisted fatigue in 5–55 °C water thermo-cycling (631±134 N). Remarkably, simultaneous mechanical fatigue and hydrothermal aging at 90 °C significantly increased the implant strength to 909±280 N due to compressive stress generated at the seamless transition of the 30–40 µm thick, rough and porous surface layer to the dense implant core. This unique surface structure induced an elongated osteoblast morphology with uniform cell orientation and allowed for osteoblast proliferation, long-term attachment and matrix mineralization. In conclusion, the developed AM zirconia implants not only provided high long-term mechanical resistance thanks to the dense core along with compressive stress induced at the transition zone, but also generated a favorable osteoblast response owing to the integrated directional surface pores. Statement of significance: Zirconia ceramics are becoming the material of choice for metal-free dental implants, however significant efforts are required to obtain a rough/porous surface for enhanced osseointegration, along with the risk of surface delamination and/or microstructure variation. In this study, we addressed the challenge by additively manufacturing implants that seamlessly combine dense core with a porous surface layer. For the first time, a unique surface with a directional lamellar pore morphology was additively obtained. This AM implant also provided strength as strong as conventionally manufactured zirconia implants before and after long-term fatigue. Favorable osteoblast response was proved by in-vitro cell investigation. This work demonstrated the opportunity to AM fabricate novel ceramic implants that can simultaneously meet the mechanical and biological functionality requirements. © 2022","3D-printing; Additive manufacturing; Contact guidance; Directional pores; Implant; Osteoblast; Zirconia","3D printers; Additives; Compressive stress; Fatigue of materials; Nanoparticles; Surface topography; Topography; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Contact guidance; Directional pore; Implant; Mechanical; Osseointegration; Osteoblast response; Rough surfaces; Surface pores; Zirconia","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (VITA-SAF-2020–01001, 19K10241); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS; Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, FWO, (12S8421N, 12S8418N, G095920N, G0B2618N); Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, FWO; KU Leuven, (C24/17/084); KU Leuven","Fei Zhang thanks the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO Vlaanderen) for her post-doctoral fellowship (12S8418N, 12S8421N).

The inactive element, which is a finite element having zero stiffness, is used in several fields such as multi-pass welding analysis, additive manufacturing analysis, damage analysis, and topology optimization. For this sort of analysis, we adopted the one-time decomposition approach, in which the DD process is performed once at the beginning of the analysis. Based on this approach, we formulated the matrix–vector multiplication, the preconditioning and the vector operations in the algorithm of the conjugate gradient method, along with the inactive elements and floating degrees of freedom caused by the inactive elements. Consideration of the inactive elements is enabled by the slight modifications of matrices and vectors in the algorithm. Numerical examples confirmed the scalability of the BDD and BDD-DIAG preconditioners with the present implementation method. Moreover, the capability of the present method for damage analysis, topology computation, and thermal elastic–plastic analysis of metal additive manufacturing problems was demonstrated. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","additive manufacturing analysis; damage analysis; domain decomposition method; inactive element method; parallel finite element method; topology optimization","3D printers; Additives; Conjugate gradient method; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Finite element method; Metal analysis; Numerical methods; Topology; Additive manufacturing analyse; Balancing domain decomposition; Damage analysis; Domain decompositions; Domain-decomposition methods; Element method; Inactive element method; Parallel finite element method; Preconditioners; Topology optimisation; Domain decomposition methods","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (19K14871)","The present study was supported by the Grants\u2010in\u2010Aid for Scientific Research of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Grant Number JP19K14871).

Such a coarsening process is driven by multiple dissolution and precipitation transformations rather than by conventional Ostwald ripening. It is clear that during the first cycle, the complete dissolution of the thinnest α plates at the heating stage provides large spaces for surviving plates to regrow at the cooling stage, which results in coarsening after the first cycle. However, it is still unclear how the α plates continue to vanish and the remaining α plates sustainably coarsen in the repeated thermal cycles. In this study, cyclic heat-treatment experiments and phase-field simulations were conducted to illustrate the mechanism of sustained coarsening during thermal cycling. It was found that in addition to the complete dissolution of the thinnest α plates in the first thermal cycle, α-plate vanishing continued during repeated thermal cycling in two ways, which has not been reported before. The origin of such sustained vanishing of α plates is related to the Gibbs–Thomson effect. Moreover, the influences of cycling frequency and total duration on the transformation coarsening are detected. Both the experimental and simulation results indicate that long cycling duration results in severe coarsening, while for a given duration time, the final coarsening of the α plates is almost independent of the cycling frequency. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Microstructure evolution; Phase transformation; Phase-field simulation; Titanium","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Coarsening; Dissolution; Heat treatment; Phase transitions; Ternary alloys; Thermal cycling; Titanium; Titanium alloys; Coarsening process; Complete dissolution; Cyclic heat treatments; Cyclic phasis; Cycling frequencies; First cycle; Microstructure evolutions; Phase-field simulation; Phases transformation; Thermal-cycling; Ostwald ripening","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51874245); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Northwestern Polytechnical University, NPU, (2020-TS-06); Northwestern Polytechnical University, NPU; State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing, SKLSP; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (3102019ZD0402); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 51874245 ), the Research Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing ( NPU ), China (Grant No. 2020-TS-06 ) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( 3102019ZD0402 ).

Separation techniques utilizing simple, cost-effective, and user-friendly devices are highly desirable, both in the lab and at the point of need. Passive microfluidic approaches, especially inertial microfluidics, fit this brief perfectly and are highly desired. Using an optimized additive manufacturing technique, we developed a zigzag microchannel for rigid inertial separation and enrichment, hereafter referred to as Z-RISE. We empirically showed that the Z-RISE device outperforms equivalent devices based on curvilinear (sinusoidal), asymmetric curvilinear, zigzag with round corners, or square-wave formats and modelled this behavior to gain a better understanding of the physics underpinning the improved focusing and separation performance. The comparison between rigid and soft zigzag microchannels reveals that channel rigidity significantly affects and enhances the focusing performance of the microchannel. Compared to other serpentine microchannels, zigzag microfluidics demonstrates superior separation and purity efficiency due to the sudden channel cross-section expansion at the corners. Within Z-RISE, particles are aligned in either double-side or single-line focusing positions. The transition of particles from a double-focusing line to a single focusing line introduced a new phenomenon referred to as the plus focusing position. We experimentally demonstrated that Z-RISE could enrich leukocytes and their subtypes from diluted and RBC lysed blood while depleting dead cells, debris, and RBCs. Z-RISE was also shown to yield outstanding particle or cell concentration with a concentration efficiency of more than 99.99%. Our data support the great potential of Z-RISE for applications that involve particle and cell manipulations and pave the way for commercialization perspective in the near future. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Cell Separation; Erythrocyte Count; Erythrocytes; Leukocytes; Microfluidic Analytical Techniques; Microfluidics; Cells; Cost effectiveness; Cytology; Focusing; Microchannels; Microfluidics; Separation; Serpentine; serpentine; Cost effective; Down-stream; Focusing performance; Inertial microfluidics; Manufacturing techniques; Pre-treatments; Separation techniques; Simple++; Target cells; User friendly; Article; bright field microscopy; cell manipulation; cell viability; comparative study; computer aided design; controlled study; epifluorescence microscopy; equipment design; erythrocyte; flow cytometry; gravity; human; human cell; hydrodynamics; leukocyte; lymphocyte; microfluidic analysis; microfluidics; monocyte; particle size; rigid inertial separation and enrichment; separation technique; three dimensional printing; turbulent flow; cell separation; erythrocyte count; microfluidic analysis; microfluidics; Efficiency","","serpentine, 12168-92-2, 131-07-7, 18786-24-8","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP200101860); Australian Research Council, ARC; National Health and Medical Research Council, NHMRC, (APP1171821); National Health and Medical Research Council, NHMRC","M.

Here, we demonstrate a set of fully three-dimensional (3D) printed band-stop filters fabricated by printing reactive silver ink onto three different additively manufactured resin substrates with varying dielectric properties. Each of the dielectric substrates were fabricated using stereolithography or digital light processing printing methods. By switching from a dielectric with tanδ = 0.06 to one with tanδ = 0.0073, we can decrease the total loss present in the structure by up to 2 dB. As enabled by 3D additive manufacturing, we also show that regardless of the dielectric material, moving from two-dimensional planar patterns to fully-3D topographies allows us to simultaneously widen the filter stopband by 2 GHz and theoretically increase signal rejection by up to 30 dB. This demonstration of a fully additively-manufactured, 3D band-stop filter that closely matches simulations represents a new class of device construction that was previously inaccessible using only 2- and 2.5-D manufacturing techniques. © 2022 The Author(s).

This applies particularly to geometric accuracy and the influence process parameters have on it. The paper describes an experiment in which 27 copies of a part were manufactured by means of a desktop fused filament fabrication device while manipulating layer thickness, printing speed, and number of contours. The effect of such process parameters on five typologies of geometric deviations and the duration of the printing process was assessed. While all the process parameters showed effects on both the printing time and some geometric deviations, the number of contours resulted as the most critical factor. The paper includes a proposal to optimize geometric accuracy and the rapidity of the process, which foresees the maximization of the number of contours, the minimization of the layer thickness, and the use of an intermediate value for printing speed. © 2022, The Author(s).","Coordinate measuring machine; Engineering design; Fused deposition modelling; Geometric tolerances; Process parameters; Rapid prototyping","Fits and tolerances; Fused Deposition Modeling; Geometry; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Engineering design; Geometric accuracy; Geometric deviations; Geometric tolerance; Layer thickness; Printing speed; Process parameters; Rapid-prototyping; Deposition","","","","","Machining and Production of Additive Manufactured Composites; Libera Università di Bolzano, UNIBZ","Open access funding provided by Libera Università di Bolzano within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.

The mixture of metal powder and binder goes through heating, extrusion, debinding and sintering processes to produce the compact finished part. However, it is generally believed that parts produced by FDMS possess poor and anisotropic tensile properties, which always attributes to the weak interlayer combination. The current work aimed to enhance tensile properties and better understand the anisotropic fracture behavior of the 316L stainless steel prepared by FDMS. By process optimization, the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength obtained in this work are increased by 26.1% and 15.2%, based on the highest performance reported in previous studies. According to the ultimate tensile strength, the performance difference between the horizontal and vertical directions has been reduced to 27%. Furthermore, the experimental results indicated that the clustered irregular shape holes evolved from primitive voids prefer to distribute in the build direction, resulting in anisotropic tensile performance. It is suggested that the mechanical properties could be improved by applying a smaller extrusion diameter and rolling-assisted printing. In addition, the current FDMS parts show qualified performance for producing the customized and small batch components. © 2022, Shanghai University and Periodicals Agency of Shanghai University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","316L stainless steel; Anisotropy; Fracture behaviour; Fused deposition modelling; Mechanical properties","Anisotropy; Austenitic stainless steel; Deposition; Extrusion; Fracture; Fracture mechanics; Fused Deposition Modeling; Optimization; Powder metals; Tensile strength; 'current; 316 L stainless steel; Additive manufacturing technology; Fracture behavior; Low-high; Metal additives; Performance; Steel parts; Tensile fractures; Ultimate tensile strength; Sintering","","","","","Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Additive Manufacturing of High-performance Materials and Elementplus Material Technology Co.

The RCS of six commercial UAVs is measured at 15 and 25 GHz in an anechoic chamber for both vertical-vertical (VV) polarization and horizontal-horizontal (HH) polarization. The RCS signatures are used to train 15 different recognition algorithms, each belonging to one of three different categories: statistical learning (SL), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL). The study shows that, while the average accuracy of all the algorithms increases with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the ML algorithm achieved better accuracy than the SL and DL algorithms. For example, the classification tree ML achieves an accuracy of 98.66% at 3-dB SNR using the 15-GHz VV-polarized RCS test data from the UAVs. We investigate the recognition accuracy using the Monte Carlo analysis with the aid of boxplots, confusion matrices, and classification plots. On average, the accuracy of the classification tree ML model performed better than the other algorithms, followed by Peter Swerling's statistical models and the discriminant analysis ML model. In general, the accuracy of the ML and SL algorithms outperformed the DL algorithms (Squeezenet, Googlenet, Nasnet, and Resnet 101) considered in the study. Furthermore, the computational time of each algorithm is analyzed. The study concludes that, while the SL algorithms achieved good recognition accuracy, the computational time was relatively long when compared to the ML and DL algorithms. Also, the study shows that the classification tree achieved the fastest average recognition time of about 0.46 ms.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Deep learning (DL); machine learning (ML); radar cross section (RCS); statistical learning (SL); target identification and recognition; unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)","Antennas; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Radar imaging; Radar target recognition; Signal to noise ratio; Space-based radar; Tracking radar; Trees (mathematics); Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Classification algorithm; Deep learning; Machine learning; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Radar cross-section; Radar cross-sections; Statistical learning; Target recognition; Target's identifications; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Radar cross section","","","","","","","Granshaw S.I., RPV, UAV, UAS, RPAS.or just drone?, Photogramm.

This study examines how these manufacturing defects affect the mechanical performance of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) AlSi10Mg specimens loaded in compression. Cylindrical samples of LPBF AlSi10Mg with varying levels of porosity and different microstructures were loaded in-situ in compression and characterized using X-ray computed tomography (XCT). Bulk porosity influenced the mechanical behavior of LPBF AlSi10Mg parts loaded in compression, with increasing porosity leading to decreasing yield strength, ultimate strength, and part ductility. However, bulk porosity did not influence the failure mode of the material during compression. Instead, microstructural changes caused by different heat treatments were the determining factor as to whether a part would fail via a critical shear crack or slowly collapse during loading. Data suggests that as bulk porosity increased, the strain required to propagate a crack from nucleation to catastrophic part failure also increased. Based on observations from XCT data, we hypothesize that large pores in the microstructure blunted the growing crack. These results suggest that, by increasing the resilience of LPBF AlSi10Mg parts loaded in compression, porosity may enhance certain desirable properties of LPBF parts during compressive loading. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; AlSi10Mg; Compression; Failure mechanisms; Heat treatment; Laser powder bed fusion; Microstructure; Porosity; Shear cracking","3D printers; Compressive strength; Computerized tomography; Cracks; Ductility; Failure (mechanical); Heat treatment; Porosity; Compression; Compression loading; Failure mechanism; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Part strength; Powder bed; Shear cracking; Strength and ductilities; X-ray computed tomography; Microstructure","","","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA, (DE-NA0003525); Sandia National Laboratories, SNL; Laboratory Directed Research and Development, LDRD","The authors would like to acknowledge Rand Garfield, James Griego, and Ben White for experimental support and expertise and insightful discussions.

These are commonly applied to gas metal arcs with metal transfer, in welding and additive manufacturing. Metal drop impact on the melt pool is thus included in this study. The electromagnetic force models applied in literature use either numerical solutions of Poisson equations or one of the two analytical models developed by Kou and Sun, or Tsao and Wu. These models rely on assumptions for which the effect on the melt pool predictions remains to be understood. The present work thoroughly investigates those assumptions and their effects. It has been supported by dedicated experimental tests that did provide estimates of unknown model parameters and validation data. The obtained results show that the assumptions that fundamentally distinguish these three models change the electromagnetic force, including the relation between its components. These changes, which can also be spatially non-uniform, are large. As a result, these models lead to significantly different recirculation flow pattern, thermal convection, melt pool morphology, bead dimensions, and free surface response to the metal transfer. We conclude by proposing conditions in which each of these models is suited or questionable. © 2022","Free surface oscillation; Gas metal arc; Kou and Sun model; Maxwell electromagnetic force model; Metal transfer; Molten pool; Tsao and Wu model","Computational fluid dynamics; Drops; Electric arcs; Heat convection; Metals; Morphology; Oscillating flow; Electromagnetic force model; Free surface oscillation; Free surfaces; Gas metal arcs; Kou and sun model; Maxwell electromagnetic force model; Metal transfers; Molten pool; Surface oscillations; Tsao and wu model; Flow patterns","","","","","European Commission, EC; Horizon 2020; National Supercomputer Centre, Linköpings Universitet, NSC","Funding text 1: This research work is supported by grants from the EU project - Horizon 2020: INTEGRADDE, which is gratefully acknowledged.

Because of titanium grade 5 limited formability at ambient temperature, forming operations on this material requires high temperatures. In these conditions, a peculiar microstructure evolves as a result of the heating and deformation cycles, which has a significant impact on formability and product quality. On the other hand, additive manufacturing technologies, such as selective laser melting and electron beam melting, are increasingly being used and are replacing more traditional approaches such as machining and forging. Fundamental part characteristics such as mechanical and microstructural properties, geometric accuracy, and surface quality strongly depend on the selection of the manufacturing method. The authors of this paper seek to identify the strengths and limitations imposed by the intrinsic characteristics of different manufacturing alternatives for the production of parts of aeronautical significance, providing guidelines for the choice of the most appropriate manufacturing route for a given application and part design. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Additive manufacturing; Geometrical accuracy; Hot forging; Machining; Ti grade5","Additives; Forging; Melting; Selective laser melting; Titanium alloys; Aircraft industries; Geometrical accuracy; High-strength; Highest temperature; Hot forging; Mechanical characterizations; Metal parts; Microstructural characterizations; Ti grade5; Titania; High strength alloys","","","","","Programa Operacional Temático Factores de Competitividade, POFC, (2017X52SLB)","This study was carried out using Italian MUR funds: “on the ChOice of Manufacturing Processes for Effective Titanium componEnts (COMPETE),” PRIN 2017 (2017X52SLB).","Banerjee D., Williams J.C., Perspectives on titanium science and technology, Acta Mater, (2013); Attar H., Ehtemam-Haghighi S., Kent D., Dargusch M.S., Recent developments and opportunities in additive manufacturing of titanium-based matrix composites: a review, Int J Mach Tools Manuf, 133, pp. 85-102, (2018); Blakey-Milner B., Gradl P., Snedden G., Brooks M., Pitot J., Lopez E., Leary M., Berto F., du Plessis A., Metal additive manufacturing in aerospace: a review, Mater Des, (2021); The Business Research Company, Aerospace Global Market Report 2021: COVID 19 Impact and Recovery to 2030, (2021); Wang Z.M., Ezugwu E.O., Performance of PVD-coated tools when machining Ti–6Al–4V, Tribol Trans, 40, pp. 81-87, (1997); Ezugwu E.O., da Silva R.B., Bonney J., Machado A.R., The effect of argon-enriched environment in high-speed machining of titanium alloy, Tribol Trans, 48, pp. 18-23, (2005); Wang B., Cheng L., Li D., Experimental study on forged TC4 titanium alloy fatigue properties under three-point bending and life prediction, Materials, (2021); Ducato A., Buffa G., Fratini L., Dual phase titanium alloy hot forging process design: experiments and numerical modeling, Adv Manuf, 3, pp. 269-281, (2015); Hu Z.M., Dean T.A., Aspects of forging of titanium alloys and the production of blade forms, J Mater Process Technol, 111, pp. 10-19, (2001); Hu Z.M., Brooks J.W., Dean T.A., Experimental and theoretical analysis of deformation and microstructural evolution in the hot-die forging of titanium alloy aerofoil sections, J Mater Process Technol, 88, pp. 251-265, (1999); Frazier W.E., Metal additive manufacturing: a review, J Mater Eng Perform, 23, pp. 1917-1928, (2014); Singoria V.K., Samsher S., Mechanism, characterization, pattern and effect of roughness over turbine blade: A review, Int J Eng Innov Technol, 2, (2013); Dutta B., Froes F.H.S., The additive manufacturing (AM) of titanium alloys, Met Powder Rep, 72, pp. 96-106, (2017); Nazemzadeh N., Soufivand A.A., Abolfathi N., Computing the bond strength of 3D printed polylactic acid scaffolds in mode I and II using experimental tests, finite element method and cohesive zone modeling, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 118, pp. 2651-2667, (2022); Ramosoeu M.E., Chikwanda H.K., Bolokang A.S., Booysen G., Ngonda T.N., Additive manufacturing: Characterization of TI-6AI-4V alloy intended for biomedical application 230(10):1781–1798.

In addition to the grain boundary peak PGB the Q−1 curves of both materials exhibit two other relaxation peaks, P1 (H = 0.8 ± 0.05 eV; τ0 = 10−11±1 s) and P2 (H = 1.0 ± 0.05 eV; τ0 = 10−13±1 s), depending on the interaction of dislocations with solute elements (Si and Mg). Relaxation strengths of P1, P2 and PGB of AM alloy are greater than those of the AC one owing to the finer structure of Al cells and the higher amount of Si and Mg in supersaturated solid solution induced by the rapid solidification typical of the L-PBF process. After successive MS test runs relaxation strengths of P1 and P2 peaks in both the examined materials decrease due to the precipitation of Si atoms and dislocation density recovery. Such decrease is more pronounced in AM alloy where change of cell shape and increase of cell size is observed. Dynamic modulus of AM alloy exhibits an anomalous trend in the first test run that is no more present in successive runs. The irreversible process giving rise to such anomalous behavior is the closure of pores of nanometric size. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; AlSi10Mg; Casting; Electron microscopy; Mechanical spectroscopy; Microstructure; XRD","3D printers; Additives; Electron microscopes; Electron microscopy; Rapid solidification; Silicon; Statistical mechanics; X ray diffraction; Additive manufacturing technology; As-cast; Grain-boundaries; Laser powders; Mechanical spectroscopy; Powder bed; Relaxation peak; Relaxation strength; Test runs; XRD; Grain boundaries","","","","","Department of Industrial Engineering – University of Rome","The authors are grateful to Mr. Piero Plini of Department of Industrial Engineering – University of Rome “Tor Vergata” for assistance in the preparation of samples used in MS tests.","Aboulkhair N.T., Simonelli M., Parry L., Ashcroft I., Tuck C., Hague R., 3D printing of aluminium alloys: additive manufacturing of aluminium alloys using selective laser melting, Prog.

However, the manufacturing of complex active SMA honeycomb arrays via conventional processes is a difficult task, and the actuation performance of the honeycomb arrays has not yet been well–investigated. In this work, the active SMA honeycomb arrays were fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM) additive manufacturing, and their actuation performance was investigated. The results show that the SLM–fabricated active SMA honeycomb arrays can generate obvious actuation performance during the transformation and exhibit a higher maximum actuation stress of 2.53 MPa at a R/t ratio of 4 and a tensile pre–strain of 35%. This research will contribute to the design and further improvement of active SMA honeycomb arrays based on SLM additive manufacturing, promoting the engineering applications for smart morphing wings. © 2022 by the authors.","actuation performance; additive manufacturing; honeycomb arrays; shape-memory alloy; smart morphing wings","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51921003, 51975292); Outstanding Youth Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China, (BK20211519); State Key Laboratory of Mechanics and Control of Mechanical Structures, SKLMCMS, (MCMS-I-0521K01)","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51921003, 51975292) and the Outstanding Youth Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China (Grant No. BK20211519).

One of the potential ways is hybrid deposition manufacturing (HDM) that includes fused filament fabrication (FFF) with the conventional filling process, also known as “HDM composites"". HDM is a potential technique for improving structural stability by replacing the thermoplastic void structure with a voidless epoxy. However, the literature lacks investigation of FFF/epoxy HDM-based composites regarding optimal volume distribution, effects of brittle and ductile FFF materials, and fractographic analysis. This research presents the effects of range of volume distributions (10–90%) between FFF and epoxy system for tensile, flexure, and compressive characterization. Volume distribution in tensile and flexure samples is achieved using printable wall thickness, slot width, and maximum width. For compression, the printable wall thickness, slot diameter, and external diameter are considered. Polylactic acid and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene are used to analyze the brittle and ductile FFF structures. The research reports novel application of image analysis during mechanical characterization using high-quality camera and fractographic analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results present surprising high tensile strain (0.038 mm/mm) and compressive strength (64.5 MPa) for lower FDM-percentages (10%, 20%) that are explained using in situ image analysis, SEM, stress–strain simulations, and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). In this regard, the proposed work holds novelty to apply DMA for HDM. The optimal volume distributions of 70% and 80% alongside fractographic mechanisms for lower percentages (10%, 20%) can potentially contribute to structural applications and future material-based innovations for HDM. © 2022, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; Dynamic mechanical analysis; Fused filament fabrication; Hybrid deposition manufacturing; In situ image analysis; Mechanical characterization; Scanning electron microscopy","Additives; Compressive strength; Deposition; Dynamics; Fabrication; Fused Deposition Modeling; Image analysis; Mechanisms; Quality control; Stability; Styrene; Tensile strain; Epoxy; Fractographic analysis; Fused filament fabrication; Hybrid deposition; Hybrid deposition manufacturing; Image-analysis; In situ image analyse; Mechanical characterizations; Volume distributions; Wall thickness; Scanning electron microscopy","","","","","Massey University; King Saud University, KSU, (RSP-2021/256)","Funding text 1: The authors are thankful to King Saud University for funding this work through Researchers Supporting Project number (RSP-2021/256), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

This work is focused on exploring the use of Ground Tire Rubber (GTR) in a new class of cost-effective, recycled composite materials. A Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) desktop 3D printer is used to produce GTR-based composite material with up to 50% wt. rubber filling. ABS is used as the host matrix. Both microscopic and macroscopic characterization of the 3D printed composites are performed in addition to a baseline printed composite. Increasing the rubber content from 0 % wt. to 50 % wt. in the 3D printed GTR-based composite results in approximately 260% improvement in the overall damping properties. Results also indicate the average diameter of the rubber particles in the 3D printed composites increased as the amount of rubber content increased. Presumably, specimens with larger rubber particles yielded longer contact lines with the host polymeric matrix. Consequently, energy dissipation is improved, resulting in enhanced overall damping properties of the 3D printed composites. The enhanced damping capabilities as well as the low-production cost and lightweight characteristics of the presented GTR-filled composite yield new opportunity for application of these GTR-reinforced composites in automotive or other industries for making a wide variety of parts where these characteristics are highly valuable. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3D printing; ABS; Circular economy; Ground tire rubber (GTR); GTR-Reinforced composite; Recycling waste tires; Waste management of tires","3D printers; Cost effectiveness; Damping; Energy dissipation; Plastic recycling; Reinforcement; Tires; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; ABS; Circular economy; Ground tire rubber; Ground tire rubber-reinforced composite; Ground tyre rubber; Recycling waste tire; Recycling wastes; Reinforced composites; Waste management of tire; Waste tires; Waste management","","","","","Board of Regents Support Fund, (OIA-1946231-CFDA #47.083); Louisiana Board of Regents-National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation, NSF, (2153263, 80NSSC20M0110, LEQSF(2020–24); Office of Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, EPSCoR; Louisiana Space Grant Consortium; Bureau of Reclamation, USBR; Louisiana Board of Regents","Funding text 1: This work was partially supported by National Science Foundation- Office Of International Science &Engineering-International Research Experience for Undergraduates (IRES) program Award# 2153263, Louisiana Board of Regents- National Science Foundation (BoR/NSF) Grant and Cooperative Agreement Number [ 80NSSC20M0110 ], Louisiana Board of Regents Support Fund contract number [LEQSF(2020–24)-LaSPACE], and Louisiana Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research ( EPSCoR ) funded by the National Science Foundation and the Board of Regents Support Fund under Cooperative Agreement Number [OIA-1946231-CFDA #47.083].

The exterior of the building was designed as an irregular shape of curtain wall, and it had a challenge that the existing methods could not address the requirement. The GDS curtain wall comprises different flat glass shapes connected by varying deflection angles. This structural requirement caused unprecedented challenges, such as the vertex deflection phenomenon. The proposed method, named the Smart Node system, was developed and applied to the GDS project to address this challenge. Additive manufacturing (AM) technology was used in production, showing a novel method for irregular façade construction. The originality of this study is to accomplish a new construction method using the AM technology, and also it covers the quantified effect of this application. One of the key achievements is that the developed Smart Note system performed with 99.4% construction accuracy, where only 10 out of 1652 glass sheets required reworks or corrections. In addition, the analysis found that the length of the vertical span was identified as one of the most critical factors to prevent construction error(s). When the length of the section is less than 9.8 m, no construction issues were observed. The main contribution of this study lies in the accuracy level of construction delivery, which is 647 node and 1632 glass panel productions and installations. The novelty of this study also includes the qualitative description of practical trials and errors from carrying out an AM-applied construction of GDS's exterior façade. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Irregular façade; Node system; Offsite construction","Additives; Facades; Glass; Walls (structural partitions); 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Additive manufacturing technology; Building facades; Curtain-walls; Irregular buildings; Irregular facade; Node system; Off-site construction; Smart nodes; 3D printers","","","","","Australia-Korea Foundation of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, (AKF2018003); Australian Government","This project is a part of “Innovation in Construction Automation & Technologies” sponsored by the Australian Government through the Australia-Korea Foundation of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade .
