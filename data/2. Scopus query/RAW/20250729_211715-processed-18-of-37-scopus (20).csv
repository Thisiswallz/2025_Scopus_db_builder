Furthermore, there is a need to decrease the ecological footprint of printable concrete. As a possible solution for these challenges, this paper presents a 3D-printable strain-hardening alkali-activated composite (3DP-SHAAC) that shows pseudo-ductile behaviour under direct tension. The developed 3DP-SHAAC is composed of a one-part (just-add-water) alkali-activated binder made of slag (GGBFS), fly ash (FA) and solid activators. The one-part alkali-activated binder eliminates the need for elevated temperature curing and handling of corrosive alkaline liquids. At first, an optimum matrix was identified by studying the effects of FA to GGBFS ratio on the rheological properties and compressive strength. Subsequently, the optimum matrix was reinforced by PVA fibres to make the 3DP-SHAAC, and printing performance and rheological properties were evaluated. In addition, the influences of curing temperature on the compressive, flexural and tensile performances of the printed specimens were also investigated. The results were compared with those obtained for the mould-cast specimens. The 3DP-SHAAC exhibited superior flexural performance, higher tensile strength, and comparable tensile strain capacity to the mould-cast counterpart. Further, the curing temperature had influence on the mechanical properties of both 3D-printed and mould-cast SHAACs. The underlying reasons for the differences are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3D-concrete-printing; Mechanical properties; Rheological properties; Strain-hardening; Strain-hardening alkali-activated composite","3D printers; Compressive strength; Concretes; Curing; Fly ash; Reinforcement; Rheology; Slags; Tensile strain; Tensile strength; 3d-concrete-printing; Alkali-activated; Alkali-activated binder; Concrete printings; Curing temperature; Flexural performance; matrix; One parts; Rheological property; Strain-hardening alkali-activated composite; Strain hardening","","","","","Universities Australia and German Academic Exchange Service; Australian Research Council, ARC","This project was supported by the Discovery Project DP210101680 , Discovery Early Career Researcher Award DE180101587 and Linkage Infrastructure Grant LE170100168 , funded by the Australian Research Council , as well as the 2018 Australia–Germany Joint Research Co-operation Scheme grant funded by Universities Australia and German Academic Exchange Service .","Khoshnevis B., Automated construction by contour crafting—related robotics and information technologies, Autom.

This makes them attractive candidates for components that provide crash or impact protection (such as crumple zones) in automotive and aerospace applications. However, little prior work on the effect of boundary constraint on the behaviour of these structures exists. Therefore, the primary goal of this investigation is to assess the effect of boundary constraint on the energy-absorbing properties of auxetic metamaterials. Specifically, auxetic metamaterials (lattice structures) were fabricated from stainless steel powders via 3-D laser printing (selective laser melting). Additional structures were printed with constraining walls attached in order to evaluate the effects of boundary constraint on the auxetic behaviour. A comprehensive investigation of the mechanical performance of the structures was then carried out under both quasi-static and dynamic (impact) loading conditions. Poisson's ratio and elastic modulus values were determined from the experimental results and compared with theoretical calculations. Dissipation of vertical forces into the lateral boundaries was confirmed by about 20% less negative Poisson's ratios, for otherwise identical auxetic structures. In addition, dynamic loading simulations have shown that with optimized geometric parameters, auxetic metamaterials are capable absorbing over 90% of the energy of an impact. However, critical overestimation of the energy absorbing abilities of auxetic crash protectors could occur if the effects of lateral constraint are not carefully considered. © 2022 The Author(s)","3-D printing; Auxetics; Impact testing; Metamaterial; Re-entrant unit cell; Selective laser melting","Aerospace applications; Dynamic loads; Energy absorption; Energy dissipation; Mechanical testing; Melting; Metamaterials; Poisson ratio; Selective laser melting; 3-D printing; Auxetics; Boundary constraints; Dynamic impacts; Energy; Impact loadings; Negative Poisson ratio; Re-entrant unit cell; Selective laser melting; Unit cells; Impact testing","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (EXC-2193/1 – 390951807); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; National Institute for Materials Science, NIMS, (PD3020); National Institute for Materials Science, NIMS","This investigation was partly supported by the National Institute for Materials Science , Tsukuba, Japan (Project Number PD3020).

In this study, substrate preheating (200 °C) was proposed as a solution to achieve high thermal conductivities in the as-built condition. Pure Al, AlSi12, and AlSi10Mg samples were shown to possess up to 15 %, 25 %, and 80 % higher thermal conductivity values than their non-preheated counterparts reported in the literature. An analytical analysis contingent on calculating electron mean free path in the presence of only intrinsic or a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic scattering phenomena was introduced to justify the thermal behaviors. As per micro X-ray computed tomography, EBSD analysis, and TEM investigations, the extrinsic scattering sites were found to be (i) pores, (ii) grain boundaries, (iii) cell boundaries (Al alloys), (iv) oxides (pure Al), (v) nano-size Si precipitates (AlSi10Mg), (vi) nano-size Mg2Si phase (AlSi10Mg), (vii) vacancies, (viii) dislocations and (ix) Si supersaturation in α-Al phase (Al alloys). The dominant scattering site(s) was found for each material based on which the difference between the obtained thermal conductivity and its corresponding nominal value or the one reported for the non-preheated condition was unraveled. The implications of the findings in this study are essential not only for Al/Al alloys but also for other metallic materials (i.e., Cu alloys), requiring high thermal conductivity in the as-built condition. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","AlSi12 and AlSi10Mg alloys; Electron mean free paths; Pure aluminum; TEM investigation of nano-constituents; Thermal diffusivity and conductivity","Computerized tomography; Copper alloys; Fabrication; Grain boundaries; Heat treatment; Magnesium alloys; Preheating; Silicon; Silicon alloys; Substrates; Alsi12 and alsi10mg alloy; Condition; Electron mean-free path; High thermal conductivity; Laser powders; Nano-size; Powder bed; Pure aluminium; Pure aluminum; TEM investigation of nano-constituent; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Center for Advanced Nuclear Systems; Linseis Messgeraete GmbH; WMT&R) Inc.; Westmoreland-Mechanical Testing & Research; McMaster University","This study and the science behind it would not have been possible without the support of Linseis Messgeraete GmbH, Selb, Germany, especially Erika Hahn, where thermal diffusivity measurements were performed.

In this work, a high-fidelity multiphysics model is developed at powder-scale that unidirectionally couples the powder spattering and laser welding simulation to study the spattering and porosity formation mechanism in laser powder bed fusion process. Vapor pressure from single-track laser welding simulation is applied as a moving boundary condition in a discrete element model to simulate particle spattering. Then, coupling simulation between the mass particles and laser welding is performed to study the interaction between melt pool and spattering particles. Two porosity formation mechanisms are observed in experiments and simulation. The first one is the spattering particles falling into melt pool directly and leaving un-melted or partially melted pores to the final product. The second mechanism is the particles near the melt track that are dragged to the melt pool bead and partially melted due to heat conduction.

There are challenges in how to design a substitute that fits the undamaged part and design a biomimetic structure for the trabecular bone structure. Traditional autologous bone transplantation for maxillofacial defect repair is complex and has a long recovery time, which may cause secondary damage to the human body. In addition, the substitute’s appearance has poor consistency, lacks aesthetics, and affects functional recovery. In this paper, an integrated bionic porous ceramic maxillofacial prosthesis was designed and fabricated by digital light processing (DLP) based on the Voronoi-Tessellation principle for regional defects of the human mandible. The simulation results showed that the mandible stress is distributed symmetrically, and the graft of the unilateral prefabricated reconstruction plate and maxillofacial prosthesis effectively balanced the stress transfer during the occlusion process. The maximum stress on the undamaged mandible appeared between the condyle and coracoid, with little difference between the left and right sides. The maximum stress value in the reconstruction plate near the maxillofacial prosthesis reached 42.61 MPa. The rest of the stress was mostly lower than 20 MPa. Moreover, the deformation of maxillofacial prosthesis is relatively small, which was not enough to destroy its safety and stability. The proposed method can effectively reduce the surgical trauma and postoperative impact on the leg, significantly shorten the operation time, and improve the restoration effect of the teeth. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","","3D printers; Biomimetics; Bionics; Bone; Defects; Plates (structural components); Repair; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Biomimetic structures; Bone transplantation; Defect repair; Human bones; Maximum stress; Porous ceramics; Reconstruction plates; Trabecular bone structures; Maxillofacial prostheses","","","","","Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of NUAA, (xcxjh20210512); Jiangsu Provincial Key Research and Development Program, (BE2019002); Jiangsu Provincial Key Research and Development Program","Funding text 1: This work was supported by Jiangsu Provincial Key Research and Development Program (No. BE2019002) and Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of NUAA (No. xcxjh20210512).

Recently, exploiting the heterogeneities in sub-grain cellular structure and associated micromechanical response has been considered as a novel strategy to achieve unprecedented mechanical properties of AM-fabricated parts. In-depth understanding of such heterogeneities is critical for AM process control and optimization. In this work, laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) of a Ti-35Nb alloy is investigated with focus on unravelling and controlling the heterogeneities in site-specific cellular structure and associated micromechanical response. The experimental results reveal significant changes in such heterogeneities across the melt pool as affected by LPBF conditions. For in-depth investigation, a computational framework integrating a finite element thermal model, a phase-field grain growth model and a crystal plasticity micromechanical model is developed. The integrated experimental and computational effort is utilized to investigate the process-microstructure-property relationship at the sub-grain scale. In specific, the effects of process-induced thermal conditions on sub-grain cellular structure, thereby micromechanical response, are investigated. Spatial distribution maps of cell size and microhardness are constructed to demonstrate the heterogeneities within the melt pool. The roles of individual processing parameters on the spatial control of sub-grain cellular structure and micromechanical response are evaluated. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Crystal plasticity; Laser powder bed fusion; Micromechanical response; Phase-field modeling; Sub-grain cellular structure","3D printers; Binary alloys; Cellular automata; Crystal structure; Grain growth; Niobium alloys; Plasticity; Process control; Titanium alloys; Cellular structure; Crystal plasticity; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Melt pool; Micro-mechanical; Micromechanical response; Phase field models; Powder bed; Sub-grain cellular structure; Additives","","","","","College of Engineering at the University of Nevada, Reno; College of Engineering, Temple University","Y.

However, it may cause undesired manufacturing-induced defects/cracks due to high thermal residual stresses. This study proposes a PeriDynamics-enabled three-dimensional Topology Optimization method (PD-TO) for designing structures by considering surface cracks for the AM processes. The PD-TO approach employs a bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization method and uses particle discretization of geometry for mechanical analysis. Crack surfaces are generated by breaking three-dimensional nonlocal interactions of the particles, and thus, during the optimization process, complex multiple structural discontinuities can be diligently modeled. First, the proposed approach is validated by solving benchmark problems without cracks. For each benchmark geometry, the PD-TO analysis is then performed by considering different positions and numbers (single/multiple) of cracks. These analyses extensively investigate and demonstrate the effects of a priori knowledge of residual stress-induced damages/cracks on the optimum topology for additive manufacturing. Besides, the smoothing operation is applied to the optimum designs to transform voxel shapes into AM-friendly smooth surfaces. These geometries are manufactured by an extrusion-based AM process to demonstrate the practical engineering application of the proposed method. Finally, the comparison of numerical results is also supported by the experimental tests conducted on the optimized topologies. Overall, it is confirmed that the PD-TO approach is a viable and accurate optimization tool for additive manufacturing considering possible process-induced damages. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Lightweight design; Peridynamics; Surface cracks; Three-dimensional high resolution; Topology optimization","Additives; Continuum mechanics; Cracks; Geometry; Residual stresses; Shape optimization; Structural optimization; Surface defects; Surface stress; Topology; Additive manufacturing process; High resolution; Lightweight design; Manufacturing IS; Optimization approach; Peridynamics; Surface cracks; Three-dimensional high resolution; Three-dimensional structure; Topology optimisation; 3D printers","","","","","Canada Research Chairs; Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu, TÜBİTAK, (218M712, 218M713)","The financial support provided by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) under grant Numbers: 218M712 , and 218M713 is greatly acknowledged.

The influence of binder saturation (15–100 %), roller traverse speed (10–110 mm/sec), layer thickness (30–90 µm), and sintering atmosphere (vacuum, argon, hydrogen) on the quality of aluminum printed parts has been investigated. The study included the density, shrinkage, porosity, surface topography, and roughness of printed, and sintered aluminum parts. An anisotropy of linear contraction in the X, Y, and Z directions was observed, with the largest linear shrinkage occurring in the Z direction. In terms of roughness, the top surfaces (XY direction) turned out to be the smoothest and the side surfaces (YZ direction) were the roughest. Samples that were sintered under vacuum resulted in higher density, lower shrinkage, and lower porosity compared to those sintered in argon or hydrogen. On the basis of results, it was found that generally, increasing the saturation level and layer thickness causes a decrease in density and increases the shrinkage and the porosity of additive manufactured parts. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Irregular particles; Shrinkage; Sintering; Surface topography","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum; Argon; Hydrogen; Porosity; Shrinkage; Surface roughness; Topography; 3D printing process; Feedstock powders; Irregular particle; Jetting technology; Layer thickness; Optimisations; Process parameters; Properties of Al; Shrinkage porosity; Z-directions; Sintering","","","","","","","Del Giudice L., Vassiliou M.F., Mechanical properties of 3D printed material with binder jet technology and potential applications of additive manufacturing in seismic testing of structures, Addit.

The effects of initial prior β microstructure and subsequent solution treatment and aging (STA) on mechanical properties have been investigated. In all cases, the increase of solution temperature and aging treatment improve the strength due to solution-strengthening and precipitation-strengthening. It is confirmed that the L-PBF hereditary basket-weave microstructure possesses better tensile properties than other microstructures, with an ultimate tensile strength of 1185 ± 6 MPa and an elongation of 15.3 ± 0.3%. The optimal tensile properties stem from the fine structured primary α and transformed β phases in the retained L-PBF prior β grains, which are both beneficial to improving the work-hardening capacity, as well as enhancing the resistance to crack initiation and propagation. This finding can guide the optimization of mechanical properties for the L-PBF additive manufactured Ti6Al4V components. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Heat treatment; Laser powder bed fusion; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Ti6Al4V","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Heat treatment; Strain hardening; Tensile strength; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Basket weave microstructure; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Length scale; Matchings; Microstructural features; Post heat-treatment; Post-heat treatment; Powder bed; Solution-aging; Microstructure","","","","","IMR Innovation Foundation, (2021-PY05); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51871223, 52130002); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, YIPA CAS, (2021192); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, YIPA CAS; K.

Methods: DLP (digital light processing)-printed specimens produced from Nextdent crown & bridge (C&B) resins were washed separately using an ultrasonic bath and rotary washer with TPM (tripropylene glycol monomethyl ether) for 3 min, 6 min, 10 min, 20 min, and 1 h. Postcuring was applied for 30 min to each specimen after the washing process. The flexural strength, Vickers hardness, water sorption and solubility, degree of conversion (DC), elution of residual monomers, and biocompatibility of the specimens were evaluated. Results: The ultrasonic bath showed greater washing efficacy by reducing the residual HEMA (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) from 2.0634 ppm to 0.1456 ppm and reducing the residual TEGDMA (triethylene glycol dimethacrylate) from 1.4862 ppm to 0.1484 ppm. With prolonged washing, the flexural strength significantly decreased from 129.67 ± 6.66 MPa (mean±standard deviation) to 103.17 ± 7.20 MPa, while the Vickers hardness increased slightly for the first 6 min and then decreased thereafter significantly. The DC was 87.78 ± 1.34% after 3 min and then gradually decreased with extended washing time. The cytotoxicity significantly decreases with the increment of the washing time. Significance: The washing effect on the elution of residual monomers was better for an ultrasonic bath than for a rotary washer. Extending the washing time reduces the mechanical properties and cytotoxicity of the Nextdent C&B resin. © 2022","3D printing; Degree of conversion; Mechanical properties; Photopolymer resin; Postwashing; Ultrasonic","Composite Resins; Crowns; Ethers; Materials Testing; Methacrylates; Polyethylene Glycols; Polymethacrylic Acids; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Water; 3D printers; Bending strength; Biocompatibility; Domestic appliances; Glycols; Monomers; Resins; Washing; 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate; ether derivative; macrogol; methacrylic acid; polymethacrylic acid derivative; resin; triethylene glycol dimethacrylate; water; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Bridge materials; Degree of conversion; Photopolymer resins; Postwashing; Residual monomers; Ultrasonic bath; Vicker hardness; Washing time; materials testing; three dimensional printing; tooth crown; Vickers hardness","","2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 868-77-9; macrogol, 25322-68-3; methacrylic acid, 18358-13-9, 79-41-4; triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 109-16-0; water, 7732-18-5; Composite Resins, ; Ethers, ; hydroxyethyl methacrylate, ; Methacrylates, ; Polyethylene Glycols, ; Polymethacrylic Acids, ; triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, ; Water, ","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (NRF- 2021R1C1C1012183); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT ( MSIT ) (NRF- 2021R1C1C1012183 ).","Ngo T.D., Kashani A., Imbalzano G., Nguyen K.T.Q., Hui D., Additive manufacturing (3D printing): a review of materials, methods, applications and challenges, Compos Part B Eng, 143, pp. 172-196, (2018); Ventola C.L., Medical applications for 3D printing: current and projected uses, Pharm Ther, 39, 10, pp. 704-711, (2014); Ligon S.C., Liska R., Stampfl J., Gurr M., Mulhaupt R., Polymers for 3D printing and customized additive manufacturing, Chem Rev, 117, 15, pp. 10212-10290, (2017); Yan C., Shi Y., Yang J., Liu J., Multiphase polymeric materials for rapid prototyping and tooling technologies and their applications, Compos Interfaces, 17, 2-3, pp. 257-271, (2010); Arefin A.M.E., Khatri N.R., Kulkarni N., Egan P.F., Polymer 3D printing review: materials, process, and design strategies for medical applications, Polymers, 13, 9, (2021); Stansbury J.W., Idacavage M.J., 3D printing with polymers: challenges among expanding options and opportunities, Dent Mater, 32, 1, pp. 54-64, (2016); Worthington M.L., (2010); Li X., Xie B., Jin J., Chai Y., Chen Y., 3D printing temporary crown and bridge by temperature controlled mask image projection stereolithography, Procedia Manuf, 26, pp. 1023-1033, (2018); Kristi A., Newman S.M., Bowman C.N., Polymeric dental composites: properties and reaction behavior of multimethacrylate dental restorations, Biopolym.II.

This noise control solution consists of metal 3D printed resonant elements applied to the rear wheel arches of a vehicle and is designed as a potential alternative to the commonly used dynamic damper solutions, which are typically installed on the suspension or the vehicle body in case of a severe noise issue. The objective of the resonant metamaterial design is (i) to reduce the structural energy propagation and, in turn, the acoustic energy radiated into the vehicle, (ii) and to be manufactured with metal 3D printing in view of being readily integrable in structural body parts. Numerical energy flow and vibro-acoustic predictions, and experimental vibro-acoustic analyses show how metal 3D printed resonant metamaterials can be a potential performant and fully integrable lightweight alternative to the common noise and vibration solutions for structure-borne tyre noise control in vehicles. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Acoustic tyre resonances; Automotive NVH; Metal 3D printing; Resonant metamaterials; Structure-borne noise","3D printers; Acoustic noise; Acoustic wave propagation; Acoustics; Automobile bodies; Automotive industry; Metals; Metamaterials; Vibration analysis; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Acoustic tire resonance; Automotive NVH; Automotives; Lower frequencies; Metal 3d printing; Resonant metamaterial; Structure-borne noise; Tire noise; Tires","","","","","","","Redelbach M., Klotzke M., Friedrich H.E., Impact of lightweight design on energy consumption and cost effectiveness of alternative powertrain concepts, European Electric Vehicle Conference, (2012); Scelsi L., Bonner M., Hodzic A., Soutis C., Wilson C., Scaife R., Ridgway K., Potential emissions savings of lightweight composite aircraft components evaluated through life cycle assessment, Express Polym.

Such capabilities hold great promise to significantly improve the producibility, repeatability, and reproducibility of the additive manufacturing process and unlock its complete design freedom for product innovation. This paper defines the concept of intelligent additive manufacturing and design (IAMD) while providing a triple-layer model for reference. Details about these three layers, i.e., digital thread layer, cyber-physical layer, and intelligent service layer, are presented. Moreover, both scientific and engineering challenges raised during the studies and implementations of IAMD are discussed together with potential solutions. The paper also outlines the future perspective on IAMD towards the directions of integrated design and manufacturing, cyber-physical AM, advanced artificial intelligence for AM, digital materials and products, as well as design for AM process chain. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Cyber-physical system; Integrated design and manufacturing; Intelligent manufacturing","Additives; Cyber Physical System; Decision making; Design for manufacturability; Embedded systems; Network layers; Product design; Additive manufacturing process; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber physicals; Cyber-physical systems; Design state; Future perspectives; Integrated designs; Integrated manufacturing; Intelligent Manufacturing; State of the art; 3D printers","","","","","National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF, (A19E10097); National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52105261); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFB1715400); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","Funding text 1: X.Y. acknowledges the National Key Research and Development Program of China [Grant No. 2021YFB1715400 ] and National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant No. 52105261 ].

Herein, we propose 3D printing of a biomimetic epithelium/stroma bilayer implant for corneal regeneration. Gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) and long-chain poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) are blended to form a two-component ink, which can be printed to different mechanically robust programmed PEGDA-GelMA objects by Digital Light Processing (DLP) printing technology, due to the toughening effect of crystalline crosslinks from long-chain PEGDA on GelMA hydrogel after photo-initiated copolymerization. The printed PEGDA-GelMA hydrogels support cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, meanwhile demonstrating a high light transmittance, and an appropriate swelling degree, nutrient permeation and degradation rate. A bi-layer dome-shaped corneal scaffold consisting of rabbit corneal epithelial cells (rCECs)-laden epithelia layer and rabbit adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (rASCs)-laden orthogonally aligned fibrous stroma layer can be printed out with a high fidelity and robustly surgical handling ability. This bi-layer cells-laden corneal scaffold is applied in a rabbit keratoplasty model. The post-operative outcome reveals efficient sealing of corneal defects, re-epithelialization and stromal regeneration. The concerted effects of microstructure of 3D printed corneal scaffold and precisely located cells in epithelia and stroma layer provide an optimal topographical and biological microenvironment for corneal regeneration. © 2022 The Authors","3D printing; Bi-layer scaffold; Corneal regeneration; Hydrogel","biomimetic material; gelatin; hydrogel; methacrylic acid; molecular scaffold; adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cell adhesion; cell culture; cell migration; cell proliferation; chemical structure; controlled study; cornea; epithelium; epithelization; flow kinetics; gene expression; histology; immunofluorescence assay; keratoplasty; Leporidae; mouse; MTT assay; nonhuman; permeability; polymerization; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; regeneration; slit lamp microscopy; stroma; swelling; three dimensional printing; wound healing assay","","gelatin, 9000-70-8; methacrylic acid, 18358-13-9, 79-41-4","AVANCE III, Bruker","Bruker","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51733006); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFA0703100); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support for this work from National Key Research and Development Program (Grant No. 2018YFA0703100 ) and National Nature Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51733006 ).

It significantly affects almost every aspect of part fabrication, from part properties and dimensional accuracy to print cost and time. This works implements a Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) based algorithm to generate a toolpath for efficient and accurate area filling with a minimum number of tool retractions and 'number of turns.' The toolpath generation process starts by first digitizing the layer being processed, i.e., given a geometric contour, a series of grid points (analogous to cities) within the boundary is generated. A deposition head sequentially traverses these grid points, filling the entire area with no voids (or porosity). A detailed investigation of the digitization process, exploring the rectangular and circular array of grid points, has been presented, which further elaborates the effect of digitization on the toolpath. A novel method of reducing the number of turns in a toolpath by appropriately positioning the grid points is highlighted in the present work. The proposed path planning method is capable of orienting the toolpath such that the deposited track (or the scan lines) favors one direction of motion over the other. Finally, an account of the successful implementation of the proposed strategy in an FDM and WAAM-based printer is also presented as a part of the study. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Area-filling method; Non-retractable toolpath; Toolpath planning; Traveling salesman problem","3D printers; Additives; Filling; Motion planning; Area filling; Area-filling method; Digitisation; Filling methods; Grid points; Non-retractable toolpath; Problem solvers; Property; Tool paths planning; Toolpaths; Traveling salesman problem","","","","","IIT Guwahati Research & Development, (xxMESUGIITG01305xSJK001)","The authors acknowledge Technology Innovation Hub IIT Guwahati and Start-Up Research Grant, IIT Guwahati Research & Development, for their financial support for project no. xxMESUGIITG01305xSJK001 titled “Design and Development of a Micro-Cladding-Based Metal 3D Printer.”","Jiang J., Ma Y., Path planning strategies to optimize accuracy, quality, build time and material use in additive manufacturing: a review, Micromachines, 11, (2020); Qu X., Stucker B., Raster milling tool-path generation from STL files, Rapid Prototyp.

Recently, in the application of 3D printing, composite consumables have been increasingly used when various fillers are added to traditional polymers, metals, and ceramics, improving printed products’ performance properties. In addition, numerous studies have shown that the quality of manufactured parts depends on many variables of the process of 3D printing. Experimental study of the influence of fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing process parameters, such as stacking orientation and thickness of printing layers, on the mechanical characteristics of specimens made of composite monofilaments based on PLA-Cg+ (with 5% layered graphite filling) and PLA-CCF (with the introduction of 10% carbon fibers into PLA plastic) under compression. Two parameters of the 3D printing process, the stacking orientation, and the print layer thickness were investigated for their effect on the mechanical properties of the PLA+graphite specimens printed by fused deposition using compression tests. The experiments were performed according to the design of a complete factorial experiment 32//9 (two factors at three levels, nine tests in total). The analysis of the experimental data showed that both the stacking orientation and the thickness of the printed layer significantly influence the mechanical properties of the specimens of both materials. Regression models describing the influence of the process parameters on the Young modulus and the proportionality limit of the specimens were developed. The results show that both the proportionality limit and the elastic modulus of the printed PLA-Cg+ specimens increase with decreasing thickness of the printed layer. At a layer thickness of 0.1 mm, the specimens with the filament deposition direction coinciding with the loading direction have the best mechanical performance. When the loading axis is at an angle to the direction of filament deposition, the specimens have lower values of proportionality and stiffness. The relationships between the process parameters and mechanical characteristics of PLA-CCF specimens are more complex. The results provide a basis for a systematic evaluation of the mechanical characteristics of FDM-printed polymers and potential ways to select process parameters to improve the quality of the final parts © 2023, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","3D printing; additive manufacturing; compression testing; mechanical properties; PLA-CCF; surfacing modeling, PLA-Cg+","3D modeling; Compression testing; Fused Deposition Modeling; Graphite; Layered manufacturing; Quality control; Regression analysis; 3-D printing; 3D printing process; 3D-printing; Layer thickness; Mechanical characteristics; PLA-CCF; Poly lactide; Process parameters; Stacking orientation; Surfacing modeling, PLA-cg+; Deposition","","","","","","","Zadpoor A.A., Malda J., Additive manufacturing of biomaterials, tissues, and organs, Annals Biomedical Eng., 45, 1, pp. 1-11, (2017); Jimenez L., Mena M.J., Prendiz J., Et al., Polylactic acid (PLA) as a bioplastic and its possible applications in the food industry, J.

Their performance, however, can be shifted to the next level by the application of post-processing, advantageously via intensive plastic deformation. The study characterizes the effects of rotary swaging performed at hot, cold, and cryogenic conditions on the (sub)structure and mechanical properties of workpieces of AISI 316 L stainless steel, favourably used in constructions as well as medicine, manufactured by PBF. The workpieces built in the horizontal and vertical directions were analysed to assess their structures, residual strain and stress, density, and porosity; porosity was observed primarily in the horizontally built workpiece also featuring lower density and larger average grain size. Subsequently, the workpieces were subjected to rotary swaging, which contributed to (almost) complete elimination of porosity, evident substructure development, and significant grain refinement – the vertically built workpiece exhibited the avg. grain size of 2.3 µm, 1.8 µm, and 0.1 µm after hot, cold, and cryo swaging. The cryo-swaged sample also exhibited specific texture, room temperature ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of more than 2 000 MPa, and two times higher microhardness compared to the as-build workpiece. All the swaged pieces exhibited significantly improved mechanical properties, even at the testing temperature of 900 °C. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","AISI 316 L; Microstructure; Powder bed fusion; Rotary swaging; Stainless steel","Austenitic stainless steel; Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; Shear flow; Tensile strength; Textures; 316 L stainless steel; AISI 316; AISI 316 L; Performance; Post process; Post-processing; Powder bed; Powder bed fusion; Rotary swaging; Workpiece; Porosity","","","","","LaPaMat laboratory team, (LR-0); Grantová Agentura České Republiky, GA ČR, (LM2018111)","Funding text 1: The works was supported from the Project no. 22–11949S by the Czech Science Foundation.

Furthermore, in real-life decision-making situations, individuals are always bounded rationality, which is clearly described by prospect theory (PT). Thus, PT has been integrated into fuzzy decision making (FDM). Since then, FDM with PT have been rapidly developed. In this paper, we systematically analyze the existing FDM with prospect framework. Firstly, a detailed analysis about the existing research on this topic is given separately, including how to determine the reference point, how to express the value function and weighting function in PT under vague conditions. With this in mind, the applications and challenges of the existing methods are described and some possible directions for future research are provided. According to our review, it is worth mentioning that the FDM with psychological factors of decision makers will surely receive much more attention from researchers and practitioners in the future. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Decision making; Prospect theory; Types of fuzzy sets","Behavioral research; Decision theory; Fuzzy sets; Bounded rationality; Decisions makings; Fuzzy Decision making; Literature reviews; Prospect theory; Reference points; State of the art; Type of fuzzy set; Value functions; Weighting functions; Decision making","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72071135); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, SWUFE","The work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 72071135) and by the Guanghua Talent Project of Southwestern University of Finance and Economics.","Schoemaker P.J.H., The expected utility model - Its variants, purposes, evidence and limitations, J.

Recently, gradient structures have been of research interest as it facilitates intrinsic synergetic strengthening. In the current work, gradient microstructures are obtained on laser-powder bed fusion processed (LPBF) CoCrFeMnNi high entropy alloy using ultrasonic nanocrystal surface modification (UNSM). The UNSM treatment resulted in a thin layer of gradient microstructures with a gradient in dislocation density, twin fraction, and grain size on the surface of the LPBF samples. The gradient microstructures led to gradient properties and contributed significantly to hetero deformation-induced (HDI) strengthening. Further, a comparison with the wrought counterparts, which showed higher HDI stresses and strain hardening than the LPBF samples, establishes the need for a substantial strength difference between the hard UNSM-affected region and the soft unaffected region for significant HDI strengthening. Moreover, in the current work, a dislocation-based constitutive model is developed to represent the deformation mechanism of the gradient structured sample and is validated with the experimental results. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Dislocation-based constitutive model; Gradient structures; High entropy alloys; Laser-powder bed fusion; Ultrasonic nanocrystal surface modification","Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Deformation; Entropy; High-entropy alloys; Iron alloys; Manganese alloys; Microstructure; Nanocrystalline alloys; Nanocrystals; Powder metals; Strain hardening; Strengthening (metal); Dislocation-based constitutive model; Gradient microstructure; Gradient structure; High entropy alloys; Laser powders; Laser-powder bed fusion; Nanocrystal surface; Powder bed; Surface-modification; Ultrasonic nanocrystal surface modification; Constitutive models","","","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2016M3D1A1023384, 2019H1D3A1A01102866, 2021R1A2C3006662, 2022R1A5A1030054); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work was supported by the Creative Materials Discovery Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea ( NRF ), funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT ( 2016M3D1A1023384 ).

Although photoabsorbing additives like Sudan I can attenuate light to decrease excessive light penetration, they also require longer exposure time to solidify the resin. In this work, photocatalytic zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONP) were used as resin additives substituting photoabsorbers to control overexposure that causes loss in dimensional accuracy. Compared to adding 0.1 wt/wt% of Sudan I, adding 2.5 wt/wt% of ZnONP not only showed similar level of control in light penetration, but reduced the required curing time of the resin. Significant improvement in preventing unwanted curing was also observed in resin with ZnONP, as evident by our printing tests on open channels and overhanging structures. Unlike Sudan I which deteriorated the mechanical properties of printed parts, ZnONP additives have rendered more effective curing that resulted in improved tensile strength, fracture strain and Young's modulus. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Digital light processing (DLP); Dimensional accuracy; Vat photopolymerization; Zinc oxide nanoparticles","Additives; Curing; Elastic moduli; II-VI semiconductors; Photopolymerization; Resins; Strain; Tensile strength; ZnO nanoparticles; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Digital light processing; Dimensional accuracy; Light penetration; Photo polymerization; Sudan I; Vat photopolymerization; Zinc oxide nanoparticles; 3D printers","","","","","Singapore Centre for 3D Printing; National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF; Nanyang Technological University, NTU","This research is supported by the National Research Foundation , Prime Minister’s Office, Singapore under its Medium-Sized Centre funding scheme.

However, the weak surface properties of these steels significantly limited the production and application scope. Various surface modification solutions were proposed, but they were not suitable for mass production or degraded the physical properties of base materials. Here, a new solution is proposed for mass-producing an ultra-thin multilayer clad steel sheet using an additive manufacturing process without changing the superior mechanical property of the high-Mn steel. Functionally graded multilayers from high-Mn steel to high-strength low-alloy steel have been deposited onto a high-Mn steel slab by a powder-fed type additive manufacturing process to improve its surface properties. During the deposition at high laser intensities, solidification cracks appeared in the first and second layers. The hot crack susceptibility of the functionally graded multilayers was elucidated by employing thermodynamic solidification calculation and thermo-mechanical analysis. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; Crack susceptibility; Functionally graded materials; Manganese steel; Surface modification","3D printers; Additives; Alloy steel; Cracks; Density (specific gravity); Functionally graded materials; High strength alloys; High strength steel; Manganese alloys; Manganese steel; Slags; Solidification; Surface properties; Additive manufacturing process; Clad layer; Crack susceptibilities; Functionally graded; Graded multilayers; High Mn steels; Hot crack susceptibility; Manganese steel; Microstructural characterizations; Surface-modification; Multilayers","","","","","POSCO; Steel Science Program, (20188190); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (NRF-2022R1A5A1030054); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIP) ( NRF-2022R1A5A1030054 ).

The particular objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of multi-layer simulations of the laser PBF process and to discuss the potential and challenges of this approach. The approach includes using the discrete element method (DEM) to simulate particle spreading on a powder bed, as well as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and heat transfer to simulate laser-powder/matter interactions, in a sequential manner to about 10 layers only with a small scan area, limited by currently available computational power. The simulation results can offer insight such as melt pool shapes and sizes, also solidified surface morphology along different build layers. The model also includes a surface tracking algorithm to account for the formation of voids and lack-of-fusion pores. In addition to achieving the main objective of this study, i.e., feasibility demonstration of this computational process, it is also noted that, for the case studied, the defects in a former layer may shrink, or even vanish, due to the extra thermal energy received from laser scanning of subsequent layers. This study has successfully demonstrated the sequential linkage between a discrete element method and a thermo-fluid model in a multi-layer deposition fashion and the experimental validation will be performed in future work. With significantly greater computational capabilities in the future, the developed method may potentially be utilized as a means to understand physical phenomena and select key process parameters for PBF fabrications of small features. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Computational fluid dynamics;

Therefore, a double-column tall pier with SLs was designed and compared with a conventional double-column tall pier with reinforced concrete beams (RCBs). The seismic fragility of the double-column tall piers with SLs and RCBs was evaluated using incremental dynamic analyses when subjected to far-field and near-fault ground motions. The economic losses in the life cycle between the double-column tall piers with SLs and RCBs were compared using the proposed loss assessment methodology. The results revealed that the SLs between the columns could provide additional energy dissipation to reduce the seismic damage and vulnerability of the double-column tall pier. Therefore, the double-column tall pier with SLs exhibited lower damage probability for the various damage states and fewer economic losses than the traditional double-column tall pier due to the SLs dissipating enough energy. The proposed double-column tall pier with SLs manifested more reliable seismic resilience than the conventional double-column pier with RCBs. The double-column tall pier with SLs showed a better economy in the long-term time interval. Moreover, the life cycle losses of the double-column tall pier with SLs and RCBs under the far-field ground motions are lower than those of the double-column tall pier with SLs and RCBs under the near-field ground motions. © 2022 Institution of Structural Engineers","Double-column tall pier; Loss assessment; Near-fault ground motions; Seismic fragility; Seismic resilience; Shear links","","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo, (202003 N4138); Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51608282, 52278189); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LY20E080010); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF","The research work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [52278189, 51608282], the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LY20E080010], and the Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo City [202003 N4138].","Shrestha B., Hao H., Parametric study of seismic performance of super-elastic shape memory alloy-reinforced bridge piers, Struct.

The use of the perovskites in such technologies is hindered by their instability at ambient conditions. In this report we describe a new method for fabrication of the polypropylene/metal halide perovskites composite in one single step by co-extrusion of the perovskite precursors with polypropylene. Perovskite quantum dots are formed in-situ, and are uniformly distributed in the polymer matrix. The as-fabricated material demonstrates high quantum yield and unprecedented stability at ambient conditions. We further demonstrate that an extruded strand can be used directly as a filament for 3D printing technology. The developed method is simple, has literally no waste, and unlimitedly scalable. It efficiently solves the problem of stability of perovskites, simultaneously involving them into additive manufacturing technologies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Extrusion; Perovskites; Polypropylene composites","Additives; Costs; Extrusion; Functional materials; Perovskite; Polypropylenes; Semiconductor quantum dots; Throughput; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Additive manufacturing technology; Ambient conditions; Green production; High-throughput; Highly stables; Low-costs; Polypropylene composite; Production methods; 3D printers","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (21–73-20024); Russian Science Foundation, RSF; Kazan Federal University","Funding text 1: This study was performed with the funds, allocated by Kazan Federal University to develop the project ""Materials for green energy and sustainability"".

The improved three-phase random aggregates algorithm model, a new damage simulation method, and the expanded polystyrene (EPS) particles fixed-point monitoring technique were applied. It was found that EPS content, confining pressure, and the mechanical properties of the interface transition zone all affect the damage evolution process of SLS. Moreover, the propagation speeds of cracks also varied among different parts of the SLS. Four damage forms were defined based on the propagation speed of cracks. © 2022, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","","Dynamics; Silt; Condition; Damage mechanism; Deformation Characteristics; Dynamics analysis; Expanded polystyrene; Lightweight soils; Meso scale; Propagation speed; Three phasis; Yellow River-China; confining pressure; crack propagation; damage mechanics; deformation; dynamic analysis; silty soil; soil mechanics; transition zone; triaxial test; Cracks","","","","","","","Zhu W., Ji F.L., Ma D.G., Li M.D., Shear strength properties of lightweight bead-treated soil made from dredged silt, Chin.

In order to improve its mechanical properties, solid phase sintered, liquid phase sintered and solid-liquid phase sintered alumina (Al2O3) ceramics were prepared by Vat photopolymerization 3D printing technology, respectively. In the experiment, Al2O3 was used as the main material to study the effects of TiO2 solid phase additive, MgO-SiO2 liquid phase additives and TiO2-MgO-SiO2 solid-liquid phase additives on Al2O3 ceramics sintering behavior and mechanical properties, so as to improve the sintering density and mechanical properties of alumina ceramics. The best composition ratio and sintering temperature were determined by shrinkage, relative density, Raman, XRD and SEM characterization. Under optimal sintering conditions, The comprehensive properties of Al2O3 ceramics prepared by liquid phase sintering are more balanced. And has excellent mechanical properties. The flexural strength reached 317 ± 34 MPa and the Vickers hardness up to 1250 ± 102 HV30. Thus, nine types of truss structures are prepared to study their mechanical properties. By changing the structure types, the order of compressive strength is FCC > BCC > DLS. By changing the number of units, the order of compressive strength is 3 × 3 × 3 units >2 × 2 × 2 units >1 × 1 × 1 units. The Al2O3 ceramics prepared by the liquid phase sintering exhibit excellent mechanical compression properties and energy absorption capacity. The FCC structure of 3 × 3 × 3 units can reach 23.2 ± 1.7 MPa compressive strength. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","3D printing; Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ceramics; Mechanical property;

To reduce the probability of cracking, this work proposes an innovative strategy to optimize the geometry of the substrate by reducing its mechanical stiffness and, consequently, the stress accumulation during LPBF. To assess the feasibility of the strategy, a coupled thermo-mechanical finite element model, calibrated with the experimental evidence obtained from the LPBF metal deposition of a bridge-type structure, is used to predict the thermo-mechanical behavior of two T-shape AM parts built on (i) a typical solid substrate and (ii) a groove patterned substrate, respectively. The results show that several visible cracks appear at the interface between the build and the typical solid substrate due to stress concentration (up to 1600 MPa), while a crack-free component can be manufactured by adding grooves through the thickness of the substrate, without compromising the resulting microstructure and microhardness of the metallic materials with high crack sensitivity. The difference between the groove patterned substrate design with respect to the use of support structures used for printing cantilever structures is clarified to further justify the novelty of the proposed approach. © 2022 The Authors","Cracking; Laser powder bed fusion; Structural optimization; Thermomechanical simulation","Cracks; Powder metals; Structural design; Substrates; Crack free; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Patterned substrates; Powder bed; Solid substrates; Stress-induced; Structural optimisations; Substrate design; Thermomechanical simulation; Structural optimization","","","","","AR-Lab; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (872570); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Enterprise Ireland, (CF-2020–1564-A/B); Enterprise Ireland; China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201906290011); China Scholarship Council, CSC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFB1100100); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","Funding text 1: This work was funded by the Enterprise Ireland project (No. CF-2020–1564-A/B), the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2016YFB1100100), the European KYKLOS 4.0 project (No. 872570) and the China Scholarship Council (No. 201906290011).

In an electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF) process, the same sintering mechanisms occur but only with the aim to form small connections between the particles (necks). A proper neck formation is central for the EB-PBF process because, among other effects, ensures the thermal stability of the process and helps to avoid smoke phenomena. This work presents a numerical study of neck formation under the EB-PBF processing conditions. A new type of modelling is introduced for the temperature sintering load and included in a phase-field model, which simulates the neck growth during the EB-PBF process of Ti6Al4V powders. The model was validated with an ad-hoc experiment, which provided a deviation with respect to the estimated neck diameter of about 9%. The deviation was investigated by reasonably varying the processing conditions. The results showed that the thermal history, the process time scale (including also the cooling phase), and the geometrical characteristics of the particles significantly affected the sintering rate and neck radius. © 2022, The Author(s).","Electron beam melting; Neck; Oxide; Phase-field; Ti6Al4V","Aluminum alloys; Electron beams; Powders; Sintering; Ternary alloys; Thermodynamic stability; Titanium alloys; Electron-beam; Electron-beam melting; Field studies; Fusion process; Neck; Neck formation; Neck growth; Phase fields; Powder bed; Processing condition; Smoke","","","","","Politecnico di Torino, POLITO","Open access funding provided by Politecnico di Torino within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.

In this regard, the recently developed numerical simulation software of L-PBF technologies can represent an effective tool, since many of them provide solidification data (i.e. temperature gradient and cooling rate) useful for microstructure prediction. In this work, a numerical model was applied to simulate the processing of four single scan tracks of 316L stainless steel processed with different parameters. Temperature and cooling rate around the melt pool were extracted from the numerical model and used to estimate the microstructure cellular arm spacing and the microhardness. Experimental measurements were then compared with the estimated values revealing good agreement. The good agreement between experimental and estimated values shows the advantages of the proposed method for microstructure and microhardness prediction based on numerical modelling as a useful resource for process optimization according to the required final microstructural features.

Moreover, to quantify strain localization ability for metals, a material index for strain localization susceptibility (SLS) was proposed. However, the effectiveness and availability of that index were not examined in detail. In this study, a Cu-based single crystal was examined using the crystal-plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) model. This model incorporates the strain localization mechanism from the non-crystallographic shear band. Additionally, a new material index for SLS was introduced. The results showed that the new material index could reflect the SLS of the material. Meanwhile, a critical material index value based on strain localization was determined for predicting the crack behavior. This study also discusses the plastic deformation behavior near the crack tip with different material indices for SLS. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","crack; crystal plasticity; material index; non-crystallographic shear band; strain localization susceptibility","Crack tips; Finite element method; Plasticity; Shear bands; Cracked bodies; Crystal plasticity; Crystal plasticity finite element method; Crystallographic shears; Material behaviour; Material index; Mechanical behavior; Non-crystallographic shear band; Strain localization susceptibility; Strain localizations; Single crystals","","","","","Kyushu University; China Scholarship Council, CSC, (202008050165); Research Institute for Information Technology, Kyushu University, RIIT","Funding text 1: The computation was conducted using the computer resources offered under the category of General Projects by the Research Institute for Information Technology, Kyushu University.

Despite its promise, the industrial use of BJ3DP is today hindered by two shortcomings: (i) Printed parts have low strength in the as-cured state, and (ii) the mechanical properties of the sintered parts are poor when sintered using standard sintering practice. This study was carried out to address those shortcomings. We introduce a new WHA powder for BJ3DP and compare it to existing powders [1]. Physical properties (flow, apparent density, size distribution) and the green strength after BJ3DP are reported. Sintering and microstructural evolution differences between the new WHA powder, existing WHA powders for BJ3DP and conventional press-and-sinter WHA powders were investigated. Good densification during the early stages of sintering enabled the sintering of the new powder to full density. After sintering, mechanical properties of the printed specimens were evaluated and compared to the properties of cold isostatically pressed WHA specimens using conventional powder blends with similar chemistry. The new powder has superior green strength in the as-printed condition and is therefore a better candidate for the manufacturing of complex parts. It also sinters much faster than currently available powders and achieves mechanical properties that match those of conventionally processed WHA. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Binder jetting 3D printing (BJ3DP); New WHA powder (NP); Plasma densified WHA powder (PD); Tungsten heavy alloy (WHA)","3D printers; Sintering; Tungsten alloys; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Binder jetting 3d printing; Green strength; Manufacturing process; New WHA powder; Plasma densified WHA powder; Tungsten heavy alloy (WHA); Tungsten heavy alloy (WHAs); Tungsten heavy alloys; Powders","","","","","","","Stawovy, Et al., Tungsten Heavy Metal Alloy Powders and Methods of Forming Them, US Patent # 10,807,168 B2, Oct.20, (2020); Bai Y., Et al., Effect of particle size distribution on powder packing and sintering in binder jetting additive manufacturing of metals, ASME J.

A PEMFC regularly consists of a stack of individual cells in which each consists of polar plates and a membrane electrode assembly. To achieve the best possible electric conductivity over the series connection of cells, the contact pressure in between the cells must be uniformly distributed over the cell area. This pressure is usually applied to the stack by end plates, which frame the stack and are clamped together by bolts, which are tightened by a defined torque. Typically, these end plates are made from bulk material with no or limited optimization. Looking at mobility applications, e.g., in aerospace, a fuel cell should ideally provide high efficiency at the lowest weight. Based on this assumption, this paper uses topology optimization varying the material as well as the design space to derive new design concepts for the end plates of a PEMFC. The designs are compared with respect to an even stress distribution to the fuel cell stack, the weight of the plates, and the manufacturability in the laser powder bed fusion process. The most promising design is manufactured and results in a weight decrease of 48% compared to previously used aluminum bulk plates. Finally, the optimized base plates are applied to a test cell and the performance is compared to their conventional counterparts, showing a 1% increase in electric stack power despite the lower mass.  © 2022 Author(s).","","3D printers; Contact pressures; Endplates; High-power-density; Individual cells; Low operating temperature; Low-costs; Membrane electrode assemblies; Optimization and design; Proton-exchange membranes fuel cells; Series connections; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)","","","","","","","Rosen M.A., Koohi-Fayegh S., The prospects for hydrogen as an energy carrier: An overview of hydrogen energy and hydrogen energy systems, Energy Ecol.

Monel K-500 is a Ni-based alloy widely used for marine and offshore applications because of its excellent corrosion resistance and good combination of strength and ductility. In this study, laser-assisted DED (L-DED) was used to print Monel K-500 parts from powder. The key process parameters, including the laser power and scanning speed, were optimized to obtain single beads with desirable geometry and blocks with nearly full density (≥99%). The block samples printed by L-DED exhibit ∼20% higher ultimate tensile strength and ∼60% higher elongation to failure than their conventional cast counterparts. From the microstructure examination, it is found that the parts printed with a low laser power have fine grains and an alternating equiaxed/columnar-grain sandwich structure with high tensile strength. In contrast, those printed with a high laser power have coarse columnar grains with a strong <001> texture but low tensile strength. The mechanism accounting for the grain structure evolution was studied by computational fluid dynamics and cellular automata simulations. The anisotropy in mechanical properties is mainly attributed to the difference in grain boundary strengthening effects. Moreover, the increase in hardness and tensile strength of the heat-treated samples is attributed to the precipitation hardening effect. This work exemplifies how the process parameters can be tuned to control the grain texture to achieve superior mechanical properties for parts of Monel K-500 and other metals printed by L-DED. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Directed energy deposition; Heat treatment; Mechanical properties; Microstructure evolution; Monel K-500; Numerical simulation","Computational fluid dynamics; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant alloys; Deposition; Fabrication; Grain boundaries; Marine applications; Nickel alloys; Offshore oil well production; Seawater corrosion; Textures; Columnar grain; Directed energy; Directed energy deposition; Energy depositions; Laser power; Laser-assisted; Microstructure evolutions; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Monel K-500; Process parameters; Tensile strength","","","","","DNV Singapore Pte Ltd; National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF; Economic Development Board - Singapore, EDB","This work was supported by the Economic Development Board, Singapore and DNV Singapore Pte Ltd through the Industrial Postgraduate Programme with Nanyang Technological University, Singapore and by the National Research Foundation, Singapore under its Medium-Sized Centre funding scheme through the Marine and Offshore Program.","Bergsma J.M., 3D-Printing and the maritime construction sector, Hiper, pp. 428-457, (2016); Ziolkowski M., Dyl T., Possible applications of additive manufacturing technologies in shipbuilding: a review, Machines, 8, pp. 1-34, (2020); Vujovic I., Kuzmanic I., Kulenovic Z., Males N., Navy C., Additive manufacturing of spare parts in maritime industry-technology transfer in mariner education, 21st, Trends Dev.

This article proposes a novel dual-linearly polarized digital predistortion (DLP-DPD) scheme for DLP millimeter-wave (mmWave) phased array UE. Different from conventional single-polarized arrays, the DPD here not only aims to deal with the nonlinear distortion caused by power amplifiers (PAs) but also the cross-polarization interference which is a specific distortion in DLP phased array system. Theoretical analysis and system modeling of DLP phased array is presented, and a DLP-DPD model is proposed according to the derivation. Furthermore, in order to reduce the complexity of the DPD module, the proposed DLP-DPD scheme only needs to update a small part of coefficients when the user moves within a beam coverage. To validate the proposed DLP-DPD scheme, experiments were carried out on a 1 × 4 DLP mmWave phased array at 26.5 GHz. The experimental results show that DLP-DPD scheme can achieve good performance in DLP phased array dynamic scenario, dealing with the nonlinearity and cross-polarization interference well.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Cross-polarization interference; digital predistortion (DPD); millimeter-wave (mmWave); nonlinearity; phased array steering; power amplifier (PA)","Crosstalk; Light amplifiers; Millimeter waves; Mobile telecommunication systems; Multiplexing equipment; Polarization; Array; Complexity theory; Cross-polarization interference; Digital predistortion; Millimeter-wave; Millimeter-wave technology; Millimeterwave communications; Mobile handsets; Nonlinearity; Phased array steering; Phased-arrays; Power amplifier; Power amplifiers","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62022025); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (62101116, BK20200065)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant 62022025, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province under Grant BK20200065, and in part by the NSFC under Grant 62101116.","Hong W., Et al., The role of millimeter-wave technologies in 5G/6G wireless communications, Ieee J.

However, the existence of a penetration–saturation trade-off (PSTO) in conventional BJ 3D printing hinders its development. Since an increase in saturation is often accompanied by an increase in penetration distance of binder (P), it is difficult to produce high strength and high precision green parts; this limitation is not conducive to the development of new material systems. To overcome this limitation, a methacrylate-based, thermally activated free radical polymerization system was used in this study as a binder to produce green parts under in situ curing conditions, created by increasing the temperature of the powder bed. The penetration of the powder bed by the binder is controlled by regulating its curing status during printing. The proposed rapid in situ curing printing process overcomes the PSTO associated with conventional BJ and can inform the optimization of binder formulation, equipment design, and binder jet printing. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Binder jetting; Green part; Penetration distance; Saturation","Curing; Economic and social effects; Free radical polymerization; Free radicals; Powder metals; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Binder jetting; Ceramic composites; Green part; Penetration distance; Powder bed; Saturation; Situ curing; Trade off; 3D printers","","","","","","","Han Y., Wei Q., Chang P., Hu K., Okoro O.V., Shavandi A., Nie L., Three-dimensional printing of hydroxyapatite composites for biomedical application, Crystals, 11, 4, (2021); Lifton V.A., Lifton G., Simon S., Options for additive rapid prototyping methods (3D printing) in MEMS technology, Rapid Prototyp.

Direct-energy deposition additive manufacturing techniques have gained much attention from the industry to build/repair in-service components. However, this process undergoes complex dynamics of melting and solidification raising challenges to the effective control of grain structure causing potential structural failure. This research study was conducted to investigate the potential of using high-intensity ultrasonic to control the solidification process and scaling up the system to manufacture large components. From the feasibility study, it was noted that ultrasonic can assist in the refinement of the grain structure and also reduce anomalies such as porosities. Under the feasibility study, a range of frequencies and power configurations were considered to ease the scale-up of the system. Based on the studied ultrasonic configurations, the 40 kHz 60 W configuration was finalized to use in the scale-up. It was also noted the reduction of hot cracks in the ultrasonic-assisted additive manufacturing due to the constitutional supercooling during solidification by lowering the temperature gradient in the bulk of the melt pool. Furthermore, it was also noted that the grain orientation is perpendicular to the direction of vibration which potentially can be used to control the orientation of the grains as required. This new finding provides new applications to exploit the ultrasonic-assisted additive manufacturing process. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Advanced manufacturing; Direct energy deposition; Ultrasonic vibration; Ultrasonic-assisted manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Deposition; Failure (mechanical); Fracture mechanics; Planning; Process control; Solidification; Ultrasonic effects; Ultrasonic waves; Additive manufacturing process; Advanced manufacturing; Direct energy deposition; Energy depositions; Feasibility studies; Scale-up; Scaling-up; Ultrasonic-assisted manufacturing; Ultrasonic-vibration; Vibration assisted; Grain size and shape","","","","","Brunel Innovation Centre; Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, UK Government, BEIS","The authors gratefully acknowledge the Nuclear Innovation Programme of Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) for funding that made this study possible.

Results showed that the solution temperature and aging temperature were the most influential factors relative to the mechanical properties. The optimum heat treatment was then obtained as 920 °C/2 h/water quenching + 550 °C/3 h/air cooling and the corresponding tensile strength was 1045.2 MPa and the elongation was 13.6%. Compared to a solution temperature of 850 °C, more fine secondary α phase (αS) and higher geometrically necessary dislocations (GND) density were obtained when solution temperature was 920 °C, which promoted the increased strength by increasing the interface strengthening effect of αS/β and the dislocation strengthening. However, the microstructure of the continuously coarsening αGB resulted in decreased elongation when the solution was at 920 °C. As the aging temperature increased from 550 to 650 °C, the GND density was reduced and the microstructures of primary α (αP), αS with various crystallographic orientations, lamellar α, and equiaxial αP were coarsened. Therefore, the elongation of the specimen aging at a higher aging temperature increased while the strength decreased.

In a quest for clarification on the effect of the hot isostatic pressing (HIP) on the fatigue outcomes, both untreated and HIPed specimens were studied. The former material indicated relatively modest fatigue resistance mainly due to the presence of inherent processing defects, whereas the latter one revealed a promising fatigue strength in comparison with unreinforced Ti-6Al-4V and exhibited transgranular fatigue crack nucleation provoked by the crystallographic slip in long-length layers of α grain. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; High cycle fatigue; Hot isostatic pressing; Metal Matrix Composites; Titanium alloy","3D printers; Aluminum alloys; High-cycle fatigue; Hot isostatic pressing; Metallic matrix composites; Powder metals; Reinforcement; Sintering; Ternary alloys; Textures; Yttrium oxide; Zirconia; Fatigue performance; Four-point-bending; High cycle fatigue; Hot-isostatic pressings; Laser powders; Matrix composite; Metal matrix; Metal matrix composite; Powder bed; Titanium (alloys); Titanium alloys","","","","","Université Sorbonne Paris Nord; Hispanics in Philanthropy, HIP; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, CNRS","The support by the Université Sorbonne Paris Nord (USPN) “CARAMEL” platform facility funded by Région Île-de-France and the CNRS for the HIP post-treatments is very welcomed.

The gradient porosity of NL-TPMS was controlled by a sinusoidal function and the influence of the number of cycles on the compression failure mechanism has been investigated. Homogenous TPMS and NL-TPMS were manufactured by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) with 316L stainless steel powder. Digital image correlation (DIC) and finite element analysis (FEA) were applied to explore the compression behavior of NL-TPMS. The strain of the plateau end of homogenous TPMS decreases as the porosity increases, and the DIC results show that homogenous TPMS deformed with a 45° diagonal shear band. The compression results show that anisotropy of mechanical properties exists in NL-TPMS. The length of the first plateau and compressive proof strength increase as the number of cycles of porosity increases. The cycle of gradient porosity also influences the compression behavior of NL-TPMS, and a periodic failure deformation was observed in the NL-TPMS rather than a layer-by-layer compression deformation in normal gradient porous structures. The maximum principal strain of NL-TPMS detected by DIC presents a periodic distribution, which corresponds to the sinusoidal period designed function of NL-TPMS. © 2022 The Authors","Digital image correlation; Laser powder bed fusion; Mechanical property; Nonlinear gradient; Porous structure","Deformation; Failure (mechanical); Porosity; Strain measurement; Compression behaviours; Cycle number; Design method; Digital image correlations; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Nonlinear gradient; Number of cycles; Porous structures; Powder bed; Image correlation","","","","","Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation-Youth Fund Project; Guangdong Provincial Foundation Committee for Basic and Applied Basic Research; Zhanjiang Ocean Youth Talent Innovation Project, (2021E05001); Zhanjiang Science and Technology Bureau; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2021A1515110033)","Funding text 1: This research was funded by Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation -Youth Fund Project (No. 2021A1515110033 ), and Zhanjiang Ocean Youth Talent Innovation Project (No. 2021E05001).; Funding text 2: The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Mingkang Zhang reports financial support was provided by Guangdong Provincial Foundation Committee for Basic and Applied Basic Research.

The additively manufactured (AM) alloy was subjected to high-pressure torsion processing at room temperature successfully at different number of turns in HPT and then inspected through hot tensile testing at 298 and 573 K using strain rates ranging from 10–1 to 10–4 s−1. The processed alloy showed extensive refinement and high dislocation density that was associated with considerable strength at ambient temperature. The as-deposited and processed samples of the alloy exhibited significantly higher tensile strength and elongation under hot deformation conditions compared with their cast counterpart alloys. The room temperature-HPT processing presented ultrafine α-Al and well-distributed nanosized eutectic Si particles which significantly improved the tensile behaviour and thermal stability of the processed microstructures. The formation of fibrous structures has enhanced the flow behaviour and cavitation resistance at the elevated testing temperature. The current work indicates the impact of room temperature-HPT processing on the mechanical performance of the controllable AM-deposited alloy to meet industrial needs without further heat treatments or alloying additions. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Copper alloys; Deformation; Heat treatment; Room temperature; Strain rate; Tensile strength; Thermodynamic stability; Torsion testing; Torsional stress; Cu alloy; Fusion process; High pressure torsions; Hot deformation behaviors; Hot tensile testing; Laser powders; Powder bed; Si-Cu alloys; Strain-rates; Ultra-fine grained ( UFG); Tensile testing","","","","","Additive Technologies, (2018-2022); MSM/EF; Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research and University of Technology; University of Southampton; Ministerstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy, MŠMT; Ministerstvo Průmyslu a Obchodu, MPO; School of Engineering, Monash University Malaysia, (EF17_048/0007350); School of Engineering, Monash University Malaysia","This work has received support from the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research and University of Technology (Iraq), the University of Southampton, School of Engineering (UK).

In this work, distinctive dual-stage heat treatments were proposed for improving the microstructure and properties of the laser powder bed fusion processed Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The effects of the heat treatments on phase transformation behaviors, microstructural characteristics, mechanical and tribological properties of the alloy were investigated systematically. The dual-stage heat treatments combined with salt bath quenching proved to be an effective approach for obtaining fine lamellar α/β microstructures through the introduction of martensitic and massive phase transformations, as well as achieving optimized strength and ductility. The grain boundary populations of the alloy were strongly influenced by the phase transformation behaviors. Moreover, high-density dislocations were introduced during the dual-stage heat treatments, and the <a> type dislocations were dominant. The nonadditive strengthening mixture rule between obstacles and dislocations was substantiated in this alloy. Different wear mechanisms were found in the dual-stage heat-treated alloys depending on their microstructural characteristics. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of phase transformation, strengthening and toughening are also discussed. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Heat treatment; Microstructure; Phase transformation; Titanium alloy","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Grain boundaries; Heat treatment; Martensitic transformations; Mechanisms; Microstructure; Ternary alloys; Vanadium alloys; Dual stage; Mechanical performance; Microstructural characteristics; Microstructure and properties; Phase transformation behavior; Phase transformation mechanisms; Phases transformation; Post heat-treatment; Post-heat treatment; Titanium (alloys); Titanium alloys","","","","","Graduate Training and Innovation Practice Base of Hunan Province; Postgraduate Scientific Research Innovation Project of Hunan Province, (CX20220416); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52074114, 52174361); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; China Scholarship Council, CSC, (202106130051); China Scholarship Council, CSC; State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing, SKLSP, (SKLSP202212); State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing, SKLSP","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 52174361 , 52074114 ), the fund of the State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing in NWPU ( SKLSP202212 ), Postgraduate Scientific Research Innovation Project of Hunan Province (CX20220416) and Graduate Training and Innovation Practice Base of Hunan Province.

Current design methods for elastically isotropic lattice structures are mostly based on the assumption of isotropic constitutive materials. However, additive manufacturing (AM) fabricated materials generally exhibit undesired anisotropy due to the layer-by-layer construction, which requires precise material models to be incorporated in structural design framework. This work presents a design method of variable thickness triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) shell lattices to achieve elastic isotropy from homogeneous anisotropic constitutive materials. A gradient-based optimization method which adopts the universal anisotropy index as the objective is developed to handle any orthotropic lattices, extending the widely used method based on the Zener anisotropy ratio that only suits cubic lattices. To validate the proposed design method, the transversely isotropic elasticity model of micro laser powder bed fusion (μLPBF) fabricated stainless steel 316 L (SS316L) is calibrated through tensile tests, and then incorporated into the optimization method to design elastically isotropic variable thickness N14, IWP, and P shell lattices. Compression tests results of μLPBF fabricated N14 lattices demonstrate that the proposed design reduces the relative standard deviation of the lattice's Young's moduli along nine directions from 0.77 (uniform thickness) to 0.75. Further numerical analysis reveals that the Young's moduli of N14, IWP and P shell lattices along [001] direction are reduced by 2%−6% depending on the lattice type, while those along [100] and [101] directions remain almost constant after anisotropic SS316L (Ez/Ex = 0.92) replaces the isotropic one. This work provides a design and analysis method for AM fabricated TPMS shell lattices made of anisotropic constitutive materials, and reveals the influences of anisotropic constitutive materials on the elastic properties of lattices. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive Manufacturing; Anisotropic constitutive material; Laser powder bed fusion; Shell lattices","Additives; Anisotropy; Compression testing; Elastic moduli; Fabrication; Shells (structures); Structural design; Tensile testing; Anisotropic constitutive material; Constitutive materials; Design method; Isotropic lattices; Isotropics; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Lattice structures; Powder bed; Shell lattice; 3D printers","","","","","Innovation and Technology Fund, ITF, (ITS/008/19)","This work is supported by the Innovation and Technology Fund of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Project No. ITS/008/19 ).

However, its limitations including a high threshold for high-precision preparation and poor surface roughness in metalworking impede further development, such as metallic pentamode metamaterials (PMs) due to the special structural regimes and extremely strict size requirement at the intersection nodes. Herein, a novel electropolishing-enhanced 3D printing method is proposed to fabricate high-precision metallic PMs with improved precision and surface smoothness. Experimental results evince that this hybrid additive-subtractive method can fabricate PMs with much smaller critical size and smoother surface, which cannot be achieved by the same-level 3D printing methods. The minimum processable size can reach ∼ 100 μm that greatly breaks through the limitation of initial additive manufacturing (EOS M280 SLM, ∼ 200 ± 50 μm). A ∼ 100 μm intersection can support 107 times its own weight. Moreover, the D/d of elementary biconical rods can be refined from an initial 6 to an astounding 52, which is beyond the scope of conventional 3D printing. This proposed hybrid additive-subtractive method, namely electropolishing-enhanced 3D printing, breaks the limits of conventional 3D printing by significantly improving the precision and shows great potential in low-cost but high-precision manufacturing. © 2022 The Author(s)","Electropolishing; Extreme fabrication; Hybrid additive-subtractive method; Pentamode metamaterials; Ti-6Al-4V 3D printing","3D printers; Aluminum alloys; Fabrication; Metals; Metamaterials; Surface roughness; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Extreme fabrication; High-precision; Hybrid additive-subtractive method; Metallics; Pentamode metamaterial; Printing method; Subtractive method; Ti-6al-4v 3d printing; Additives","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51925503, 52105575, 52188102); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2020M672331, 2022T150234)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51925503 , 52105575 and 52188102 ), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant Nos. 2020M672331 and 2022T150234 ).

Uniaxial fully-reversed strain-controlled fatigue tests were conducted on polished smooth specimens in the low-cycle and high-cycle fatigue regimes for three material states: no heat treatment, stress relief heat treatment and T6 heat treatment. The effect of the heat treatment on microstructure, ductility, hardness and tensile properties was also investigated. It was found that the microstructural transformation associated with the heat treatments increased the ductility, and reduced the hardness, the tensile strength, and the fatigue resistance, particularly in the low-cycle fatigue regime. Thus, these standard heat treatments used in conventional heat-treatable aluminium alloys are not recommended for LPBD aluminium alloys subjected to cyclic strain loading. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","AlSi10Mg aluminium alloy; Cyclic deformation; Heat treatment; Laser powder bed fusion; Low-cycle fatigue","Deformation; Ductility; Fatigue testing; Hardness; Heat resistance; Heat treatment; High-cycle fatigue; Stress relief; Tensile strength; Alsi10mg aluminum alloy; Cyclic deformation behaviours; Cyclic deformations; Effect of heat treatments; Fully reversed; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Low cycle fatigues; Post-processing; Powder bed; Low-cycle fatigue","","","","","Regional Operational Program of the Center, (CENTRO-01-0145-FEDER-028789, POCI-01-0247-FEDER-042536); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (LA/P/0112/2020, UIDB/00285/2020); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT; Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior, MCTES; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (PT2020); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","The authors would like to acknowledge the sponsoring under the project no. 028789, financed by the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER), through the Portugal-2020 program (PT2020), under the Regional Operational Program of the Center (CENTRO-01-0145-FEDER-028789), and the project POCI-01-0247-FEDER-042536, financed by European Funds, through program COMPETE2020, under the Eureka smart label S0129-AddDies.

The application of blended powders in L-PBF enables to tailor the microstructures and obtain a mixture of α’ + β phases. In this work, we demonstrate an effective method to engineer the phase fraction of an L-PBF manufactured Ti alloy using blended powders consisting of Ti-6Al-4V and 3 wt% Fe particles. By varying laser parameters, the as-built microstructures transit from α’ dominated microstructure to a nearly complete β-dominant microstructure. High-speed operando X-ray diffraction during L-PBF processing combined with X-ray fluorescence and EBSD characterization allows for relating microstructure to the spatial distribution of the β-stabilizer Fe under the high cooling rates typical for L-PBF. The as-built microstructure containing large amounts of β phase achieves high strength and enhanced ductility without post-processing heat treatments. © 2022 The Authors","In situ alloying; Laser powder bed fusion; Mechanical properties; Operando X-ray diffraction; Ti-Al-V-Fe","Alloying; Aluminum alloys; Aluminum compounds; Iron alloys; Microstructure; Powders; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Dual phase; In situ alloying; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Microstructural engineering; Operando; Operando X-ray diffraction; Powder bed; Ti-al-V-fe; X- ray diffractions; X ray diffraction","","","","","","","Thijs L., Verhaeghe F., Craeghs T., Van Humbeeck J., Kruth J.P., A study of the microstructural evolution during selective laser melting of Ti-6Al-4V, Acta Mater., 58, pp. 3303-3312, (2010); Simonelli M., Tse Y.Y., Tuck C., Effect of the build orientation on the mechanical properties and fracture modes of SLM Ti–6Al–4V, Mater.

This theory can be formally deduced from the two-temperature model and it can be treated as a generalized variant of the Guyer–Krumhansl model with the fourth order governing equation. We show that considered variant of the gradient theory allows to obtain useful singularity-free solutions for the moving point and line heat sources that can be used for the refined analysis of the melt pool shape in the laser powder bed fusion processes. Derived solutions contain single additional length scale parameter that can be related to the mean size of the powder particles . Namely, we show that developed gradient models allow to describe the decrease of the melt pool depth with the increase of the powder's particles size that was observed previously in the experiments. We also derived the dimensionless relations that can be used for the experimental identification of the model's length scale parameter for different materials. Semi-analytical solution for the Gaussian laser beam is also derived and studied based on the Green function method within the considered theory. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Analytical solutions; Gradient effects; Laser powder bed fusion; Melt pool morphology; Moving heat sources; Non-singular solutions","Gaussian beams; Heat transfer; Lakes; Laser beams; Laser theory; Particle size analysis; Analytical solution; Gradient effect; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Melt pool; Melt pool morphology; Moving heat sources; Non-singular solution; Powder bed; Singular solutions; Morphology","","","","","Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation, (FSFF-2020-0017)","This work was supported by Russian Ministry of Science and High Education , project number FSFF-2020-0017 .

The present study proposes a novel approach for accurately regulating the elastic, plastic, and energy absorption properties of thin-walled crystal plate lattices using plate holes. In order to identify the influence of plate holes on the programmable mechanical properties of thin-walled crystal plate lattices, numerical simulations as well as experimental tests were conducted. Without breaking the original symmetry features, the increasing size of plate holes only results in slightly increased elastically-anisotropy. Quasi-static uniaxial compression tests and simulations demonstrate the stiffness, yield strength, and energy absorption capability can be accurately regulated by plate holes. Elastoplastic finite element simulations are employed to reveal the mechanisms responsible for the mechanical response of thin-walled crystal plate lattices. All simulations are verified by mechanical tests of 316L stainless steel crystal plate lattices. This study provides a new channel for tunable mechanical performances of thin-walled crystal plate lattices. © 2022 The Authors","Finite element simulation; Laser powder bed fusion; Mechanical regulation;

However, the non-uniform and far-from-equilibrium heating/cooling conditions pose a significant challenge to consistently obtaining desirable phases in the as-printed parts. Here we report a martensite stainless steel development guided by phase transformation dynamics revealed by in-situ high-speed, high-energy, high-resolution X-ray diffraction. This developed stainless steel consistently forms desired fully martensitic structure across a wide range of cooling rates (102–107 ℃/s), which enables direct printing of parts with fully martensitic structure. The as-printed material exhibits a yield strength of 1157 ± 23 MPa, comparable to its wrought counterpart after precipitation-hardening heat-treatment. The as-printed property is attributed to the fully martensitic structure and the fine precipitates formed during the intrinsic heat treatment in additive manufacturing. The phase transformation dynamics guided alloy development strategy demonstrated here opens the path for developing reliable, high-performance alloys specific for additive manufacturing. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","17–4 PH stainless steel; Additive manufacturing; Laser processing; Phase transformation; Synchrotron X-ray diffraction","Additives; Dynamics; Heat treatment; Martensitic transformations; X ray diffraction; 17-4 PH stainless steel; Additive manufacturing technology; Alloy development; Complex parts; Laser process; Martensitic structures; Phase-transformation dynamics; Phases transformation; Synchrotron X-ray diffraction; X- ray diffractions; 3D printers","","","","","NSF-MRI, (DMR-0420532); ONR-DURIP, (N00014-0400798, N00014-0610539, N00014-0910781, N00014-1712870); SHyNE Resource, (ECCS-2025633); University of Wisconsin Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, (DMR-1720415); National Science Foundation, NSF, (CMMI-2011354); National Science Foundation, NSF; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; U.S. Department of Commerce, DOC; Office of Science, SC; Argonne National Laboratory, ANL, (DE-AC02-06CH11357); Argonne National Laboratory, ANL; University of Wisconsin-Madison, UW; Northwestern University, NU; College of Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison; Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, Harvard University, MRSEC, (NSF DMR-1720139); Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, Harvard University, MRSEC; Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, Northwestern University, MRSEC","Funding text 1: We thank Dr. Jan Ilavsky for his assistance with the SAXS measurement.

However, there have been only limited studies on the toughness performance of this promising alloy system. In the present work, the impact toughness of an LPBF-processed AlMgScZr alloy, which is critical for the application that involves high-strain-rate loading, was systematically investigated using instrumented Charpy impact testing. The results demonstrated that the AB(as-built)-LPBF-processed AlMgScZr alloy had a good combination of yield strength and impact toughness (338 ± 3 MPa, 27.47 ± 1.04 J), which were about 2 and 4 times those of the AC(as-cast)-processed AlMgScZr alloy (160 ± 1 MPa, 6.21 ± 0.66 J). However, post-aging treatment greatly deteriorated the impact toughness. On one hand, the strain-hardening capability of the LPBF-processed AlMgScZr alloy was reduced after post-aging; on the other hand, the coplanar slip associated with the L12 superlattice structure of the secondary Al3(Sc,Zr) phase promoted the intergranular brittle fracture. This resulted in the remarkable strength-impact toughness conflict in the AA(as-aged)-LPBF-processed AlMgScZr alloy (512 ± 2 MPa, 4.27 ± 0.09 J). This study not only provides valuable insights into the dynamic fracture resistance of the LPBF-processed AlMgScZr alloys but also sheds light on the importance of choosing whether to post-age the LPBF-processed AlMgScZr alloy based on service loading conditions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Al-Mg-Sc-Zr alloys; High strength; Impact toughness; Laser powder bed fusion","3D printers; Additives; Charpy impact testing; Fracture toughness; High strength alloys; Impact strength; Magnesium alloys; Scandium alloys; Strain hardening; Strain rate; Textures; Zircaloy; Alloy system; As-cast; Damage tolerant; High-strain-rate; High-strength; Instrumented charpy impact testing; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Performance; Powder bed; Aluminum alloys","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52105344); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Northwestern Polytechnical University, NPU, (040302, 2020-TZ-02); Northwestern Polytechnical University, NPU; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2022M710503); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2021A1515010942); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing, SKLSP; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFB1100104); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; Shanghai Aerospace Science and Technology Innovation Foundation, (SAST2018-066); Shanghai Aerospace Science and Technology Innovation Foundation","This work was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2016YFB1100104 ), Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China (No. 2022M710503 ), Research Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Solidification Processing (NPU) , China (Grant No. 2020-TZ-02 ), Advance Research Projects in the Field of Manned Spaceflight (Project No. 040302 ), Shanghai Aerospace Science and Technology Innovation Fund Project (Project No. SAST2018-066 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52105344 ), and Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (Grant No. 2021A1515010942 ).","Liu G., Zhang X.F., Chen X.L., He Y.H., Cheng L.Z., Huo M.K., Yin J.N., Hao F.Q., Chen S.Y., Wang P.Y., Yi S.H., Wan L., Mao Z.Y., Chen Z., Wang X., Cao Z.W., Lu J., Additive manufacturing of structural materials, Mater.

This paper experimentally demonstrates a non-intrusive structural health monitoring (SHM) framework capable of monitoring and modeling fatigue damage of 3DP structures. The experiments emulate realistic working conditions of machinery with polyethylene terephthalate beam parts as a subsystem. The pre-notched specimens with 0-, 45-, and 90-degree raster angles are manufactured and tested under highly irregular fatigue loads. Based on the phase space warping algorithm, the smooth orthogonal decomposition identifies the slow-time higher-order damage feature space, whose leading subspace is used as the estimated scalar-damage-time history. The critical inflection points (CIPs), identified in the higher-order damage feature subspace, delineate the three fatigue crack propagation stages with different rates of damage evolution. The lower-order projection of the CIPs in the damage-time histories can serve as early and late damage indicators, with a maximally 50% ahead of any observable signs of structural degradation from the response. The first CIP indicates the damage as early as at 10% of the total life span irrespective of the raster orientation. Based on a normalized temporal damage model, a hypothesis is posed to ascribe the raster angle-induced damage mechanisms to inter-laminar and cross-laminar fractures, validated by an optical-microscopy-based postmortem analysis. This paper provides an ad hoc alternative for studying fatigue damage with minimal assumptions and prior knowledge of the 3DP structure. Furthermore, the identified damage mechanisms suggest aligning the raster orientation with the applied stress to maximize the machinery's fatigue life. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3D printing; Fatigue crack propagation; Fatigue damage mechanism; Nonlinear vibrations; Phase space warping; Structural health monitoring","3D printers; Damage detection; Fatigue damage; Machinery; Phase space methods; Plastic bottles; Structural health monitoring; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Fatigue cracks propagation; Fatigue damage mechanism; High-order; Higher-order; Inflexion point; Non-linear vibrations; Phase space warping; Printed structures; Fatigue crack propagation","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1561960); National Science Foundation, NSF; University of Rhode Island, URI","This study is supported by the National Science Foundation, USA Grant No. 1561960 .

Understanding their mechanical response under various strain rates is essential to design and optimise them. Currently, the strain rate influence on the behaviour of AM materials is still not fully elucidated, nor is the corresponding metallurgical aspect. This research presents a comprehensive study on the influence of the microstructure and anisotropy of AlSi10Mg specimens made by Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) on their behaviour under various strain rates. Tensile specimens were fabricated in three orientations and tested at 0.001 s−1, 1 s−1, 500 s−1, and 1000 s−1 strain rates using a universal testing machine, intermediate strain rate mechanical device, and Split Hopkinson Pressure bar, respectively, combined with Digital Image Correlation. Fractography analysis revealed how the various dynamic loadings affected the failure modes and the corresponding microstructural evolution. Despite presenting low strain rate sensitivity and no evidence of strain hardening, the strain rate influenced the fracture response and elongation to failure. For higher strain rates, microstructural changes were captured on the fracture surfaces, suggesting a localised in-situ thermal treatment due to the adiabatic effect of high velocity loadings. © 2022 The Authors","AlSi10Mg; Hopkinson Bar; Impact; Laser Powder Bed Fusion; Microstructure; Strain Rate Sensitivity","Additives; Aerospace applications; Dynamic loads; Fracture; Fracture mechanics; Image correlation; Strain hardening; Strain rate; Stress-strain curves; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Hopkinson bar; Impact; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Mechanical response; Metallic structures; Plastic behavior; Powder bed; Strain-rate sensitivity; Strain-rates; Microstructure","","","","","","","Gong G., Ye J., Chi Y., Zhao Z., Wang Z., Xia G., Du X., Tian H., Yu H., Chen C., Research status of laser additive manufacturing for metal: a review, J.

In situ bioprinting is a method for printing bioinks directly into defective sites according to the shape and characteristics of the defective tissue or organ to promote tissue or organ repair. In this study, we applied a 3D bioprinting machine in situ bioprinting of epidermal stem cells (Epi-SCs), skin-derived precursors (SKPs), and Matrigel into the wounds of nude mice to promote hair follicle regeneration based on their native microenvironment. The results showed successful regeneration of hair follicles and other skin appendages at 4 weeks after in situ bioprinting. Moreover, we confirmed that bioprinting only slightly decreased stem cell viability and maintained the stemness of the stem cells. These findings demonstrated a mechanical engineering method for hair follicle regeneration by in situ bioprinting which has potential in the clinic. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Bioink; Epiderm stem cells; Hair follicle neogenesis; In situ bioprinting; Skin-derived precursors","Animals; Bioprinting; Hair Follicle; Mice; Mice, Nude; Quality of Life; Regeneration; Cell engineering; Cytology; Defects; Disease control; Mammals; Tissue; Bioink; Bioprinting; Epiderm stem cell; Hair follicle neogenesis; Hair follicles; Hair loss; In situ bioprinting; Quality of life; Skin-derived precursor; Stem-cell; animal; bioprinting; hair follicle; mouse; nude mouse; procedures; quality of life; regeneration; Stem cells","","","","","Introduced and Jointly Built High-end R&D Institute of Jiangxi, (20203CCH45008); Key Research and Development Projects of Chinese People's Liberation Army, (52075285, BWS17J036); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (32000956); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 32000956 ), the Key Research and Development Projects of Chinese People's Liberation Army (No. BWS17J036 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52075285 ), Introduced and Jointly Built High-end R&D Institute of Jiangxi (Grant No. 20203CCH45008 ).","Schneider M.R., Schmidt-Ullrich R., Paus R., The hair follicle as a dynamic miniorgan, Curr.

To achieve this, micro-pillar compression (in-situ) was conducted and the state of the materials under compression were correlated with respective stress–strain curves. A cast alloy of similar bulk composition was also investigated, under identical conditions, as a benchmark material. As opposed to the larger spherical grains (about 4 µm) of the cast alloy, the L-PBF alloy exhibited typical ‘melt pool’ meso-structure, combined with refined microstructure induced by rapid cooling and gave rise to sub-micron range grain sizes. The mechanical properties of the L-PBF alloy are anisotropic in nature, due to its bi-modal type meso- and micro-structure. Cross-sectional SEM investigation was carried out on deformed micro-pillars and revealed that there exist numerous slip and shear plane networks that served as load accommodation mechanism during compression.

This paper describes a Stereo Lithography Appearance (SLA) 3D printing method for creating hydrophobic surfaces. In this work, four different shapes of microstructures were prepared to observe the molding effect of the SLA process for the determination of the best printing structures. The contact angles of water droplet on the microarray surface were also measured through a contact angle meter with high-definition camera. The results show that the contact angles of different microarray surfaces were much better than the flat surfaces with chemical coating. Moreover, the cylindrical array shows the most stable hydrophobic effect with a maximum contact angle of 143.6°. The theoretical design and construction of surface wetting microstructures were also explored by calculating the minimum percentage of solid based on the Cassie-Baxter's wetting model. It is believed that the micro-cylindrical array could be adopted to promote the hydrophobic properties of material surfaces, which also indicates that the μ-SLA method could provide a new idea for the preparation of wettability surfaces. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Additive manufacturing; Cylindrical array; Hydrophobic microstructure; Polymers; SLA","3D printers; Contact angle; Hydrophobicity; Wetting; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Cylindrical arrays; Hydrophobic microstructure; Hydrophobic surfaces; Hydrophobics; Stereo lithography; Stereo lithography appearance; Surface preparation; Surface wettability; Microstructure","","","","","Opening Foundation of Shanxi Key Laboratory of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, (XJZZ202003); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai, (22ZR1402400); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai","This work is supported in by the Shanghai Natural Science Foundation ( 22ZR1402400 ) and the Opening Foundation of Shanxi Key Laboratory of Advanced Manufacturing Technology (No. XJZZ202003 ).

It leads to the penalty fee, credit amount, license extension, and reputation decline that could significantly impact future business outcomes. Existing approaches are unable to handle complex predictions that can accommodate the temporal influence of Quality of Service (QoS) data. Moreover, no method in a cloud environment considers all possible attitudinal behavior of the service provider to mitigate the risk of an actual violation. This article proposes an SLA violation risk mitigation model that uses ordered weighted average (OWA) in long short-term memory for complex QoS prediction. The OWA operator is weighted with a minimax disparity approach to manage the risk of SLA violation. The approach intelligently predicts deviation in custom prioritized QoS parameter and recommend exigency of mitigating action by considering all possible attitudinal behavior of the service provider. This article uses linguistic variables, fuzzy and interval numbers to handle imprecise information. The analysis results demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach to address complex risk mitigation actions.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Cloud computing; cloud risk management; fuzzy numbers (FNs); fuzzy-based decision making; intelligent risk management; linguistic decision making; predictive intelligence; Quality of Service (QoS)","Fuzzy sets; Linguistics; Long short-term memory; Quality of service; Risk assessment; Risk management; Cloud risk management; Cloud-computing; Decisions makings; Fuzzy numbers; Fuzzy-based decision making; Intelligent risk management; Linguistic decision making; Open wireless architectures; Predictive intelligence; Quality-of-service; Risks management; Servicelevel agreement (SLA); Decision making","","","","","","","Hussain W., Sohaib O., Naderpour M., Gao H., Cloud marginal resource allocation: A decision support model, Mobile Netw.

The designed and fabricated Diamond (DIA), Trifolium (TF), and Trishuriken (TS) lattice structures had high mechanical strength and Young's modulus similar to human cancellous bone. The pore size, porosity, compressive strength, and internal defect of the lattice structures are also discussed herein. According to the experimental observations, after the holding temperature at 950 °C for 1, 2, and 3 h, the grain sizes of TS500 samples were 3.59, 5.05 and 7.87 μm2, respectively. The compressive strength and ductility of these lattice structures changed significantly after the heat treatment. Two kinds of internal defects appeared in PBF production, namely, the powder that did not melt completely during printing and the micro-spherical pores caused by the residual gas. These were found concentrated at the middle location of the cross of the laser scanning path. Furthermore, the defect distribution can be detected through micro computed tomography. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Heat treatment; Internal defect; Laser powder bed fusion; Mechanical strength; Micro computed tomography; Ti-6Al–4V lattice Structure","Biocompatibility; Bone; Compressive strength; Computerized tomography; Defects; Elastic moduli; Heat treatment; Vacuum furnaces; Internal defects; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Lattice structures; Mechanical; Mechanical characteristics; Mechanical strength; Micro computed tomography; Powder bed; Ti-6al–4v lattice structure; Pore size","","","","","National Defense Medical Center, Taiwan; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (110-2221-E-027-076, 110-2622-E-027-032); Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST; Tri-Service General Hospital, TSGH","Funding text 1: This study is financially supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan under grant nos.

Two architecture configurations with Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) and Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) symmetry were taken into consideration. Finite element (FE) simulations based on representative volume element (RVE) models and cell-assembly models were conducted to investigate the elastic response and large deformation behavior of the hollow lattice materials, respectively. Afterwards, compression experiments were carried out on an electronic universal machine and a drop hammer (DH) system to explore the quasi-static and dynamic mechanical response of the lattice specimens. The complete deformation evolutions of the lattice samples under different loading velocities were captured through high-resolution photography and inspected by the digital imaging correlation (DIC) analysis. Both the experimental research and numerical simulations demonstrated that the hollow beam cross-sections contributed to the stable crushing response of the proposed lattice structures under either quasi-static or dynamic compression. Accordingly, the post-yield behavior of the tested lattice structures was quite smooth without any fluctuations. Meanwhile, the specific strength and energy absorption of the hollow lattice structures were found to be superior to many existed lattice materials with solid struts, and comparable with the reported triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) lattice structures. Finally, the effect of the geometric characteristic parameters on the specific mechanical properties of the lattice structures was discussed according to the supplemental analysis by numerical simulations. © 2022","Additive manufacturing;

In this study, a stainless-steel BP with a microchannel flow field is fabricated with a powder bed fusion (PBF) 3D printer to improve fuel cell performance. A BP with a triple serpentine flow field, rectangular channel, 300 μm channel width, 300 μm rib, and 500 μm channel depth is designed. The print is completed perfectly until the flow field. The bending phenomenon due to thermal deformation does not occur in the BP fabricated by designing the thickness at 2 mm. Performance tests are conducted using fabricated stainless-steel BPs. The current density value is 1.2052 A/cm2 at 0.6 V. This value is higher by 52.8% than the BP with 940 μm channels (rectangle, 940 μm ribs, and 500 μm channel depth). In addition, the value is higher by 24.9% than a graphite BP with 940 μm channels (rectangle, 940 μm ribs, and 1000 μm channel depth).

Here we reveal that additive manufacturing can exploit thermal cycling and rapid solidification to create ultrastrong and thermally stable titanium alloys, which may be directly implemented in service. As demonstrated in a commercial titanium alloy, after simple post-heat treatment, adequate elongation and tensile strengths over 1,600 MPa are achieved. The excellent properties are attributed to the unusual formation of dense, stable and internally twinned nanoprecipitates, which are rarely observed in traditionally processed titanium alloys. These nanotwinned precipitates are shown to originate from a high density of dislocations with a dominant screw character and formed from the additive manufacturing process. The work here paves the way to fabricate structural materials with unique microstructures and excellent properties for broad applications. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","3D printers; Additives; Heat treatment; High strength alloys; Precipitation (chemical); Rapid solidification; Tensile strength; Titanium castings; Aerospace sectors; Automotive sector; Energy sector; High-strength; Load-bearing; Nanotwinned; Property; Thermal-cycling; Thermomechanical processing; Titanium (alloys); Titanium alloys","","","","","Guotong AM Tech; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences; Monash Centre for Nanofabrication; Australian Research Council, ARC, (DE170100307); Australian Research Council, ARC; Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (QYZDJ-SSW-JSC031); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Funding text 1: We wish to acknowledge the use of instruments and scientific and technical assistance at the Monash Centre for Electron Microscopy (MCEM) as a Node of Microscopy Australia and the Monash Centre for Nanofabrication (MCN) in the Victorian Node of the Australian National Fabrication Facility (ANFF).

In both the as printed and directly aged conditions, the dendritic growth induced cellular structures constitute the unit microstructural features of the martensite; the martensitic transformation in these conditions occurs within the cell matrix and the cell boundaries act as the preferred sites for the austenite retention/reversion. The cell structures partially dissolve upon the austenitizing–aging heat treatment, while solutionizing fully erases them; both these heat treatments can facilitate the formation of the conventional packet–block–lath hierarchy, which is absent in the as printed and directed aged samples. Uniaxial tensile and mode I fracture toughness measurements reveal that the presence of the austenite in the directly aged M350 maraging steel lowers its strength but increases the fracture toughness. The absence of austenite in the other two heat treatment conditions results in high strength, but lower toughness. These findings shed light on understanding fundamental relationship between the unique features of the LPBF process and the martensitic transformation in maraging steels. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Fracture toughness; Heat treatment; Laser powder bed fusion; M350 maraging steel; Microstructure","Austenite; Biomechanics; Fracture toughness; Heat treatment; High strength steel; Linear transformations; Maraging steel; Martensitic transformations; Austenitizing; Condition; Direct aging; Effect of heat treatments; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; M350 maraging steel; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Powder bed; Solutionizing; Microstructure","","","","","Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR, (A18B1b0061); Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR","This work was supported by Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) of Singapore via the Structural Metal Alloys Programme (No. A18B1b0061 ).

The joining of this type of material requires a hole; and with reference to the available literature, the bearing strength requires investigation. In this context, three manufacturing processes were used for hole generation: direct printing, conventional drilling, and abrasive waterjet drilling (AWJ). The holes obtained by these manufacturing processes were characterized using X-ray tomography and a roughness system. Open-hole quasi-static and fatigue tests were used to assess the mechanical behavior of hole manufacturing on the tensile sections. Single-shear bearing tests yielded the same trend as that observed with open holes, where conventional drilling demonstrated higher performance than the printed and AWJ specimens. The absence of delamination and higher drilling temperature sealed the surface, thus limiting the influence of voids. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3-D Printing; Bolted joints; Continuous carbon fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites;

The ranges of relative electron density (from 0.843 to 1.079 HU) and X-ray density (from –160 to 100 HU) obtained for the study samples allow objects with characteristics corresponding to the known values of most human soft tissues and organs to be created (HU: –100-80; ρe: 0.949-1.052).

In the current work, Ti and Mn were inoculated simultaneously to the stainless steel 316 L by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) in-situ alloying. The local accumulation of the additions developed complexes of Ti-rich brittle phases that improved strength. Microstructural observations revealed the formation of intermetallic chunks of FeTi (bcc), σ (tetragonal), and C14 Laves phase (hcp) surrounded by emerged ferrite grains within the austenite. The rapid solidification of the molten tracks induced significant thermal stresses, which were responded by the generation of geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) at the austenite/ferrite interfaces, and activation of synchroshear mechanism within the Laves phase along with thermally activated slip systems in FeTi phase. Mn addition contributed to higher interface cohesion by facilitating dissociation of dislocations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Deformation mechanism; Grain refinement; In-situ alloying; Intermetallics; Mechanical properties; Microstructure","3D printers; Additives; Alloying; Austenite; Austenitic stainless steel; Binary alloys; Grain refinement; Manganese; Manganese alloys; Manganese steel; Rapid solidification; Titanium alloys; 'current; Deformation mechanism; Grain refining; Grains refinement; High Mn steels; In-situ alloying; Laser powders; Low stacking fault energies; Powder bed; Stainless steel (316L); Intermetallics","","","","","","","Qin H., Dong Q., Fallah V., Daymond M.R., Rapid solidification and non-equilibrium phase constitution in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) of AlSi10Mg alloy: analysis of nano-precipitates, eutectic phases, and hardness evolution, Metall.

Moreover, EPA allows the layer thickness to be reduced from around 100-150 μm, depending on respective particle size distribution, in the case of conventional doctor blade or roller-based powder application methods to the diameter of the applied polymer particles (typically between 50 and 130 μm). This can have positive effects on the interlayer connection and, therefore, the mechanical properties of the additively manufactured part because less powder volume has to be fused with the already generated underlying part. Moreover, due to the above-mentioned independence of EPA from powder flowability, the addition of flow aids, such as nano silica, can be reduced to a minimum or even avoided completely. This is the first comprehensive study on resulting properties of parts generated by PBF-LB/P using EPA taking into account both the reduction in layer thickness and reduced addition of flow aids. In addition to improving mechanical properties of generated parts, the independence of powder flowability, in particular, offers the possibility of qualifying currently unsuitable materials for PBF-LB/P. For this purpose, besides widely employed polyamide 12 (PA12), a polypropylene (PP) powder is used that is very difficult to process in conventional PBF-LB/P and can only be applied there with the help of flow aids.  © 2022 Author(s).","","Compressive strength; Particle size analysis; Polypropylenes; Silica; Application behaviors; Decouplings; Higher efficiency; Laser-based; Layer thickness; Multi-material part; Powder bed; Powder consumption; Powder flowability; Powder properties; Particle size","","","","","Collaborative Research Center 814, (CRC 814); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (61375930); Erlangen Graduate School of Advanced Optical Technologies, SAOT; Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Wissenschaft und Kunst, STMWK","The authors gratefully acknowledge funding of the Collaborative Research Center 814 (CRC 814), sub-project B6, by the German Research Foundation (DFG)—Project No. 61375930— and of the Erlangen Graduate School in Advanced Optical Technologies (SAOT) by the Bavarian State Ministry for Science and Art.","Huang S.H., Liu P., Mokasdar A., Hou L., Additive manufacturing and its societal impact: A literature review, Int.

A mould manufacturer was using traditional manufacturing approaches to fabricate injection moulds. The traditional approach compromised the competitiveness of the organisation, resulting in a lower production rate and high operational costs owing to lengthy changeover times. Given several alternatives, the aim of this study was to determine the best suitable additive manufacturing technology for the manufacture of moulds. The analytic hierarchical process was deployed as the method to compare and select the best 3D printing technology from among recent additive manufacturing (AM) technologies that would meet surface finish, dimensional accuracy, cost, and manufacturing lead time requirements. Four AM options were multilevel concurrent printing, MELD technology, a Metal Jet 3D printer, and VELO3D. The final results indicated that the VELO3D was better than the other additive manufacturing technologies for the manufacture of moulds. © 2022, Southern African Institute for Industrial Engineering.

In the aviation industry, the influence of process variables and post-treatment processes on additive manufacturing technology has been studied extensively. In this study, the mechanical properties of aircraft parts made of Ti6Al4V powder and their suitability for applications involving aircraft were reviewed. A specimen was prepared and tested; then its microstructure was analyzed and compared with Ti6Al4V plate material. Selected mechanical properties were reviewed. The target product was fabricated using the same process parameters under the same conditions as used for the specimen. The influence analyses of the build orientation and post-processing were performed by dividing the build orientation of the target product into three parts. The shape deformation that occurred after post-processing was reviewed. In addition, the adequacy of the target product to resist the required loads was determined through a functional test of the product. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Korean Society for Aeronautical & Space Sciences.","3D printing; AM (additive manufacturing); DMLS (direct metal laser sintering); SLM (selective laser melting)","Additives; Aircraft; Aluminum alloys; Laser heating; Selective laser melting; Selective laser sintering; Sintering; Ternary alloys; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Additive manufacturing; Aircraft parts; Build orientation; Direct metal laser sintering; Post-processing; Selective laser melting; Titanium alloys","","","","","Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE, (20004662); Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, MOTIE; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2022M1A3C2074536); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology, KEIT; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work was supported by the Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology (KEIT) grant funded by the Korea government (MOTIE: Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy) (No. 20004662, Industrial Technology Innovation Project).

The goal was to develop an easily printable material with similar performance to 18Ni-300. After screening numerous compositions, Fe-13.2Cr-9.1Ni-1.1Al-0.6Mo-0.5Nb-0.23Ti-0.5Mn-0.5Si (wt.%) was selected. This composition showed excellent printability with low porosity levels. The precipitation strengthening response was evaluated by aging at 500 °C for 15 min, 3 h and 18 h, measuring hardness, tensile strength, and by characterization using atom probe tomography. After 15 min of aging, 90% of the maximum hardness was reached, thanks to formation of (Ni, Al, Nb, Ti, Mn, Si) clusters with a density of 1.5 × 1024 m-3. Between 15 min and 3 h, distinct precipitates formed with a radius of ∼1.4 nm. The precipitates underwent a splitting phenomenon after 18 h, forming several unique Ni-rich precipitates including Ni16Si7(Ti, Nb)6 and Ni3(Al, Ti, Nb, Si). The splitting can be a reason for the slow coarsening rate, as the average precipitate radius after 18 h was only 2 nm. Simulations of the precipitation sequence using PRISMA indicated very rapid and dense precipitation of L12-Ni3X precipitates with a slow coarsening rate, in agreement with experimental observations. © 2022 The Authors","Additive; Alloy design; APT; LB-PBF; Maraging; Precipitates","Hardness; Maraging steel; Molybdenum compounds; Niobium compounds; Ostwald ripening; Stainless steel; Tensile strength; Alloy designs; APT; Coarsening rates; Cobalt free; Laser-based; LB-PBF; Maraging; Powder bed; Splittings; Stainless maraging steels; Coarsening","","","","","Centre for Additive Manufacturing – Metal; Swedish Governmental Agency","Funding text 1: This work has been conducted in the framework of the Centre for Additive Manufacturing – Metal (CAM2), supported by the Swedish Governmental Agency of Innovation Systems (Vinnova).

The PCL-based BRS and pressure sensor are fabricated using a custom-designed additive manufacturing method and a modified photolithography technique. Firstly, we optimized the additive manufacturing fabrication parameters to realize the highly reliable scaffold with uniform strut width and thickness. Then, utilizing the optimized additive manufacturing conditions, we fabricated three distinct types of scaffolds, namely scaffold A, scaffold B, and scaffold C, each with a unique architecture. The preliminary characteristics of the fabricated scaffolds demonstrated that the scaffold A architecture exhibited superior properties, including 0.048 N mm−1 radial force, 1.64% foreshortening, and 14.1% recoil compared to the scaffolds B and C. The Inductor-Capacitor (LC)-pressure sensor is integrated into the PCL-based BRS using a water-soluble polyvinyl alcohol adhesive layer. The reliability of the fabricated LC-pressure sensor is confirmed by measuring its change capacitance and resonance frequency at different applied pressures. The proposed LC-pressure sensor integrated PCL-based BRS is evaluated in a pressure range of 0-280 mmHg. The resonant frequency of the fabricated smart scaffold changed linearly according to the pressure change indicating the high reliability of the proposed smart scaffold. We anticipate that the proposed pressure sensor integrated with the biodegradable PCL-based BRS would be used for biomedical applications owing to their facile fabrication process and excellent sensitivity. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.","additive manufacturing; bioresorbable scaffold; cardiac catheterization; polycaprolactone scaffold; pressure sensor","3D printers; Additives; Adhesives; Blood pressure; Diagnosis; Fabrication; Medical applications; Natural frequencies; Bioresorbable scaffolds; Cardiac catheterizations; Fabrication parameters; Manufacturing conditions; Manufacturing methods; Polycaprolactone scaffolds; Property; Radial forces; Watersoluble; Wireless pressure sensors; Pressure sensors","","","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (2020R1A5A8018367); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2020R1A5A8018367).

For the first time, 3DP-UHPC slab, 3DP-UHPC reinforced normal concrete (PURN) slabs are tested against contact explosions. Explosion resistances with regard to different reinforcing methods, layer thickness ratios and construction methods for base materials are investigated. Specifically, PURN, steel bar reinforced 3DP-UHPC (RU), steel bar reinforced normal concrete (RC), and normal concrete (NC) slabs of similar sizes are constructed to compare the explosion resistances. Different reinforcing layer thickness are attempted. From the contact explosion tests, it exhibits that the extrusion-based 3D printing procedure enhances the explosion resistance substantially via fiber orientation alignment. With the layer thickness ratio of 40% (PURN6) as the watershed, both the top and bottom surface crater diameters of PURN slabs increase first and then decrease with increasing reinforcing layer thickness. In particular, crater diameters and failure modes for PURN8 and PURN15 are consistent with those of RC and RU, respectively. The underlying mechanism for the fibers to be aligned by the 3D printing procedure is theoretically analyzed to support the conclusions. The material costs of all the slabs are compared. The costs of PURN8 and PURN15 are 1.7 and 0.8 times of those for RC and RU, respectively. Thus, it can be stated that the 3D extrusion-based printing procedure will avail explosion resistance for 3DP-UHPC. Current test results prove the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of PURN for protective structures. © 2022","3D concrete printing; 3D printing ultra-high performance concrete (3DP-UHPC); Composite slab; Contact explosion; Fiber orientation; Punching shear failure","3D printers; Bars (metal); Cost effectiveness; Extrusion; Failure (mechanical); Fibers; High performance concrete; Reinforced concrete; 3-D printing; 3d concrete printing; 3d printing ultra-high performance concrete; 3D-printing; Composite slab; Concrete printings; Contact explosion; Fibre orientation; Punching shear; Punching shear failure; Shear failure; Explosions","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51878241, 52078181, 52178198); Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province, (E2021202039, E2022202041); Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City, (20JCYBJC00710)","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 51878241 , no. 52078181 , and no. 52178198 ), Natural Science Foundation of Hebei (No. E2021202039 and E2022202041), and Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin (No. 20JCYBJC00710).","Du J., Meng W., Khayat K.H., Bao Y., Guo P., Lyu Z., Abu-obeidah A., Nassif H., Wang H., New development of ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC), Composit Part B, 224, (2021); Ye J., Cui C., Yu J., Yu K., Xiao J., Fresh and anisotropic-mechanical properties of 3D printable ultra-high ductile concrete with crumb rubber, Composit Part B, 211, (2021); Li Z., Wang L., Ma G., Mechanical improvement of continuous steel microcable reinforced geopolymer composites for 3D printing subjected to different loading conditions, Composit Part B, 187, (2020); Li J., Wu Z., Shi C., Yuan Q., Zhang Z., Durability of ultra-high performance concrete – A review, Constr Build Mater, 255, (2020); Bajaber M.A., Hakeem I.Y., UHPC evolution, development, and utilization in construction: a review, J Mater Res Technol, 10, pp. 1058-1074, (2021); Goswami A., Adhikary S.D., Retrofitting materials for enhanced blast performance of Structures: Recent advancement and challenges ahead, Constr Build Mater, 204, pp. 224-243, (2019); Draganic H., Gazic G., Varevac D., Experimental investigation of design and retrofit methods for blast load mitigation – a state-of-the-art review, Eng Struct, 190, pp. 189-209, (2019); Peng Y., Wu C., Li J., Liu J., Liang X., Mesoscale analysis on ultra-high performance steel fibre reinforced concrete slabs under contact explosions, Compos Struct, 228, (2019); Li J., Wu C., Hao H., Investigation of ultra-high performance concrete slab and normal strength concrete slab under contact explosion, Eng Struct, 102, pp. 395-408, (2015); Li J., Wu C., Hao H., Wang Z., Su Y., Experimental investigation of ultra-high performance concrete slabs under contact explosions, Int J Impact Eng, 93, pp. 62-75, (2016); Su Q., Wu H., Sun H.S., Fang Q.

By introducing sacrificial non-covalent hydrogen bonding within the polymer network, the printed SMPs exhibit excellent mechanical performance in the glassy state, e.g., a toughness of 38.3 ± 4.3 MJ m−3, Young's modulus of 1.1 ± 0.1 GPa, breaking stress of 46.2 ± 1.9 MPa, and strain-at-break of 99 ± 14%. The multiple shape memory capability is derived from a single broad glass transition (ranging from 70 °C to 150 °C) introduced during the formulation of the resin. The printed tough multi-SMPs can be potentially applied as smart devices where both good mechanical performance and precise control of complex shape transformation are needed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Broad glass transition; Multi-SMP; Shape memory polymer; Tough","3D printers; Elastic moduli; Glass; Hydrogen bonds; Photopolymerization; Shape-memory polymer; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Broad glass transition; Mechanical performance; Multi shapes; Multi-shape memory polymer; Photo polymerization; Shape memory polymers; Tough; Glass transition","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52103292); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Zhejiang University, ZJU; State Key Laboratory of Chemical Engineering","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank the following programs for their financial support: the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52103292 ).

However, clinical practice calls for balanced material properties besides a patient-matched geometry, including good biocompatibility, low elastic modulus, good material strength and enhanced wear resistance. This study demonstrates an in-situ microscale composition modulation method by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) using a Mo2C/Ti powder mixture, achieving adaptive microstructure and successfully combining balanced mechanical and wear properties in the Ti-7.5Mo-2.4TiC composites. The modulation is made through partial homogenisation of raw materials, leaving entangled Mo-rich and Mo-poor streaks around the molten pool boundary and a Ti–Mo matrix at the molten pool centre. By optimising volumetric energy density to 82.3 J/mm3, the modulated composition inhomogeneity produces an alternately laminated microstructure with entangled α and β streaks around the molten pool boundary and mixed α+β phases at the molten pool centre. Such that the molten pool boundary reveals a lower elastic modulus relative to the molten pool centre. The uneven allocation of elastic moduli throughout layers of molten pools enables a step-by-step deformation mode under compressive loading, lowering the component-related elastic modulus to 90.4 ± 2.1 GPa; on the other hand, it suppresses crack propagation, extending the material's elongation to 16.4 ± 1.4%. The synergistic effect of grain refinement and dispersion strengthening provided by in-situ precipitated TiC improves yield strength (936.9 ± 19.8 MPa) and ultimate compressive strength (1415.5 ± 23.1 MPa). The hard TiC also enhances the wear property, obtaining lower wear rates (down to 8.6 × 10−4 mm3N−1m−1) than the pure Ti. The balanced mechanical and wear properties could expand the potential of this composite in clinical use. More importantly, this LPBF-based approach creates a pathway for microscale composition modulation in material design and performance customisation towards biomedical applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF); Mechanical properties; Metal matrix composites (MMCs); Microstructural modulation; Wear properties","Biocompatibility; Compressive strength; Elastic moduli; Grain refinement; Laminated composites; Medical applications; Metallic matrix composites; Microstructure; Mixtures; Modulation; Powder metals; Titanium alloys; Wear of materials; Wear resistance; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Matrix composite; Metal matrix; Metal matrix composite; Micro-structural; Microstructural modulation; Molten pool; Powder bed; Wear properties; Titanium carbide","","","","","KU Leuven; China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201806830109)","Funding text 1: The author, Qimin Shi, gratefully acknowledges the financial support from the China Scholarship Council (No. 201806830109).

In this study, we made a detailed investigation into the deformation behavior of GB-α with different morphologies in a laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) fabricated Ti-6Al-4V (Ti-64) by using in-situ and interrupted tensile testing, and discussed the underlying mechanisms of dislocation motion. The deformation-induced dislocations were found severely accumulated within the continuous GB-α with the transverse loading direction, which corresponds to the strain localization, while uniformly distributed between the continuous GB-α and surrounding grains with the perpendicular tensile loading. In contrast, discontinuous GB-α could fully accommodate uniform deformation with the matrix microstructure under both loading directions. The new understanding of dislocation motions in GB-α provides a novel perspective to effectively eliminate the tensile property anisotropy with the columnar microstructure present in LPBF Ti-64. © 2022 The Author(s)","Deformation behavior; Grain boundary α-phase; In-situ tensile test; Laser powder bed fusion; Ti-6Al-4V","3D printers; Aluminum alloys; Anisotropy; Deformation; Microstructure; Morphology; Tensile testing; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Deformation behavior; Dislocation motion; Grain boundary α-phase; Grain-boundaries; In-situ tensile test; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Loading direction; Powder bed; Ti-6al-4v; Grain boundaries","","","","","Sailing Program, (20YF1431600); University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, USST","This research work was sponsored by Sailing Program (20YF1431600) and internal funding from Univeristy of Shanghai for Science and Technology.

The results indicate that high-density Ti3Al precipitates were formed, and the decomposition of α'→α + β occurred during the aging treatments. A higher aging-hardening response of the studied alloy was achieved after the β solution treatment relative to the as-built state. The worn morphologies and wear mechanisms depend significantly on the microstructural characteristics, applied loads, and sliding velocities. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Heat treatment; Titanium alloy; Tribological behavior","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Heat treatment; Ternary alloys; Tribology; Vanadium alloys; Wear of materials; Ageing treatments; Direct aging; Direct solution; Laser powders; Microstructural characteristics; Powder bed; Sliding velocities; Solution-aging; Titanium (alloys); Tribological behaviour; Titanium alloys","","","","","Graduate Training and Innovation Practice Base of Hunan Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52074114, 52174361); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Central South University, CSU; China Scholarship Council, CSC, (202106130051); China Scholarship Council, CSC; State Key Laboratory of Powder Metallurgy, SKLPM","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 52174361 , 52074114 ) and Graduate Training and Innovation Practice Base of Hunan Province , and State Key Laboratory of Powder Metallurgy , Central South University , Changsha, China.

Additive manufacturing is recognized as an essential element in driving I4.0 in automotive industries. Among additive manufacturing processes, wire-arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) has a wide range of applications in automotive industries. Moreover, in comparison to other fusion processes, WAAM provides a higher deposition rate and substantial cost savings. However, it possesses several challenges in integration with I4.0 that need to be addressed for its smooth adoption in industries. Thus, in this study, an analysis of WAAM and I4.0 challenges has been done using the graph theory (GT) approach. Potential 54 challenges of WAAM and I4.0 integration grouped in seven categories were recognized using literature review and expert opinion. GT approach helps in establishing the logical and systematic diagrammatic representation of entire integration systems in the form of interrelationships among various integration challenges. Based on the permanent values, it has been observed that the “technology (C7)” category performs a significant role in intensifying the WAAM-I4.0 integration adoption in the case of an organization, whereas the challenges category “pre-processing C3” requires less but significant attention while implementing WAAM in I4.0. The study also measured the overall intensity of the challenges in the form of a comprehensive intensity index (CII) which was found to be “59.0495,” which denotes the intensity of the WAAM and I4.0 integration challenges require careful attention for its smooth adoption in the case organization. Industry practitioners can utilize the findings of the study to innovate existing additive manufacturing systems with the advanced capability of I4.0. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Additive manufacturing; Challenges; Graph theory approach; Industry 4.0; Wire-arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Automotive industry; Deposition rates; Graph theory; Integration; Wire; Additive manufacturing process; Advanced informations; Challenge; Essential elements; Graph theory approach; Industrial revolutions; Manufacturing IS; Production system; Wire arc; Wire-arc additive manufacturing; Industry 4.0","","","","","","","Stavropoulos P., Foteinopoulos P., Papacharalampopoulos A., Bikas H., Addressing the challenges for the industrial application of additive manufacturing: towards a hybrid solution, Int J Lightweight Mater Manuf, 1, pp. 157-168, (2018); Rodrigues T.A., Duarte V., Miranda R.M., Et al., Current status and perspectives on wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM), Materials, 12, 7, (2019); Jafari D., Vaneker T.H.J., Gibson I., Wire and arc additive manufacturing: opportunities and challenges to control the quality and accuracy of manufactured parts, Mater Des, 202, (2021); Wankhede V.A., Vinodh S., Application of total interpretive structural modeling for analyzing factors of additive manufacturing and industry 4.0 integration, Rapid Prototyp J, 27, pp. 1591-1608, (2021); Thapliyal S., Challenges associated with the wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) of aluminum alloys, Mater Res Express, 6, (2019); Anand M., Bishwakarma H., Kumar N., Et al., Fabrication of multilayer thin wall by WAAM technique and investigation of its microstructure and mechanical properties, Mater Today Proc, 56, pp. 927-930, (2022); Vora J., Parmar H., Chaudhari R., Khanna S., Doshi M., Patel V.V., Experimental investigations on mechanical properties of multi-layered structure fabricated by GMAW-based WAAM of SS316L, J Mater Res Technol, 20, pp. 2748-2757, (2022); Mourtzis D., Fotia S., Boli N., Vlachou E., Modelling and quantification of industry 4.0 manufacturing complexity based on information theory: a robotics case study, Int J Prod Res, 57, pp. 6908-6921, (2019); Stavropoulos P., Lianos A.K., Bikas H., Mourtzis D., Skills requirements for the 4th industrial revolution: the additive manufacturing case, MATEC Web Conf, 318, (2020); Azarian M., Yu H., Solvang W.D., Integrating additive manufacturing into a virtual Industry 4.0 factory, Advanced Manufacturing and Automation X.

The ligament size of NPCs could be adjusted by applying different VPD temperatures under high vacuum, while the change in the mechanical properties of NPCs were monitored by compression tests. Although NPCs possessed a random ligament structure, the energy absorption capability of NPCs was up to 183.3 MJ/m3, which is an order higher than that of other Cu foam structures fabricated by different methods such as 3D printing, electron beam melting, electro-deposition, chemical dealloying and friction powder compaction. High apparent relative density and ligament connectivity could effectively transmit the compression energy in the form of stress waves, and therefore had higher densification strain and better energy absorption capacity. With the use of corrected Gibson and Ashby scaling equation, the ligament strength of NPC was up to 3456 MPa, which was ten times higher than that of bulk Cu and comparable to that of other ordered or periodic copper foams. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Copper; Energy absorption; Mechanical testing; Nanoporous structure; Vapor phase dealloying","3D printers; Binary alloys; Compression testing; Copper; Dealloying; Morphology; Zinc alloys; Dealloying; Ligament sizes; Nano-porous coppers; Nanoporous structures; Relative density; Synthesised; Vapor Phase; Vapor phase dealloying; Vapor phasis; Vapour-phase; Energy absorption","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (MOST-110-2222-E-002-004-MY2); National Taiwan University, NTU","Funding text 1: This project was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, under MOST-110-2222-E-002-004-MY2.

The strain rate dependent plasticity of as-built AlSi10Mg laser powder bed fusion samples was systematically studied as a function of stress state (tension and compression) and strain rate at 293 and 78 K. Utilizing constant strain-rate and rate-change testing methodologies, a strong dependence of flow stress on strain rate was revealed for both stress states. The compressive yield stresses have a potent strain rate sensitivity in both quasi-static (10−4-10−1 s−1) and medium-dynamic (1-5 s−1) strain rate regimes. A positive strain rate sensitivity was observed in all strain rates except for a shift to negative values in the 10−2-10−1 s−1 range for both tensile and compression states. This negative strain rate sensitivity was correlated with the deformation-induced microstructural evolution, i.e., manifested as a gradual transition in the dominant dislocation-precipitate interaction mechanism from shearing to looping, along with the disappearance of dislocation-solute interaction in the form of dynamic strain aging (DSA). The precise measurement of activation volume evolution with flow stress further confirmed the transition from shearing to looping in the 10−2-10−1 s−1 range. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","AlSi10Mg; Deformation; Dislocation; LPBF; Microstructure; Strain rate","Microstructure; Plastic flow; Shearing; Yield stress; Dislocation; Dislocation obstacles; Laser powders; LPBF; Microstructural features; Powder bed; Rate-dependent plasticity; Strain-rate sensitivity; Strain-rates; Stress state; Strain rate","","","","","Toyal America, Inc.; Toyo Aluminum K.K.‘s branch in North America; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","The authors would like to acknowledge the NSERC Discovery Grant program for the financial support, and Toyal America, Inc.

It was prepared by compressing waste metal chips obtained from the conventional machining processes into a flat plate or any desired shape. It could be disintegrated after the deposition, ensuring ease of part removal. Fused metal chips on the bottom layer require minimal post-processing. A fibre laser and two other arc-based heat sources were used to demonstrate the swarf substrate viability for additive manufacturing. Low alloy steel (ER70S-6) and Inconel 625 were used in this study. Melt pool penetration in swarf substrate was observed to be unique and typically formed a tree root structure after solidification. This structure provides strength for holding the further layers upright. The working parameters were optimised for uniform and continuous deposition. Material integrity was confirmed by hardness study comparison with similar parts deposited on the conventional solid substrate. The dilution of swarf material (typically mild steel) was observed to be limited within 2–3 mm layer height, as confirmed by the Energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The cooling rate was found to be decreasing with layer height and saturated after few initial layers of the deposition similar to the conventional solid substrate. Excellent formability of the swarf substrate allowed to utilise it for unique applications such as deposition of curved features and support structure. The presented work demonstrates additive manufacturing of parts using such geometrical features, including coil spring and alloy wheel. © 2022 CIRP","Additive manufacturing; Curved features; Support structure; Swarf substrate; WAAM; WLAM","3D printers; Additives; Alloy steel; Deposition; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Fiber lasers; Ground supports; Machining; Plate metal; Steel fibers; Additive manufacturing process; Curved feature; Manufacturing applications; Metal chips; Solid substrates; Support structures; Swarf substrate; WAAM; Waste metals; WLAM; Substrates","","","","","Science and Engineering Research Board, SERB, (CRG/2020/001068)","This work was supported by the DST , Science and Engineering Research Board , India [ CRG/2020/001068 ] under the CRG scheme.

In this work, we applied stereolithography to print a microspiral inductor mold and fabricated microspiral inductors with 2.5, 4.5, and 6.5 turns by injecting eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn), which is a liquid metal. Based on a reconstruction model (obtained by reconstructing micro-computed tomography data), an algorithm was established for a nondestructive measurement of the structural parameters of the inductors. The electrical performance of the inductors was tested by conducting physical experiments and then characterized by simulating the reconstructed model. The measurement results of the structural parameters showed that the processing error of the wire diameter could be controlled within 20%; the machining error of the other structural parameters could be well controlled within 5%, with a high molding accuracy. Compared to the theoretical model results, the simulation results based on the reconstructed model showed improvement in the accuracy of the inductance values by 20.5, 16.8, and 7.6%, the accuracy of the Q factor by 13.2, 20.7, and 19.5%, and the accuracy of the self-resonant frequencies by 9.3, 6.31, and 8%, respectively. © 2022, ASM International.","additive manufacturing; electrical performance characterization; microCT data; microspiral inductor; nondestructive measurement; structural parameters","Additives; Computerized tomography; Electric inductors; Natural frequencies; Nondestructive examination; Parameter estimation; Q factor measurement; Computed tomography data; Electrical performance; Electrical performance characterization; Micro CT; Microct data; Microspiral inductor; Non-destructive measurement; Performance characterization; Processing quality; Structural parameter; 3D printers","","","","","","","Shen J., Zeng Z., Nematollahi M., Schellet N., Maawad E., Vasin R.N., Safaei K., Poorganji B., Elahinia M., Oliveira J.P., In-situ Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction Analysis of the Elastic Behaviour of Martensite and H-Phase in a NiTiHf Shape Memory Alloy Fabricated by Laser Powder Bed Fusion, Addit.

The conductive materials are flux-cored solder wires Sn60Pb40 and Sn99Ag0.3Cu0.7. The deposition was achieved with a specially adapted nozzle. A comparison of solder wires with and without flux cores is discussed to determine whether the solder alloys exhibit adequate wettability and adhesion to the polymer substrate.

Firstly, the influence of the transient sound field and detection positions on Rayleigh wave signals are investigated. The interactions between the varied microdefects and the laser ultrasonic are studied. It is shown that arrival time of reflected Rayleigh (RR) waves wave is only related to the location of defects. The depth can be checked from the feature point Q, the displacement amplitude and time delay of converted transverse (RS) wave, while the width information can be evaluated from the RS wave time delay. With the aid of fitting curves, it is found to be linearly related. This simulation study provides a theoretical basis for quantitative detection of surface microdefects of additive manufactured 316L stainless steel components. © 2022","Laser ultrasonic; Metal additive manufacturing; Numerical simulation; Surface defects","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51605340); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFB1103900); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2017YFB1103900 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51605340 ).","Li N., Huang S., Zhang G.D., Et al., Progress in additive manufacturing on new materials: a review, J.

However, traditional experimental trial-and-error methods to determine process parameters for specific materials and L-PBF machines are time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, a phenomenological crystallization model, namely the Nakamura model, is coupled with L-PBF process simulation. A convenient approach for the crystallization parameter determination and a two-step Euler method for the numerical implementation has been developed. Numerical simulations are performed using the material parameters of a Zr-based BMG Zr59.3Cu28.8Al10.4Nb1.5 (at.%, trade name: AMZ4). The numerical results are validated by comparing with experimental results from different perspectives. Based on the numerical findings, a comprehensive understanding of BMG crystallization behavior during L-PBF is gained. In the end, the crystallization model is implemented in our in-house developed software SAMPLE2D. SAMPLE2D simulation results are presented, whereby the L-PBF process window for fully amorphous AMZ4 parts is explored. Thereby, it is believed that the developed numerical software can be applied to aid process development for BMGs by taking the crystallization phenomenon into account. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; Bulk metallic glass; Crystallization; Laser powder bed fusion; Nakamura model","3D printers; Aluminum alloys; Copper alloys; Glass; Metallic glass; Numerical methods; Zircaloy; Bulk metallic glass; Crystallization modeling; Experimental trials; Fusion process; Glass crystallization; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Nakamurum model; Powder bed; Predictive simulations; Crystallization","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (61375930); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG","The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the German Research Foundation (DFG) within the Collaborative Research Center 814 Additive Manufacturing, Project T2 (Project ID 61375930).

This involves prioritising mechanical strength in areas of structural significance and high volumetric build rates in areas of low structural significance. In theory, a component with similar mechanical behaviour to that seen in standard Laser Powder Bed Fusion parts can be built in significantly less time and at a reduced cost. In practice however, the boundary between such regions is yet to be understood and discretising components into sub-volumes can induce interfacial defects. In this study, an in-depth analysis of interfaces between disparate layer thickness volumes in single components has been explored, to gain information vital to solving interface quality issues so that LPBF design freedoms can be fully exploited. A novel 3D reconstruction technique has been demonstrated to characterise transient plastic behaviour of interfacial pores post-fracture. This technique enables post-mortem evaluation of additively manufactured parts and tracking of pore deformation during subsequent mechanical testing. X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) identified interfacial pores up to 170 µm Feret diameter, with a voxel resolution of 6 µm. Micro tensile testing with in-situ microscopy exhibited a real-time mechanical response, observing evidence that these interfacial defects lead to fracture at interface locations. The 3D reconstruction technique found that pores constricted 10.0 – 14.1% in the x direction and 10.3 – 14.6% in the y direction after fracture – normal to the loading direction. These findings contribute towards improving Additively Manufactured biomedical implants and airframe components with reduced time and cost. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Laser Powder Bed Fusion; Layer thickness; Porosity; Productivity; X-ray computed tomography","3D printers; Additives; Computerized tomography; Defects; Fracture; Image reconstruction; Laser theory; Matrix algebra; Productivity; Quality control; 3D reconstruction; Design freedom; Interfacial defect; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Layer thickness; Post mortem; Powder bed; Reconstruction techniques; X-ray computed tomography; Tensile testing","","","","","Oerlikon AM GmbH; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; Royal Academy of Engineering, RAENG, (RCSRF1920/9/27)","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge funding from Oerlikon AM GmbH and EPSRC .

This effect can be used to create shape-changing structures in 3D printing. Hence, wood fibre reinforced filaments have the potential to be used in four-dimensional (4D) printing. In this work, biocomposites based on granulated or milled thermomechanical pulp (TMP) fibres and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) were prepared and evaluated based on their tensile properties. Poly(hydroxyalkanoates) (PHA) or poly(butylene-adipate-terephthalate) (PBAT) were included in the biocomposite recipes to assess their effect on the melt flow index (MFI) and tensile properties. Clear effects of the TMP fibre morphology on MFI were quantified. Biocomposites containing 20 wt% PBAT turned out to be stronger and tougher than the ones containing PHA. Based on that, filaments for 3D and 4D printing were manufactured. Interestingly, the tensile strength of 3D printed specimens containing milled TMP (TMPm) fibres was about 33% higher compared to those containing TMP fibre granulate (TMPg). Using hot water as the stimulus, the 3D printed specimens containing TMPg showed a greater reactivity and shape change compared to TMPm specimens. © 2022 The Authors","4D printing; Biocomposites; Material extrusion; Mechanical characterization; Wood fibres","Butenes; Fibers; Lactic Acid; Printing; Samples; Tensile Strength; Thermomechanical Pulps; Wood Products; Butenes; Fibers; Lactic acid; Thermomechanical pulp; Wood products; 4d printing; Biocomposite; Material extrusion; Mechanical characterizations; Poly lactic acid; Poly(butylene adipate); Polybutylene adipate; Pulp fibers; Terephthalate; Woodfiber; Tensile strength","","","","","Norges Forskningsråd, (282310)","The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests:Gary Chinga-Carrasco reports financial support was provided by Research Council of Norway, Grant no. 282310.

The present work investigates the impact of incorporation of hexagon lattice structure on the walnut shell/PLA polymeric composite material using the Fused Deposition Modelling method. The printing process parameters such as nozzle temperature, layer height, infill density, and printing speed are varied to optimize the tensile and dimensional area error properties. Taguchi optimization technique is employed to find the optimal printing condition for the effective experimental output responses. The results from the experiments clearly show that the maximum tensile strength of 2.684 MPa was observed on the optimized printing condition of nozzle temperature of 210℃, a layer height of 0.1 mm, an infill density of 100 %, and a printing speed of 20 mm/sec. The developed mathematical model from the regression analysis depicted the R-square value concerning the output responses like tensile strength will be 92.24, and dimensional area error will be 87.48. It proclaims that; the model is fit for the large-scale production of the hexagon lattice structure in the walnut shell/PLA composite. Furthermore, the macrographs of the tested composites fabricated at higher infill density exhibited lower sidewall edge failure than the samples fabricated at the lowest infill density percentages. © 2022 Institution of Structural Engineers","Biopolymer composite; Lattice structure; Optimization; PLA; Recycling; Walnut; Wood","","","","","","","","Hadi A., Vignat F., Villeneuve F., March.

Based on this understanding, a three-dimensional high-fidelity particle-scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for a sequential dual-laser powder bed fusion (SDL_PBF) process was developed in this paper. Using the model, the mechanism of improving the product quality of nickel-based superalloy GH4169 by dual laser sequential scanning strategies was particularly discussed. The effects of laser powers and offsets of sequential dual lasers on the molten pool wetting, pores, and necking were also specially studied, in which the process parameter window was determined through orthogonal experiments. The CFD simulations showed that, when the offsets of the sequential dual lasers are about 3.7 times of the laser radius, the wetting of the molten pool is the best in our test, because the molten pool flows around, resulting in a larger overlapping area. The SDL_PBF with a suitable rear laser source can eliminate the pores and the entrained air formed by the collapse of the recoil depression, which in turn is caused by the front laser. This is because the recoil depression generated by the rear laser can break down the pores caused by the incomplete melting of the front laser, so that the gas in the pores communicates with the air outside, and the liquid in the molten pool is replenished, thereby eliminating the pores and reducing the porosity of the product, which is consistent with the experimental results. In addition, the simulation results showed that the molten pool can flow stably and quickly due to the combined action of strong Marangoni force and steam recoil force as well as weak surface tension in the case of the SDL_PBF with appropriate process parameters, resulting in greatly improved surface quality. Therefore, this work can provide a way for improving multi-laser additive manufacturing of high-performance products. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Computational fluid dynamics; Necking; Orthogonal experiments; Sequential dual-laser powder bed fusion; Wetting","Additives; Nickel; Nickel alloys; Superalloys; Surface properties; Wetting; Laser powders; Manufactured products; Molten pool; Necking; Nickel-based superalloys; Orthogonal experiment; Particle scale; Powder bed; Process parameters; Sequential dual-laser powder bed fusion; Computational fluid dynamics","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11772204, 12062016)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 12062016 ; 11772204 ).

We use observations from video images captured under realistic LPBF processing conditions of nylon/alumina blends to propose a mechanistic model based on permeation. We then use the model to predict the operating conditions required to achieve particle bonding during indirect LPBF. The physical basis for the model is that particle bonding occurs when molten nylon binder permeates through the porous alumina shell that surrounds the nylon particles and forms solid bridges when the nylon solidifies. The model predictions are tested by building parts using a wide range of laser powers and scan speeds to determine experimentally if particle bonding has occurred. The results show that a permeation-based model is an accurate descriptor of binding mechanisms in indirect LPBF of mixed nylon/alumina powders. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Modeling; Permeation; Selective laser sintering","3D printers; Aluminum oxide; Laser heating; Polyamides; Rayon; Sintered alumina; Bonding mechanism; Ceramics particles; Laser powders; Mechanistic models; Model-based OPC; Modeling; Particle bondings; Powder bed; Processing condition; Video image; Sintering","","","","","ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company, EMRE","This project was funded by ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company, United States , through its membership in The University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute.

This method adopts multi node subsection control strategy. Under the real-time acquisition system of composite dual-vision sensors, through the on-line control of deposition layer size is realized by matching each piece with different process parameters of thin-walled parts. The thin-wall parts with controllable range of 5.5–10 mm and the heights controllable range of 6.5–13 mm. The results show that the multi-node piecewise strategy achieves a stable and convergent control. Compared to the conventional method, the material utilization increases by 51.4%.

Many mechanisms with different dimensions are investigated. The proposed design is a single-piece compliant mechanism. The number of flexible segments is a design parameter determined as a function of transferred torque. The mechanism can be produced by additive manufacturing from polylactic acid and polypropylene. It is possible to produce the proposed design as a single piece of polypropylene by additive manufacturing and injection molding methods; thus, it has the advantage of ease in manufacturing. The proposed design’s bending and torque transmission capacities are determined by applying analytical and numerical methods. Furthermore, a prototype was manufactured, and experiments were conducted. It is verified that the results of the experiments are consistent with theoretical approaches.

The feasibility in batch production as well as minimal material wastage establish the potential of MAM over other manufacturing methods. MAM of high strength-to-weight ratio alloys such as AlSi10Mg and Ti6Al4V is gaining popularity nowadays owing to their never ending demand in aerospace, automotive and biomedical industries. Both the alloys mark the two extreme ends of commercially available MAM alloys in terms of contrasting material properties. However, the poor surface integrity achieved by AlSi10Mg and Ti6Al4V parts/components after MAM demands post-processing via laser energy, chemicals, abrasives, conventional cutting tools etc. A recently developed low energy wire electrical discharge polishing (WEDP) method showed promising outcomes in MAM post-processing over aforementioned methods. In the present study, the performance and feasibility of WEDP in post-processing AlSi10Mg and Ti6Al4V are investigated with reference to the contrary properties associated with the alloys. The significant difference in melting point, thermal conductivity and chemical affinity led to distinct outcomes for the two alloys after WEDP. The enhancement in surface finish (Sa) was ~79% and ~91% for AlSi10Mg and Ti6Al4V respectively. The excellent corrosion resistance offered by the alloys is found to be unaltered in case of AlSi10Mg whereas enhanced for Ti6Al4V after WEDP. Modification in subsurface microhardness was observed upto 300 µm depth from polished surface for AlSi10Mg, whereas absent in Ti6Al4V. The study also revealed that the WEDP induced bigger craters in AlSi10Mg as well as cracks and resolidified layer in Ti6Al4V can be minimized at lower settings of pulse on time (TON). Moreover, EDS and XRD analysis indicated the formation of an oxide layer over Ti6Al4V surface after WEDP. © 2022 CIRP","Additive manufacturing; AlSi10Mg; Corrosion; Surface finish; Ti6Al4V","3D printers;

The mechanical properties and microstructure characterizations of ER321 stainless steel with and without UIT are investigated. It is found that grain structure of ER321 stainless steel is reduced to equiaxed dendrites (with UIT) from coarse columnar dendrites (without UIT). The UIT effectively refines grain sizes that decreases by ∼150% and homogenizes the grain structure of the deposition layers. Simultaneously, the UIT also facilitates the recrystallization that leads to the reduction of dislocation and texture densities. Furthermore, the improvement of grain structure enhances yield strength (∼10.5%), ultimate tensile strength (∼3.7%), microhardness (∼12.5%) and elongation of ER321 stainless steel. The grain boundary strengthening is the main strengthening mechanism, which leads to the yield strength increment of ER321 stainless steel under UIT condition. A way to effectively control grain structure in additive manufacturing-fabricated metal products using an UIT technique is provided in this work. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Austenitic stainless steel; Grain refinement; Mechanical properties; Ultrasonic impact treatment","Additives; Austenitic stainless steel; Grain boundaries; Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; Strengthening (metal); Tensile strength; Textures; Ultrasonic applications; Yield stress; Columnar dendrites; Deposition layers; Equiaxed dendrite; Grains refinement; Grainsize; Microstructure characterization; Properties and microstructures; Property characterizations; Recrystallisation; Ultrasonic impact treatment; 3D printers","","","","","Science Fund of Shandong Laboratory of Advanced Materials and Green Manufacturing, (AMGM2021F01); Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province, (ZD2019E006); Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2021YFC2801904); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (3072021CFT1012); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2021YFC2801904 ), Natural Science Fund of Heilongjiang Province (No. ZD2019E006 ), the Science Fund of Shandong Laboratory of Advanced Materials and Green Manufacturing (Yantai) (No. AMGM2021F01 ), and Fundamental Research funds for the Central Universities ( 3072021CFT1012 ).","DebRoy T., Mukherjee T., Wei H.L., Elmer J.W., Milewski J.O., Metallurgy, mechanistic models and machine learning in metal printing, Nat.

Although multiple holographic algorithms have recently made impressive progress, high-quality 3D holographic display using Fraunhofer diffraction, which is characterized by long-distance reconstruction and fast calculation, has not been adequately investigated. In this paper, a layer-based computer-generated holographic algorithm based on Fraunhofer diffraction with digital lens phase (DLP) and occlusion effect for improved 3D holographic display is proposed. In order to relocate the reconstructed image plane, a lens group composed of the DLP and a real converging lens is utilized. Both simulated and experimental results verify the feasibility of the method for reconstructing 3D scenes in high quality with long diffraction range and corrected 3D perception. This method is envisioned to find itself important applications in future holographic 3D schemes, such as holographic 3D display applying neural networks since Fraunhofer diffraction is the most computationally saving in all diffraction methods. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH","3D computer-generated holography; Fraunhofer diffraction; Occlusion effect","Computer generated holography; Holographic displays; Image reconstruction; Three dimensional computer graphics; Three dimensional displays; 3d computer-generated holography; 3D holographic displays; 3D scenes; Computer-generated holography; Fraunhofer diffraction; High quality; Holographic 3D display; Holographic algorithms; Key technologies; Occlusion effect; Diffraction","","","","","Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Education Department, (Y202148328); Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission, BMSTC, (Z201100004020012); Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission, BMSTC","Funding text 1: This work was partially supported by Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission (BMSTC) ( Z201100004020012 ) and Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Education Department ( Y202148328 ).; Funding text 2: The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Chang Wang, Zhenrong Zheng reports administrative support was provided by Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.

Laser irradiation on the sintered WC/Co composites generated two different microstructural regions. One is composed of WC and Co phases (WC/Co two-phase region), and the other includes W2C and W3Co3C phases (WC decomposition region). In the L-PBF-fabricated WC/Co composites, these two microstructural regions are distributed in a complex manner and their fractions varies depending on the laser parameters. Using a convolutional neural network model that is trained with the micrographs of single-laser-scanned WC/Co composites, the fractions of the two microstructural regions in the WC/Co composites fabricated by the L-PBF under various laser conditions were quantified. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that the laser power and spot size contribute more than the scan speed, which has been verified by numerical analysis based on the moving heat source model. A support vector machine (SVM) suggested that low laser power and low scan speed are required for suppressing the WC decomposition in the consolidated samples. The WC decomposition has been successfully suppressed in the samples fabricated under SVM-recommended conditions. © 2022 The Authors","Composite; Laser powder bed fusion; Machine learning; Moving heat source; Optimization","Carbides; Linear regression; Microstructure; Sintering; Support vector machines; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Laser power; Machine-learning; Micro-structural; Moving heat sources; Optimisations; Powder bed; Single lasers; WC-Co composite; Fabrication","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (22H05281)","The present work is supported by the Priority Research Project of Aichi Prefectural Government , \u201CKnowledge Hub Aichi\u201D and JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP22H05281 (Grant-in-Aid for Transformative Research areas).","Murr L.E., Gaytan S.M., Ramirez D.A., Martinez E., Hernandez J., Amato K.N., Shindo P.W., Medina F.R., Wicker R.B., Metal fabrication by additive manufacturing using laser and Electron beam melting technologies, J.

The LPBF-manufactured 316L stainless steel had a higher corrosion resistance in nitric acid solution than the Roll steel. According to the electrochemical studies, the impedance modulus (|Z|10mHz) of the LPBF alloy was twice as great as its roll counterpart after 1 day of immersion in nitric acid solution and about 1 kω cm2. Moreover, the potentiodynamic polarization test showed that the LPBF alloy had one-fourth the ipass value as the Roll sample, suggesting that the passive layer on the surface of additive manufactured samples is more stable and enriched with Cr2O3. Additionally, the LPBF microstructure did not contain harmful phases like TiN, which can adversely affect the protection performance of the passive layer.  © 2022 Author(s).","acid nitric solution; corrosion; laser powder bed fusion (LPBF); stainless steel","Austenitic stainless steel; Corrosion resistance; Corrosion resistant alloys; Fabrication; Microstructure; Steel corrosion; 316 L stainless steel; Acid nitric solution; Electrochemical behaviors; Electrochemical performance; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Microstructure performance; Nitric acid solutions; Passive layer; Powder bed; Nitric acid","","","","","Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, (SCU.EM1401.31395)","This research was financially supported by the Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz with Grant No. SCU.EM1401.31395.

Electrochemical polishing is one of the effective post-treatment methods to reduce the surface roughness. In this manuscript, polishing behavior of 316L stainless steel fabricated by LPBF in the eco-friendly NaNO3 solution was investigated. Different electrochemical tests including current efficiency, open circuit potential, and polarization behavior were carried out in this solution to investigate the influence of section orientation on the electrochemical polishing behavior. Test results indicated that electrochemical dissolution of the transverse section is more difficult than the longitudinal section because of the near-equiaxed dendrites and smaller grains diameter. The electrochemical polishing experiments showed that the polished surface presents hollowed-out retiform structure which is not conducive for the reduction of surface roughness value at low current density and the roughness value significantly decreases with the increase of total quantity of electricity at high current density. The weight loss of the transverse section is smaller than that of the longitudinal section at all current densities and electric charges, but the difference decreased with increasing current density. The electrochemical polishing at the current density of 40 A·cm−2 resulted in maximum reduction of the surface roughness with minimum weight loss. Finally, interior surfaces with longitudinal section and transverse section were polished successfully. The roughness values decreased from 17.3 and 18.3 μm to 2.4 and 2.6 μm, respectively. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","316L stainless steel; Electrochemical polishing; LPBF; Microstructure","Current density;

Therefore, improving the mechanical properties and reducing the anisotropy of Al alloys obtained by additive manufacturing is a topic of growing interest. This manuscript examines the effect of distinct heat treatments on the mechanical, anisotropic, and microstructural behavior of a hypoeutectic, almost eutectic, AlSi11Cu alloy obtained by laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF). The microstructural characterization revealed an Al matrix surrounded by a Si-rich network, forming a coral-like pattern with a heterogeneous combination of columnar and equiaxed grains. The texture indicated that the columnar grains were preferentially oriented towards the building direction with strong Cube and Goss components. Different strength-ductility ratios were obtained following the annealing and solution heat treatments at different temperatures (200 °C–550 °C) with a holding time of 1 h. In terms of grain size and dislocation density, no significant changes were found in the microstructure, suggesting that grain size and dislocation strengthening mechanisms are not highly affected by the heat treatments. In addition, the Si-enriched network remained interconnected until 300 °C. At higher temperatures, this interconnection was lost, giving rise to large Si particles depleting the Si content in solid solution in the Al matrix. Digital image correlation maps revealed that deformation fields were more homogeneous when the cellular structure disappeared. The visco-plastic self-consistent model showed that when applying the load at 30° in the building direction (BD), the largest tensile strength was generated, whereas the lowest strength was obtained when the load was parallel to the BD. Heat treatments for 1 h holding time were found to be efficient in reducing the Lankford coefficients dispersion, suggesting improvements in formability and reducing the alloy's planar anisotropy. These results revealed that annealing up to 400 °C or higher temperatures followed by water quenching leads to good strength and ductility ratios while reducing anisotropy. © 2022 The Authors","Al alloy; Heat treatment; Laser powder bed fusion; Microstructure; Plasticity; Texture","Aluminum alloys; Anisotropy; Ductility; Heat treatment; Image correlation; Plasticity; Tensile strength; Al-alloy; Columnar grain; Hypoeutectics; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; matrix; Mechanical; Micro-structural; Powder bed; Strength and ductilities; Textures","","","","","Instituto de Física Rosario in Rosario","The authors thank Professor Javier Walter Signorelli from the Instituto de Física Rosario in Rosario, Argentina, for his help using the VPSC model.","Podrouzek J., Marcon M., Nincevic K., Wan-Wendner R., Bio-inspired 3D infill patterns for additive manufacturing and structural applications, Materials, 12, (2019); Paolini A., Kollmannsberger S., Rank E., Additive manufacturing in construction: a review on processes, applications, and digital planning methods, Addit.

This paper presents a novel tube‑based MPC formulation based on system level disturbance reachable sets (SL‑DRS), which leverage the affine system level parameterization (SLP). We show that imposing a finite impulse response (FIR) constraint on the affine SLP guarantees containment of all future deviations in a finite sequence of SL‑DRS. This allows us to formulate a system level tube‑MPC (SLTMPC) method using the SL‑DRS as tubes, which enables concurrent optimization of the nominal trajectory and the tubes, while using a positively invariant terminal set. Finally, we show that the SL‑DRS tubes can also be computed offline. © 2022 The Authors","Reachable sets; Robust model predictive control; System level parameterization; Tube-based model predictive control","Concurrency control; Impulse response; Predictive control systems; Robust control; Tubes (components); Affine systems; Model-predictive control; Nominal trajectory; Predictive control methods; Reachable set; Robust model predictive control; System level parameterization; System levels; Tube-based model predictive control; Uncertainty; Model predictive control","","","","","Swiss Space Center; European Space Agency, ESA, (NPI 621-2018); Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich, ETH","Funding text 1: We would like to thank Carlo Alberto Pascucci from Embotech and Simon Muntwiler from ETH Zurich for the insightful discussions. ☆ This work was supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) under NPI 621-2018 and the Swiss Space Center (SSC).; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) under NPI 621-2018 and the Swiss Space Center (SSC).

Nevertheless, the low ductility and fracture toughness makes processing of TiAls extremely difficult. Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) can additively manufacture high-quality components of various materials. The micro layer-based nature of this process allows for design freedom and near-net shape products. The rapid cooling rates during the L-PBF process may cause defects during the manufacturing of hard materials such as TiAls. These rapid cooling rates lead to high induced residual stresses and crack formation. Several heating strategies and post-heat treatments methods are presented in the open literature for reducing the cracks formed during the L-PBF of TiAl. This study presents a new, novel scanning strategy for mitigating the cracks and reducing residual stresses in the L-PBF of Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb. This scanning strategy, referred to as sequential thermal scanning (STS) strategy, applies three thermal cycles in each layer: pre-heating selective area of the powder, melting a layer of powder, and post-heating the solidified layer. The laser process parameters used in each step of the STS strategy were determined and explained in this study. The thermal cycles applied in this scanning strategy were verified using an infra-red thermal camera. Sets of process parameters were studied in the melting step of the STS strategy using a factorial design of experiments. These sets of process parameters cover a large range of volumetric energy density (17–2917 J/mm3). The powder morphology, composition, and behavior were studied. The TiAl fabricated parts were investigated for bulk density, surface and internal cracks, balling defects, internal pores, and surface quality. The spatter formation was studied using a high speed camera. Process maps for the relationship between the laser process parameters and part defects were formulated. Residual stresses were measured to understand the influence of the STS strategy and its effects on the surface features and cracks. The results showed that the STS strategy could be used to produce parts of approximately 99 % density without internal pores. In addition, the STS strategy minimized the amount of internal micro-cracks in TiAl parts. This study contributes to the mitigation of internal defects in the L-PBF of TiAl using a sequential thermal scanning (STS) strategy. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Ductility; Fracture toughness;

However, with the raising awareness of environmental concerns and the growing interest in biomedical applications, the safety and water solubility of the existing photoinitiators are challenged. Herein, we developed a photoinitiating system based on a blue food colorant, i.e., indigo carmine. The indigo carmine-based photoinitiating system induced a rapid photochemical reaction and photobleaching under blue and green LEDs in the alkaline medium. The unprecedented photoinitiation ability of the indigo carmine-based photoinitiating system in terms of rate of photopolymerization and the final monomer conversion was achieved under the irradiation of low-intensity light sources. Subsequently, a sophisticated 3D printing in high fidelity was carried out and a 2D seashell was designed and printed with the function of 2D–3D reversible switching. These findings demonstrated that the indigo carmine-based photoinitiating system could resolve the safety and water solubility challenges and be involved in the 3D printing of biomedical materials. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Indigo carmine; Photobleaching; Photoinitiator; Photopolymerization","3D printers; Electrolytes; Light sources; Medical applications; Photopolymerization; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Base electrolytes; High-fidelity; Indigo Carmine; Neutral electrolytes; Photo polymerization; Photoinitiating systems; Photoinitiators; Water solubilities; Photobleaching","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (FT170100301, LE190100160)","The authors acknowledge funding from the Australian Research Council ( FT170100301 and LE190100160 ).

WAAM has the feature that large structures can be created in a shorter time and lower cost than conventional manufacturing techniques, but a method to guarantee the quality applicable for in-process is still not established. The laser ultrasonic technique should be a candidate for such a method since it can measure the quality of welded parts even during the welding process. In the presented work, the applicability of the laser ultrasonic through the measurements of artificial defects introduced to the simulated specimen for the deposited shape and actual WAAM deposits was evaluated. Although there were multi-surface wave reflections and low detection sensitivity of the surface in the top side measurement, the defect at 10-mm depth in the actual WAAM deposition was measurable with the surface polishing. In the bottom side measurement, even though the deposition part is narrow (5 mm or less) and tall (30 mm or less), the interfaces, including the defects, could be detected. © 2022, International Institute of Welding.","B-scope; Defect measurement; Laser ultrasonic; Non-contact; Synthesis aperture focusing technique; Wire arc additive manufacturing","Additives; Deposition; Surface waves; Ultrasonic testing; Welding; Wire; B-scope; Defect measurement; Focusing technique; Fundamental studies; Laser ultra-sonics; Laser-ultrasonic; Non-contact; Synthesis aperture focusing technique; Wire arc; Wire arc additive manufacturing; 3D printers","","","","","","","Knezovic N., Dolsak B., In-process non-destructive ultrasonic testing application during wire plus arc additive manufacturing, Adv Prod Eng & Manag, 13, 2, pp. 158-168, (2018); Lopez A., Bacelar R., Pires I., Santos T.G., Sousa J.P., Quintino L., Non-destructive testing application of radiography and ultrasound for wire and arc additive manufacturing, Addit Manuf, 21, pp. 298-306, (2018); Gobert C., Reutzel E.-W., Petrich J., Nassar A.-R., Phoha S., Application of supervised machine learning for defect detection during metallic powder bed fusion additive manufacturing using high resolution imaging, Addit Manuf, 21, pp. 517-528, (2018); Baumgartl H., Tomas J., Buettner R., Merkel M., A deep learning-based model for defect detection in laser-powder bed fusion using in-situ thermographic monitoring, Prog Addit Manuf, 5, pp. 277-285, (2020); Yang D., Wang G., Zhang G., Thermal analysis for single-pass multi-layer GMAW based additive manufacturing using infrared thermography, J Mater Process Technol, 244, pp. 215-224, (2017); Scruby C.B., Drain L.E., Laser ultrasonic, techniques and applications, (1990); Ochiai M., Butsuen T., Miura T., Et al., Sizing of micro cracks using laser-induced broad-band surface waves, J At Energy Soc Japan, 43, 3, pp. 275-281, (2001); Burrows S.E., Dutton B., Dixon S., Laser generation of lamb waves for defect detection: experimental methods and finite element modeling, IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control, 59, 1, pp. 82-89, (2012); Kinoshita M., Ebina M., Ohsawa M., Et al., Weld piece visualization by laser-ultrasonic technique, Trans Japan Soc Mech Eng, 78, 792, pp. 105-117, (2012); Yamamoto S., Hoshi T., Miura T., Et al., Defect detection in thick weld structure using welding in-process laser ultrasonic testing system, Mater Trans, 55, 7, pp. 998-1002, (2014); Cerniglia D., Montinaro N., Defect detection in additively manufactured components: laser ultrasound and laser thermography comparison, Procedia Struct Integrit, 8, pp. 154-162, (2018); Everton S., Dickens P., Tuck C., Et al., Using laser ultrasound to detect subsurface defects in metal laser powder bed fusion components, JOM, 70, 3, pp. 378-383, (2018); Millon C., Vanhoye A., Obaton A.-F., Penot J.-D., Development of laser ultrasonics inspection for online monitoring of additive manufacturing, Weld World, 62, pp. 653-661, (2018); Nomura K., Otaki S., Kita R., Asai S., In-situ detection of weld defect during the welding process by laser ultrasonic technique, Proc Meetings Acoust, 38, (2020); Otaki S., Matsuida T., Nomura K., Imura F., Kita R., Asai S., In-situ measurement of weld quality during MAG welding using laser ultrasonic, Q J Japan Welding Soc, 38, 1, pp. 11-18, (2020); Pouet B., Breugnot S., Clemenceau P., Robust laser-ultrasonic interferometer based on random quadrature demodulation, Rev Prog QNDE, 25, pp. 233-239, (2006); Muller W., Schmitz V., Schafer G., Reconstruction by the synthetic aperture focusing technique (SAFT), Nucl Eng Des, 94, 3, pp. 393-404, (1986); Javadi Y., MaxLeod C.N., Pierce S.G., Gachagan A., Lines D., Mineo C., Ding J., Williams S., Vasilev M., Mohseni E., Su R., Ultrasonic phased array inspection of a wire plus arc additive manufactured (WAAM) sample with intentionally embedded defects, Non-Destructive Test Cond Monit, 61, 3, pp. 144-148, (2019)","K.

Several finite-element (FE)-based design strategies have been developed to produce network materials with prescribed mechanical properties. However, obtaining network designs with a prescribed negative Poisson's ratio over large strain remains a challenge. Here, an optimization framework was developed using isogeometric analysis and a genetic algorithm for the design of soft missing rib structures with controllable negative Poisson's ratios over large strains. The missing rib structures with six ligaments were optimized to achieve constant negative Poisson's ratios ranging from -0.1 to -0.6 up to 70% tensile strain under plane stress condition. The optimization framework was employed to obtain a missing rib network design with deformation behavior closely matching that of cat's skin up to 90% tensile strain. This optimized design was fabricated using a biocompatible material via liquid additive manufacturing and validated experimentally, demonstrating the potential of the soft missing rib designs for biomedical applications.  © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","","Biocompatibility; Genetic algorithms; Medical applications; Poisson ratio; Tensile strain; Tissue engineering; Biomedical devices; Design optimization; Large strains; Negative Poisson ratio; Network design; Network materials; Optimization framework; Rib structure; Soft network; Tissues engineerings; Biomimetics","","","","","","","Abdeljaber O., Avci O., Inman D.J., Optimization of chiral lattice based metastructures for broadband vibration suppression using genetic algorithms, J.

The essential novelty of this study is that we show that the connectivity constraint can be realized by imposing the void-phase self-supporting constraint. The corresponding proof is given in Appendix. The Elements Scheme (ES) method is used to construct the element-wise self-supporting constraint. By improving the constraint aggregating functions and aggregating a large number of element-wise self-supporting constraints on solid-phase and void-phase structures into three constraints, we propose a concise topology optimization formulation to effectively and simultaneously suppress the small overhang angle boundaries, hanging features (solid-phase upside-down triangles), voids with pointed tips (void-phase upside triangles), slim components, small voids, and enclosed voids in the optimized design. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of this formulation in comparison with other connectivity control methods. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Additive manufacturing; Connectivity constraint; Design for manufacturability; Self-supporting constraint; Topology optimization","Additives; Design for manufacturability; Machine design; Numerical methods; Shape optimization; Structural optimization; Topology; Connectivity constraints; Design-for-manufacturability; Length constraints; Manufacturing constraint; Self-supporting constraint; Solid phasis; Solid-phase; Structural topology optimization; Topology optimisation; Two phase; 3D printers","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52075070, U1906233)","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant number 52075070, U1906233].

The quality and printing process of the fabricated composite part greatly affects its mechanical properties and performance. In this study, the effect of printing parameters (extrusion temperature, extrusion width and extrusion multiplier) on the tensile and flexural properties were examined. To improve the quality of the 3D printed composite specimen, a controlled cooling effect was introduced. The quality of the printing of the composite specimen was studied and inspected with the ranges of air flow rates. The results highlighted that using extrusion temperature of 230OC, extrusion width 1.2 mm and extrusion multiplier of 0.7 showed the best mechanical performance. While the quality of the composite specimen printed using the cooling with the air flow rate of 40 l/min revealed the finest distribution of 3D printed composite lines and layers. The CCF composite structure fabricated using the combination of optimum printing parameters exhibited the maximum tensile and flexural strength levels of 294.46 MPa and 247.24 MPa, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Controlled cooling effect; Mechanical properties; Printing process parameters","","","","","","Lietuvos Mokslo Taryba","This research was funded by a grant (No. S-M-ERA.NET-20-1) (project: “Additive Manufactured Composite Smart Structures with Embedded Fibre Bragg Grating Sensors”, acronym: “AMCSS”) from the Research Council of Lithuania.","Yakout M., Elbestawi M.A., Additive manufacturing of composite materials: an overview, 6th International Conference on Virtual Machining Process Technology (VMPT), pp. 1-8, (2017); Parandoush P., Lin D., A review on additive manufacturing of polymer-fiber composites, Compos.

The current work addresses the limitations of the existing slicing software in producing parts with customized filament layouts. A new filament deposition algorithm that produces filament paths taking as input arbitrary point-wise orientation fields is presented. Like slicing software, it can control various process parameters, including extrusion width, layer height, filament spacing, number of layers, printing and travel speeds, and produces G-Code instructions. Capabilities of the algorithm are presented by producing parts with both partial and maximum infill and parts with a multi-oriented layer stacking sequence. The results show that the algorithm can print parts with filaments oriented along the input orientation field at different infills, thus making this contribution a potential tool for many applications that demand customized filament placement. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Curvilinear paths; Material extrusion; Orientation fields; Slicing","'current; Additive manufacturing process; Arbitrary points; Curvilinear path; Filament paths; Freeforms; Material extrusion; Orientation fields; Point wise; Slicing; Extrusion","","","","","Italian Minister of University and Research, (2017L7X3CS); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Horizon 2020, (764636); Horizon 2020; Regione Lombardia, (3776/2020); Regione Lombardia","Funding text 1: This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska Curie grant Agreement No 764636 . ; Funding text 2: This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska Curie grant Agreement No 764636.

Taking the typical refractory composite of tungsten-copper as an instance, the feedstock for printing was made of 97 wt% W-Cu composite powders and 3 wt% binder. The resulted W-Cu composite was printed on a desktop 3D printer at room temperature, followed by designated degreasing and hydrogen-reduction sintering. Characteristics including phase constituents, microstructure, mechanical and electrical properties of the resulted composite have been identified. The revealed neat and intact interfaces between the constituent Cu and W after fully degreasing ensured sufficient loading transfer and deformation coordination, contributing to excellent mechanical properties with high electrical conductivity. This work extended the feasibility of fabricating refractory alloys without molds and expensive equipment, providing a new solution and scheme for refractory materials with intricate structures. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3-D printing; Electron microscopy; Metal-matrix composites (MMCs); Microstructures","3D printers; Binary alloys; Copper alloys; Costs; Metallic matrix composites; Refractory metals; Sintering; Temperature; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; De-greasing; Low-costs; Lows-temperatures; Matrix composite; Metal matrix; Metal-matrix composite; Refractory composites; W-Cu composites; Microstructure","","","","","Innovation Capability Support Program of Shaanxi, (2019KJXX-052); Xi'an Advanced Manufacturing Technology Project, (21XJZZ0048); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51604223)","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of National Natural Science Foundation of China (51604223), Innovation Capability Support Program of Shaanxi (2019KJXX-052) and Xi'an Advanced Manufacturing Technology Project (21XJZZ0048).

AI techniques are known to be superior for prediction; they are accurate and fast compared to finite difference, finite element, and finite volume methods. To obtain the data needed for the AI prediction, the finite difference method is used to solve the dimensionless Reynolds equation at various aspect ratios. The bearing performance characteristics, such as load-carrying capacity, attitude angle, friction variable, and maximum-film-pressure ratio, are determined considering isothermal conditions. Four aspect ratios are considered from 0.25 to 4, with eccentricity ratios varying between 0.2 and 0.8. Three artificial neural networks (Feed-forward, Radial basis, and Generalized regression networks) and fuzzy logic techniques were applied to the obtained data from FDM simulation to predict the performance parameters. The three trained neural networks and the fuzzy system were tested to obtain the performance characteristics for aspect ratios and eccentricity ratios that were not included in the FDM study. The current response of the trained ANN models and the fuzzy logic technique is found to be very fast and precise, with a prediction computational time of less than one second and an error of less than 2.5 percent. © 2022","Artificial intelligence; Fuzzy logic technique; Lubrication; Neural network; Plain journal bearing","Computer circuits; Finite difference method; Finite volume method; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Journal bearings; Artificial intelligence techniques; Aspect-ratio; Bearing performance; Eccentricity ratios; Fuzzy logic techniques; Lubrication /; Neural-networks; Performance characteristics; Plain journal bearings; Aspect ratio","","","","","","","Nuruzzaman D.M., Khalil M.K., Chowdhury M.A., Rahaman M.L., Study on pressure distribution and load capacity of a journal bearing using finite element method and analytical method, Int.

A crucial step to consolidate 3D-printed ceramic parts is “sintering”, a time and energy (temperature) intensive densification process. Here we present a strategy for rapid sintering (∼ 300–450 °C/min) of lithography-based additively manufactured alumina ceramics enabling consolidation of ceramic components of complex shapes within minutes. Highly dense, fine-grained microstructures were achieved by controlling densification and limiting grain growth through rapid radiation heat transfer. The high mechanical strength and toughness measured in additively manufactured alumina (∼ 810 MPa and ∼ 4.3 MPa m1/2) sintered at 1600 °C within 2 min was superior to that of conventionally sintered reference parts. This study opens the path for rapid sintering of complex shaped ceramic architectures of high density with tailored microstructure and properties. © 2022 The Authors","Ceramics; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Sintering; Stereolithography","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum oxide; Grain growth; Heat transfer; Lithography; Microstructure; Additive manufacturing technology; Ceramic; Ceramic component; Engineering applications; Geometrical accuracy; Geometrical complexity; High-strength; Multi materials; Rapid sintering; Technical ceramics; Sintering","","","","","Department of Materials Science; Lithoz GmbH; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (817615); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; European Research Council, ERC; Javna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS, ARRS, (5110–1/2019–50, P2–0087); Javna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS, ARRS","Funding text 1: The funding for this research was provided by the European Research Council (ERC) excellent science grant “CERATEXT” through Horizon 2020 program under contract 817615 .

Microstructural observations and phase analyses indicate formation of columnar β grains with acicular α/α′ phases in as-built condition. The roughness of the as-fabricated samples is significant with an average roughness of Ra = 15.71 ± 3.96 µm and a root mean square roughness of Rrms = 108.4 ± 24.9 µm, however, both values are reduced to Ra = 0.19 ± 0.04 µm and Rrms = 4.9 ± 0.6 µm after mechanical grinding. Mechanical tests are carried out on as-fabricated specimens followed by stress relief treatment. All samples are tested to failure in fatigue, under fully-reversed tension-compression conditions of R = −1. The as-built samples failed from the surface with crack initiation mainly at micro-notches, whereas after mechanically grinding, crack initiation changed to subsurface defects such as pores. Minimizing surface roughness by mechanically grinding eliminates surface micro-notches which improves fatigue strength in the high cycle fatigue region. Fatigue notch factor calculations showed that the effect of surface roughness was significantly lower when HDH powder is used compared to standard spherical powder. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed an in-plane compressive stress, micro-strain and grain refinement on the surface of the mechanically ground samples. Fractography observations (macroscale) revealed a fully brittle fracture in the first stage of crack growth with a transition to a dominantly ductile fracture in the third stage of crack growth. On the other hand, at the micro scale, even the brittle fracture regions showed evidence of ductile fracture within the α′ martensite laths. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Fractography; Micro-computed tomography; Non-spherical powder; Surface roughness","3D printers; Aluminum alloys; Computerized tomography; Crack initiation; Ductile fracture; Grain refinement; High-cycle fatigue; Hydrides; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Stress relief; Titanium alloys; X ray powder diffraction; Condition; Cracks initiations; Fatigue performance; Laser powders; Micro-computed tomography; Non-Spherical; Non-spherical powder; Particles-size distributions; Powder bed; Spherical powders; Surface roughness","","","","","Abhilash Dinkar; Illinois Institute of Technology at Chicago; Krishna Sai Vishnumolakala; Materials and Aerospace Engineering Department; Pennsylvania Infrastructure Technology Alliance; National Science Foundation, NSF, (DMR-2050916); National Science Foundation, NSF; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development, DCED; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, LLNL, (DE-AC52–07NA27344, LLNL-JRNL-836489); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, LLNL; Carnegie Mellon University, CMU; Lehigh University","Funding text 1: AM acknowledges startup funding from Mechanical, Materials and Aerospace Engineering Department at Illinois Institute of Technology at Chicago , Illinois.

The differences in microstructure and mechanical properties of the upper, middle, and lower parts of the high-entropy alloy were systematically studied. The results show that the sample contains FCC phase and BCC phase. With the increase of distance from substrate, the heat gradually accumulates, and apart of FCC (face centered cubic) is transformed into BCC (body centered cubic) in Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Ni high-entropy alloy. The increase of BCC improves the microhardness (from 281.86HV to 310.38HV), yield strength (from 514 MPa to 656 MPa) and ultimate tensile strength (from 916 MPa to 1087 MPa). © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Combined cable wire; High entropy alloy; Mechanical properties; Microstructure","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Cables; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Entropy; High-entropy alloys; Iron alloys; Nickel alloys; Tensile strength; Aluminum welding; Body-centred cubic; Cable wires; Combined cable wire; Cr-Fe-Ni; Face-centered cubic phasis; High entropy alloys; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Welding wires; Wire arc; Microstructure","","","","","Sino-Russian Cooperation Fund of Harbin Engineering University; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51975419); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2022A1515010761); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province","This project is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51975419), also partially supported by Sino-Russian Cooperation Fund of Harbin Engineering University, Basic and Applied Basic Research Fund of Guangdong Province (No.2022A1515010761).","Chen S., Li Q., Zhong J., Xing F., pp. 255-264, (2019); Chen S., Tong Y., Liaw P.K., Additive manufacturing of high-entropy alloys: a review, Entropy, 20, 12, (2018); Shen Q., Kong X., Chen X., Fabrication of bulk Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Ni high-entropy alloy using combined cable wire arc additive manufacturing (CCW-AAM): Microstructure and mechanical properties, J.

The target material symmetry plays also an important role in additive manufacturing. In numerous applications it would be useful to obtain effectively isotropic materials. While these typically emerge from a random microstructure, it is not obvious how to achieve isotropy with a periodic order. We prove that arrangements of inclusions based on a rhomboidal cell that generates the face-centered cubic lattice do in fact preserve any material symmetry of the constituents, so that spherical inclusions of isotropic materials in an isotropic matrix produce effectively isotropic composites. © 2022 The Authors","Homogenization; Isotropic metamaterial; Material symmetry; Periodic composite","Composites material; Design and analysis; Homogenization; Isotropic materials; Isotropic metamaterial; Isotropics; Material symmetry; Material-based; Periodic composites; Sub-units; Metamaterials","","","","","Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica ""Francesco Severi"", INdAM; Gruppo Nazionale per la Fisica Matematica, GNFM; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/S030875/1, EP/T017899/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; national Italian mathematics association INdAM","RP is partially supported by EPSRC, United Kingdom research grants EP/S030875/1 and EP/T017899/1 and conducted the research according to the inspiring scientific principles of the national Italian mathematics association INdAM (“Istituto nazionale di Alta Matematica”).

Considering the experimental studies for this mixture, which does not have a definite formulation, the success of the resulting products shows the rheological properties that enable the material to be built. Data on the constructability of the material can be obtained by defining the volume ratios of the resulting samples with the Fuzzy Logic method. For the constructability of the material, a Mamdani type fuzzy model was created and the “CENTROID center of gravity” method was stipulated as the clarification method. While the component material ratios of the cementitious mixture create the fuzzy inputs of the system, static and dynamic yield stresses are reached as fuzzy output values. 15 rules obtained from experimental studies that enable the system to work were defined and then the operation of the method was tested. In this study, it is aimed to develop a decision mechanism for intermediate values that are not encountered in the experimental results by blurring the mixture models supported with definite findings. © 2022, Istanbul Teknik Universitesi, Faculty of Architecture.

Due to its high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), the system's performance is severely degraded. This paper proposes a hybrid Maximal-Minimum approach with decomposed selective mapping to minimize PAPR constraints for 5 G UFMC systems. The complex signal is decomposed into real and imaginary branches, allowing the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) operation. In each branch, different phase vectors are mixed with real and imaginary terms. The FIR response is based on individually optimized PAPR values, which are then copied for transmission. Simulations showed that the proposed method reduced PAPR by optimizing the weighting factor within the Out of Band (OoB) range. It is superior in Bit Error rate (BER)-wise, reduction as compared with selective mapping (SLM) and decomposed-UFMC-SLM. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH","High PAPR; M-ary encoding QAM; Maximal-Minimum approach with decomposed SLM; Optimum weighting factor","5G mobile communication systems; Bit error rate; Fast Fourier transforms; Frequency allocation; Inverse problems; Mapping; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Quadrature amplitude modulation; Signal encoding; Spectrum efficiency; Encodings; High peak-to-average power ratio; M-ary encoding QAM; Maximal-minimum approach with decomposed selective mapping; Minimum approach; Optimum weighting factor; Optimum-weighting; Peakto-average power ratios (PAPR); Selective mapping; Weighting factors; Peak to average power ratio","","","","","","","Tao Y., Liu L., Liu S., Zhang Z., A survey: several technologies of non-orthogonal transmission for 5G, China Commun., 12, pp. 1-15, (2015); Rani P.N., Rani C.S., UFMC: the 5G modulation technique, pp. 1-3; Akyildiz I.F., Nie S., Lin S.-C., Chandrasekaran M., 5G roadmap: 10 key enabling technologies, Comput.

Such functionality has tremendous potential covering a broad spectrum of applications, mainly replacing divers performing hazardous jobs. Soft robotics provides an efficient solution for operating in these scenarios and adapting to uncertain environmental conditions. This paper presents the design and fabrication of a simple, low-cost, and easily deployable soft gripper for underwater manipulation. We use modelling and simulation techniques for designing the soft fluidic elastomer actuators that compose the soft gripper and additive manufacturing techniques for rapid test cycles and validation. These techniques allow for a fast redesign depending on the application requirements. The proposal combines materials and fabrication techniques to take advantage of their strengths. We validate the feasibility and ability of the proposed soft gripper in a challenging underwater scenario using a subaquatic vehicle. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; Remote Operated Vehicles (ROVs); soft gripper; underwater grasping","","","","","","","","Mura D., Barbarossa M., Dinuzzi G., Grioli G., Caiti A., Catalano M.G., A Soft Modular End Effector for Underwater Manipulation: A Gentle, Adaptable Grasp for the Ocean Depths, IEEE Robot.

Such high heat flux induces a high temperature environment and consequent high thermal stress, yet there is no dedicated cooling for the probe structure. A new DLP (Divertor Langmuir probe) design which is called “full-tungsten design” has been proposed for this harsh environment. Alumina is used as the electrical insulating material, which is a kind of brittle material and very easy to generate crack, especially when considering its strength would be decreased due to the elevated temperature. To assess compliance with the heat loads, the probe and environment are simulated using software ANSYS by finite element method. The full-tungsten DLP structure shows good thermal and mechanical behaviors under the specified cyclic thermal loads. Transient thermal analysis combined with elasto-plastic analysis has been performed, the thermal analysis result shows the materials temperature is acceptable. Damages due to progressive deformation as well as time-independent fatigue have been assessed according to the structural design criteria SDC-IC (The Structural Design Criteria for ITER In-vessel Components). Damage on alumina layer due to fast fracture has also been assessed based on the maximum tensile stress theory. The analysis results show the design is quite promising. © 2022","Finite element method; Full-tungsten design; ITER Langmuir probe","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Damage detection; Heat flux; Structural design; Thermal load; Thermoanalysis; Tokamak devices; Tungsten; Design criteria; Divertor Langmuir probe; Engineering design; Full-tungsten design; High heat flux; High thermal; High-temperature environment; International thermonuclear experimental reactor; International thermonuclear experimental reactor langmuir probe; Probe structures; Finite element method","","","","","Innovation Research of SWIP, (202101XWCXRZ002, 202103XWCXRZ003); Instituto Tecnológico y de Energías Renovables, ITER, (P1.CN.05); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11905045, 11975092); National Magnetic Confinement Fusion Program of China, (2018YFE0312100)","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank the members of the ITER Organization and China Domestic Agency for the useful discussions and support of this work.

This leads to a higher defect density in the final parts, commonly related to melt pool instabilities in the transition and keyhole melting modes. In this work, processing diagrams, temperature prediction models, X-ray computed tomography (XCT), and metallography are used for establishing criteria in process parameter optimization of high reflectivity aluminium alloys based on AlSi10Mg response in using 57 different power, velocity, and beam diameter combinations. For LPBF systems with focused beam diameters <100 μm, divergent beams obtained by defocusing to a position above the LPBF build plate primarily lead to conduction mode melt pools, avoiding keyhole mode defects, and resulting in parts with densities >99.98%, with effectively no porous defects in the subsurface regions. Additionally, an analytical model guided selection of laser power and velocity settings for a focused beam help in stabilizing melt pool and spatter dynamics in the transition melting mode thereby enabling a potential to obtain density values close to conduction mode densities (∼99.98%). A dimensionless keyhole number (Ke) was used in this work to identify distinct regions of conduction (Ke of 0–12), transition (Ke of 12–20), and keyhole (Ke > 20) mode melting during LPBF of AlSi10Mg. Lastly, a melt pool aspect ratio (ratio of melt pool depth to width) of ∼0.4 is observed to be the threshold between conduction and transition/keyhole mode melt pools for AlSi10Mg, different from the conventionally assumed 0.5. This work demonstrates a dimensionless-process map method to obtain near fully dense parts that can be generalized for LPBF of high reflectivity alloys. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; AlSi10Mg; Aluminium alloys; Dimensionless process maps; Laser powder bed fusion; Porosity","Aluminum alloys; Aspect ratio; Computerized tomography; Defects; Lakes; Melting; Selective laser melting; Thermal conductivity; Titanium alloys; Beam diameters; Conduction mode; Dimensionless process map; Focused beams; High reflectivity; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Melt pool; Powder bed; Process maps; Reflection","","","","","Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario, (081885); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (RGPIN-2018-05731); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201906020162); China Scholarship Council, CSC","Sagar Patel and Mihaela Vlasea appreciate the funding support received from Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario grant number 081885) .

However, current methods often perform poorly in challenging scenes, such as incorrect initial pose, sudden re-orientation, and severe occlusion. In contrast, we present a robust 6D object pose tracking method with a novel hierarchical feature fusion network, refer it as HFF6D, which aims to predict the object's relative pose between adjacent frames. Instead of extracting features from adjacent frames separately, HFF6D establishes sufficient spatial-temporal information interaction between adjacent frames. In addition, we propose a novel subtraction feature fusion (SFF) module with attention mechanism to leverage feature subtraction during feature fusion. It explicitly highlights the feature differences between adjacent frames, thus improving the robustness of relative pose estimation in challenging scenes. Besides, we leverage data augmentation technology to make HFF6D be used more effectively in the real world by training only with synthetic data, thereby reducing manual effort in data annotation. We evaluate HFF6D on the well-known YCB-Video and YCBInEOAT datasets. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that HFF6D outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, it is also proved to achieve high-robustness tracking under the above-mentioned challenging scenes.  © 1991-2012 IEEE.","6D object pose tracking; challenging scenes; feature subtraction; hierarchical feature fusion","Gesture recognition; Three dimensional computer graphics; Tracking (position); Video recording; 6d object pose tracking; Challenging scene; Feature subtraction; Features extraction; Features fusions; Hierarchical feature fusion; Hierarchical features; Object pose; Pose tracking; Pose-estimation; Robustness; Solid modelling; Three-dimensional display; Video sequences; Three dimensional displays","","","","","","","Drost B., Ulrich M., Navab N., Ilic S., Model globally, match locally: Efficient and robust 3D object recognition, Proc.

In this paper, the mechanical responses of additively manufactured samples using vat polymerization process with different weight ratios of magnetic microparticles were used to develop, train, and validate a neural network model. Samples with six different compositions, ranging from neat photopolymer to a composite of photopolymer with 4 wt.% of magnetic particles, were manufactured and mechanically tested at quasi-static strain rate and ambient environmental conditions. The experimental data were also synthesized using a data-driven approach based on shape-preserving piecewise interpolations while leveraging the concept of simple micromechanics rule of mixture. The overarching objective is to forecast the mechanical behavior of new compositions to eliminate or reduce the need for exhaustive post-manufacturing testing, resulting in an accelerated product development cycle. The ML model predictions were found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental data for prognostication of the mechanical behavior of physically tested samples with near-unity correlation coefficients. Furthermore, the ML model performed reasonably well in predicting the mechanical response of untested, newly formulated compositions of photopolymers and magnetic particles. On the other hand, the data-driven approach predictions suffered from processing artifacts, demonstrating the superiority of ML algorithms in handling this type of data. Overall, this analysis approach holds great potential in advancing the prospects of additive manufacturing and model-less mechanics of material analyses. A byproduct of the ML approach is using the results for quality assurance, accelerating the acceptance of additively manufactured parts into industrial deployments. © 2022 The Authors","Data driven; Machine learning; Magnetoelectric composites; Particulate composites; Vat polymerization","3D printers; Additives; Data Analytics; Forecasting; Machine learning; Quality assurance; Strain rate; Data driven; Data-driven approach; Machine data; Machine-learning; Magnetic particle; Magnetoelectric composites; Mechanical behavior; Mechanical response; Particulate composites; Vat polymerization; Polymerization","","","","","U.S. Department of Defense, DOD, (W911NF1410039, W911NF1810477); U.S. Department of Defense, DOD; San Diego State University, SDSU","Funding text 1: The research leading to these results was supported in part by the United States Department of Defense under Grant Agreement Nos.

However, due to the complicated processes used to fabricate microfluidic channels, most picoliter (pL) droplet generation methods are limited to research in laboratories with cleanroom facilities and complex instrumentation. The purpose of this work is to investigate a method that uses 3D printing to fabricate microfluidic devices that can generate droplets with sizes <100 pL and encapsulate single dense beads mechanistically. Our device generated monodisperse droplets as small as ~48 pL and we demonstrated the usefulness of this droplet generation technique in biomolecule analysis by detecting Lactobacillus acidophillus 16s rRNA via digital loop-mediated isothermal amplification (dLAMP). We also designed a mixer that can be integrated into a syringe to overcome dense bead sedimentation and found that the bead-in-droplet (BiD) emulsions created from our device had <2% of the droplets populated with more than 1 bead. This study will enable researchers to create devices that generate pL-scale droplets and encapsulate dense beads with inexpensive and simple instrumentation (3D printer and syringe pump). The rapid prototyping and integration ability of this module with other components or processes can accelerate the development of point-of-care microfluidic devices that use droplet-bead emulsions to analyze biological or chemical samples with high throughput and precision. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing; bead encapsulation; microfluidics; picoliter droplets; rapid prototyping","3D printers; Biomolecules; Chemical analysis; Drops; Fabrication; Fluidic devices; Ostwald ripening; Rapid prototyping; RNA; Syringes; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Bead encapsulation; Droplet generation; Drug discovery; Microfluidics devices; Picoliter droplets; Picoliters; Rapid-prototyping; Single cells analysis; Microfluidics","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (K01EB027718); National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, NIBIB","Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute Of Biomedical Imaging And Bioengineering of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number K01EB027718.

Numerical simulations and cladding experiments were combined in the work to explore the influence mechanism of nozzles’ working heights and deflection angles on Ni35A powder flow and powder concentration distribution on inclined substrates. Powder concentration on inclined substrates first increased and then decreased with the increased working height during the vertical cladding of nozzles, which was consistent with the experimental law. As deflection angles of nozzles increased, the coaxiality of powder flow with nozzles decreased, and powder concentration on inclined substrates decreased significantly. The cladding method of deflecting nozzles should be avoided when the parts to be repaired do not interfere with nozzles. © 2022","CFD numerical simulations; Coaxial powder feeding; Discrete-phase model; Inclined-plane matrix; Powder convergence characteristics","Computational fluid dynamics; Industrial research; Laser cladding; Nozzles; Numerical models; CFD numerical simulations; Coaxial powder feeding; Convergence characteristics; Deflection angles; Discrete phase modeling; Inclined planes; Inclined-plane matrix; matrix; Powder convergence characteristic; Powder feeding; Substrates","","","","","Program for Innovative Research Team in Science and Technology in Fujian Province University , Fujian, China; Program for Innovative Research Team in Science and Technology in Fujian Province University, Fujian, China","Funding text 1: The work was supported by Program for Innovative Research Team in Science and Technology in Fujian Province University, Fujian, China.; Funding text 2: The work was supported by Program for Innovative Research Team in Science and Technology in Fujian Province University , Fujian, China.","Yuan W., Li R., Chen Z., Et al., A comparative study on microstructure and properties of traditional laser cladding and high-speed laser cladding of Ni45 alloy coatings, Surf.

The thermal performance of the filament is investigated through test printing, thermal conductivity testing and scanning electron microscope imaging. Topology optimisation is used to generate novel heat sink designs for passive cooling through natural convection. The optimised designs are complex and are printed using soluble support materials. The measured anisotropic thermal conductivity of the layer-by-layer additively manufactured specimens is included in the topology optimisation process to design heat sinks specifically with the chosen filament and process in mind. It is shown that when taking the material anisotropy into account, the topology-optimised heat sinks deliver up to 10–20% reduction in thermal resistance compared to a reference straight-fin design. © 2022 The Author(s)","Heat sink; Material extrusion; Thermal conduction; Topology optimisation","3D printers; Additives; Anisotropy; Heat resistance; Heat sinks; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermal conductivity; Topology; Experimental testing; Heat sink design; Manufacturing testing; Material extrusion; Microscope imaging; Passive cooling; Scanning electrons; Thermal conduction; Thermal Performance; Topology optimisation; Extrusion","","","","","","","Ahn C.-H., Oh J., Resistive grounding technique of heat sink for reducing radiation noise, J.

The development of Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies has boosted design freedom, leading to a wide range of geometries and integrating functionally-graded lattice structures. This paper presents three AM-oriented numerical optimization methods, aimed at optimizing components made of: i) bulk material, ii) a combination of bulk material and graded lattice structures; iii) an integration of solid, lattice and thin-walled structures. The optimization methods were validated by considering the steering column support of a mid-rear engine sports car, involving complex loading conditions and shape. The results of the three methods are compared, and the advantages and disadvantages of the solutions are discussed. The integration between solid, lattice thin-walled structures produced the best results, with a mass reduction of 49.7% with respect to the existing component. © IMechE 2020.","additive manufacturing; Cross car beam; dash; finite element; lattice structures; modal and equivalent static stiffness; steering column; topology optimization","3D printers; Accident prevention; Additives; Automobile steering equipment; Automotive industry; Extrusion; Finite element method; Materials handling equipment; Numerical methods; Structural optimization; Thin walled structures; Topology; Bulk materials; Cross car beam; Dash; Finite element; Lattice structures; Modal and equivalent static stiffness; Optimization method; Static stiffness; Steering column; Topology optimisation; Shape optimization","","","","","","","Barbieri S.G., Giacopini M., Mangeruga V., Et al., A design strategy based on topology optimization techniques for an additive manufactured high performance engine piston, Procedia Manuf, 11, pp. 641-649, (2017); Orquera M., Campocasso S., Millet D., Some principles to optimise an additively manufactured multi-component product, Journal of Engineering Design, 31, 4, pp. 219-240, (2020); Kong B.S., Park D.K., Design optimization of the cowl cross bar – light cowl cross bar satisfying 5 performances, Int J Automot Technol, 19, pp. 387-391, (2018); Cao T.B., Kedziora S., Sellen S., Et al., Optimization assisted redesigning a structure of a hydrogen valve: the redesign process and numerical evaluations, Int J Interact Des Manuf, 14, pp. 613-629, (2020); Manios S.E., Lagaros N.D., Nassiopoulos E., Nested topology optimization methodology for designing two-wheel chassis, Front Built Environ, 5, (2019); Cavazzuti M., Baldini A., Bertocchi E., Et al., High performance automotive chassis design: a topology optimization based approach, Struct Multidisc Optim, 44, pp. 45-56, (2011); Mantovani S., Lo Presti I., Cavazzoni L., Et al., Influence of manufacturing constraints on the topology optimization of an automotive dashboard, Procedia Manuf, 11, pp. 1700-1708, (2017); Zuo K.T., Chen L.P., Zhang Y.Q., Et al., Manufacturing- and machining-based topology optimization, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 27, pp. 531-536, (2006); Vatanabe S.L., Lippi T.N., De Lima C.R., Et al., Topology optimization with manufacturing constraints: a unified projection-based approach, Adv Eng Softw, 100, pp. 97-112, (2016); Harzheim L., Graf G., A review of optimization of cast parts using topology optimization, Struct Multidisc Optim, 30, pp. 491-497, (2005); Harzheim L., Graf G., A review of optimization of cast parts using topology optimization, Struct Multidisc Optim, 31, pp. 388-399, (2006); Junk S., Klerch B., Nasdala L., Et al., Topology optimization for AM using a component of a humanoid robot, Procedia CIRP, 70, pp. 102-107, (2018); Abdi M., Ashcroft I., Wildman R.D., Design optimisation for an additively manufactured automotive component, IJPT, 7, pp. 142-161, (2018); Silva F.J.G., Campilho R.D.S.G., Gouveia R.M., Et al., A novel approach to optimize the design of parts for additive manufacturing, Procedia Manuf, 17, pp. 53-61, (2018); Plocher J., Panesar A., Review on design and structural optimisation in additive manufacturing: towards next-generation lightweight structures, Mater Design, 183, (2019); Brackett D., Ashcroft I., Hague R.; Patterson A.E., Lee Y.H., Allison J.T., Overview of the Development and Enforcement of Process-Driven Manufacturability Constraints in Product Design, In: Proceedings of the ASME 2019 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference.

For the meshing of arbitrary geometry, an open-source 3D mesh generator, GMSH, is utilized in this work. Here, a linear four-noded tetrahedral element is utilized due to its advantage in mesh generation. A MATLAB program is composed of three procedures. The pre-processing aims to import mesh and input files into MATLAB workspace. In the main processing, node-based topology optimization is carried out with the well-established three-field projection scheme. The post-processing aims to generate a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) file in an STL format. For this, the zero-level set of filtered density field is utilized to define the boundary of a topology optimization result. From the STL format CAD file, a design result is fabricated using additive manufacturing machines. The effectiveness of the MATLAB code is examined through three design examples including a simply supported beam, bridge, and airplane bearing bracket. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","3D arbitrary design domain; Additive manufacturing; Education; Topology optimization","Additives; Bearings (machine parts); Bridges; Computer aided design; MATLAB; Mesh generation; Topology; 3d arbitrary design domain; 3D meshes; Arbitrary geometry; Computer-aided design; Design domains; Design files; Design problems; Node-based; Open-source; Topology optimisation; 3D printers","","","","","National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (NRF-2019R1A2C1002808)","This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) (NRF-2019R1A2C1002808).

The lateral stiffness of piles plays a governing role on the fatigue limit state (FLS) and service limit state (SLS) of OWTs, so it needs to be further investigated. In this paper, laboratory-scale model tests and corresponding numerical analyses have been carried out to quantitatively evaluate the lateral static stiffness of monopiles in soft rocks under different scenarios. The results of pile responses, soil/rock resistance and the corresponding p-y curves are presented. Based on the experimental and numerical results, it is found that the load-sharing mechanisms of monopiles are significantly influenced by the rock-bearing layer. For modelling of rock-socked piles, p-y curves obtained by global curve fitting poorly describe the soil/rock resistance near the soil-rock interface, while p-y curves obtained by piecewise fitting for soil and rock layers or three-dimensional finite element model should be the preferred and recommended choices. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Lateral static stiffness;

The oscillating heat pipe (OHP), which was governed by thermally excited oscillating motion, was considered as a promising technology to dissipate high-density heat and had excellent application prospects in many important industrial processes. A flat-plate OHP, however, was fabricated by traditional welding methods, which were difficult and inefficient, resulting in increasing the cost and wasting the production time. In this work, we adopted a new metal 3D printing technology to develop an aluminum flat-plate OHP, which made it facile to build complex inner channels with high-precision molding at one time. AlSi10Mg powders, as raw materials, were selectively melted and solidified to form the container of the flat-plate OHP. The sintered inner surface presented excellent wettability to the working fluid, which facilitated the evaporation of the working fluid. Acetone was chosen as the working fluid, and the filling ratios with a range of 40–70% were loaded into the flat-plate oscillating heat pipe to analyze its effect on heat transfer performance. It was found that the 3D-printed flat-plate OHP with a 60% filling ratio had a better heat transfer performance and a lower thermal resistance, and it was able to work properly in both vertical and horizontal operation modes. The 3D-printed flat-plate OHP had been successfully applied for the thermal management of high-power LEDs, and the results showed that the temperature of LEDs was maintained within 60 °C, and its service life was prolonged. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing; heat transfer performance; oscillating heat pipe; thermal resistance","3D printing; Acetone; Aluminum; Aluminum plating; Fluids; Heat pipes; Heat transfer; Light emitting diodes; Oscillating flow; Plate metal; Plates (structural components); Temperature control; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Electronic technologies; Filling ratio; Flat plate; Heat transfer performance; High power; Higher integration; Oscillating heat pipes; Working fluid; Heat resistance","","","","","UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (105084); UK Research and Innovation, UKRI; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2019YFE0116400); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52106225); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (3132022213); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","The authors sincerely appreciate the financial support for this work from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2019YFE0116400), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52106225) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. 3132022213).","Yeh L., Review of heat transfer technologies in electronic equipment, J.

These materials, inspired by fish scales, take the form of either composite materials or multi-material discrete exoskeleton type structures. Over the last decade they have been under intense scrutiny for generating tailorable and tunable stiffness, penetration and fracture resistance, buckling prevention, nonlinear damping, hydrodynamic and camouflaging functions. Such programmable behavior emerges from leveraging their unique morphology and structure-property relationships. Several advanced tools for characterization, manufacturing, modeling and computation have been employed to understand and discover their behavior. With the rapid proliferation of additive manufacturing techniques and advances in modeling and computational methods, this field is seeing renewed efforts to realize even more ambitious designs.

We present a strategy for double networks in epoxy resin to further improve the performances of printed structures via two different processing methods. Epoxy acrylates and polyethylene glycol dimethacrylates crosslink by UV-light radiation forming a light-induced network structure, and epoxy molecules crosslink under γ-ray radiation forming a ray-induced network structure. The two kinds of networks interpenetrate to form the interpenetrating polymer network (IPN). The printed IPN specimens have the characteristics of high Young's modulus (up to 4.89 GPa) and fracture strain (as high as 30.4 %). The printed flowers and canister reinforced by short glass fibers (GFs) exhibited rapid shape recovery behaviors. The IPN epoxy/GFs composites have good values in manufacturing smart deployable structures, medical devices, and automobile shell parts. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","A. Polymer-matrix composites; A.

However, fatigue life data of WAAM HSLA steel is scarce. In this study, the mechanical properties and fatigue life of thin-walled HSLA steel parts fabricated by WAAM were assessed via non-destructive and destructive testing, providing a comprehensive analysis on this material's behaviour. The manufacturing conditions have a more pronounced effect on mechanical properties than the part's height, which seems not to influence the fatigue life of WAAM HSLA steels. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Fatigue; HSLA steel; Mechanical properties; Non-Destructive Testing (NDT); Wire and Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM)","3D printers; Additives; Fatigue of materials; High strength steel; Steel testing; Thin walled structures; Wire; Fatigue assessments; High flexibility; High productivity; HSLA steel; Mechanical characterizations; Mechanical fatigue; Non destructive testing; Non-destructive testing; Steel parts; Wire and arc additive manufacturing; Nondestructive examination","","","","","Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior, MCTES; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (UIDB/00667/2020); UNIDEMI, (UIDB/50022/2020)","The authors acknowledge Funda\u00E7\u00E3o para a Ci\u00EAncia e a Tecnologia (FCT - MCTES) for its financial support via project UIDB/00667/2020 (UNIDEMI) and project UIDB/50022/2020 (IDMEC under LAETA).

The core component of AMR is a porous magnetocaloric material that undergoes millions of thermal and magnetic field cycles throughout the device's lifetime, while immersed in a heat transfer fluid. Despite significant research spanning almost four decades, the chemical stability of MCMs continues to pose a critical engineering challenge. In this mini-review, research on the corrosion of room-temperature MCMs is discussed. Particular attention is given to Gd, Gd5Si2Ge2, and La(Fe,Si)13 and their compositional variants. Following a brief overview of the wide variety of corrosion monitoring methods used to evaluate magnetocaloric regenerator structures, corrosion inhibition mechanisms are discussed in the context of metallurgical, processing, and environmental factors. Finally, challenges associated with corrosion testing of magnetocaloric structures fabricated via additive manufacturing methods are presented. © 2022, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.","","Corrosion; Energy efficiency; Refrigeration; Silicon; Active magnetic regenerative refrigerations; Corrosivity; Energy efficient; Environmentally friendly alternatives; Harmful chemicals; High carbons; Magnetocaloric; Magnetocaloric materials; Refrigeration technology; Vapour compression refrigerations; Chemical stability","","","","","","","Center, Bipartisan Policy, Annual energy outlook 2020, Energy Information Administration, (2020); Kok M.T.J., De Coninck H.C., Environ.

Detecting and control defect is essential for a part by additive manufacturing to avoid further deterioration of the part accuracy. In this paper, a defect identification and compensation method for laser deposition manufacturing(LDM) is proposed to enhance the part quality. This work investigated the use of high-speed laser profiler to collect the surface point cloud concerning a part under building, and then these data were utilized to detect the defect region according to the given deviation threshold. Statistic filter, least-square method and projection approach were employed for deviation point cloud denoising, segmentation and contour extraction. An algorithm was presented to distinguish regions which needed compensation and generated corresponding scan path based on in-situ point cloud processing. The experimental results showed that the setup successful detected the geometric defects of the LDM part and controlled the machine motion system to deposit the deviation region, and the resulting part was more geometrically identical to the expected 3D representation. © 2022","Forming accuracy; Geometric defects; Laser deposition manufacturing; Point cloud","Deposition; Geometry; Least squares approximations; Control defects; Defect compensation; Defect identification; Detecting defects; Forming accuracy; Geometric defects; Identification method; Laser deposition manufacturing; Laser depositions; Point-clouds; Deterioration","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51975387); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by the [National natural science foundation of China] under Grant [ 51975387 ]","Ansari M., Jabari E., Toyserkani E., Opportunities and challenges in additive manufacturing of functionally graded metallic materials via powder-fed laser directed energy deposition: a review, J Mater Process Tech, 294, (2021); Alimardani M., Fallah V., Iravani-Tabrizipour M., Khajepour A., Surface finish in laser solid freeform fabrication of an AISI 303L stainless steel thin wall, Journal of Materials Processing Tech, 212, 1, pp. 113-119, (2012); Liu W.W., Tang Z.J., Liu X.Y., Wang H.J., Zhang H.C., A review on in-situ monitoring and adaptive control technology for laser cladding remanufacturing, Procedia CIRP, 61, pp. 235-240, (2017); Chen L., Yao X., Xu P., Moon S.K., Bi G., Rapid surface defect identification for additive manufacturing with in-situ point cloud processing and machine learning, Virtual and Physical Prototyping, 16, 1, pp. 50-67, (2021); Peng L., Yang T., Li S., Liu D., Hu Q., Xiong W., Zeng X., Direct laser fabrication of nickel alloy samples, Int.

Recent developments of additive manufacturing technologies allow to pursue new challenging metal structures, possibly designed on a case-by-case basis. Nevertheless, many studies in the literature have already pointed out the need for accurately defining the manufacturing limits of the technologies as well as the correlation between the geometries and the mechanical performance. In this frame, this paper is aimed at manufacturing and testing steel functionally graded strut-based lattice structures to map their mechanical properties as a function of the grading approach (uniform, size-graded and rod-graded) and the fractional density (15 %, 25 % and 35 %), even computing the calibration parameters to check the reliability of the usual Gibson-Ashby scaling laws. Results showed strut distortion and deviation from the designed geometry in samples with the lowest fractional density (15 %) and at thinner layers of the rod-graded geometries. Size-graded structures demonstrated higher mechanical properties, regardless of the fractional density. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Functionally graded materials; Gibson-Ashby; Lattice structures","Additives; Density (specific gravity); Functionally graded materials; Geometry; Grading; Struts; Additive manufacturing technology; Case base; Fractional density; Functionally graded steels; Gibson-ashby; Lattice structures; Mechanical feature; Metal structures; Physical features; Steel struts; 3D printers","","","","","Università degli Studi di Salerno, UNISA, (ORSA210552)","This work was funded by the University of Salerno , through project named Additive Manufacturing di componenti metallici alleggeriti a densità graduata (Additive Manufacturing of graded-density metal components), grant number ORSA210552 .","Ryan G., Pandit A., Apatsidis D., Fabrication methods of porous metals for use in orthopaedic applications, Biomaterials, 27, pp. 2651-2670, (2006); Bai, Gong, Chen, Sun, Zhang, Cai, Additive manufacturing of customized metallic orthopedic implants: materials, structures, and surface modifications, Metals (Basel), 9, (2019); Caiazzo F., Alfieri V., Bujazha B.D., Additive manufacturing of biomorphic scaffolds for bone tissue engineering, Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 113, pp. 2909-2923, (2021); Kelly C.N., Francovich J., Julmi S., Safranski D., Guldberg R.E., Maier H.J., Et al., Fatigue behavior of As-built selective laser melted titanium scaffolds with sheet-based gyroid microarchitecture for bone tissue engineering, Acta Biomater, 94, pp. 610-626, (2019); Dehghan-Manshadi A., Venezuela J., Demir A.G., Ye Q., Dargusch M.S., Additively manufactured fe-35Mn-1Ag lattice structures for biomedical applications, J Manuf Process, 80, pp. 642-650, (2022); Somiya S., Handbook of advanced ceramics : materials, applications, processing, and properties, (2013); Mahamood R.M., Akinlabi E.T., Types of functionally graded materials and their areas of application, pp. 9-21, (2017); Zhao M., Ji B., Zhang D.Z., Li H., Zhou H., Design and mechanical performances of a novel functionally graded sheet-based lattice structure, Addit Manuf, 52, (2022); Brothers A.H., Dunand D.C., Mechanical properties of a density-graded replicated aluminum foam, Mater Sci Eng A, 489, pp. 439-443, (2008); Maskery I., Aboulkhair N.T., Aremu A.O., Tuck C.J., Ashcroft I.A., Wildman R.D., Et al., A mechanical property evaluation of graded density Al-Si10-mg lattice structures manufactured by selective laser melting, Mater Sci Eng A, 670, pp. 264-274, (2016); Korkmaz M.E., Gupta M.K., Robak G., Moj K., Krolczyk G.M., Kuntoglu M., Development of lattice structure with selective laser melting process: a state of the art on properties, future trends and challenges, J Manuf Process, 81, pp. 1040-1063, (2022); Li W., Han B., Research and application of functionally gradient materials, IOP Conf Ser Mater Sci Eng, 394, (2018); Ruys A.J., Sutton B.A., Metal-ceramic functionally graded materials (FGMs), Met.

This work investigates whether thermal post processing treatments above the β-transus temperature at both standard atmospheric pressure and 1500 bar pressure (Hot Isostatic Pressing – HIPing) can refine the columnar morphology in the high strength Ti-3Al-8V-6Cr-4Mo-4Zr (Beta-C/ASTM Grade 19) alloy produced by AM. Heat treatment at standard atmospheric pressure was ineffective in modifying the coarse columnar microstructure but HIPing was found to promote new equiaxed grains and significantly refine the grain size by up to 72.5% compared to the as-built component. The strong dominant <001> texture characteristic of the as-built (and heat treated) alloy was weakened and shifted towards <103> with a 5-fold reduction in texture intensity after the HIPing process. EBSD analysis reveals evidence of grain recrystallisation processes including but not limited to discontinuous dynamic recrystallisation (DDRX) which may be associated with pore collapse. Primitive columnar grains were also shown to contain numerous substructures which may have formed through dynamic recovery (DRV). © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Grain refinement; Hot isostatic pressing; Recrystallisation; Titanium alloys","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Atmospheric pressure; Chromium alloys; Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; High strength alloys; Hot isostatic pressing; Molybdenum alloys; Morphology; Sintering; Textures; Zircaloy; Columnar grain structure; Grain morphologies; Grain textures; Grains refinement; Grainsize; Hot-isostatic pressings; Manufacturing IS; Recrystallisation; Thermal condition; Titanium (alloys); Titanium alloys","","","","","Queensland Centre for Advanced Materials Processing and Manufacturing; University of Queensland's School of Mechanical and Mining Engineering; Australian Research Council, ARC, (IH150100024); Australian Research Council, ARC; University of Queensland, UQ","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the University of Queensland's School of Mechanical and Mining Engineering and the Queensland Centre for Advanced Materials Processing and Manufacturing .

A cascaded superimposed high-birefringence fiber Bragg grating is used to determine the lasing wavelengths. The combination of a Fabry–Pérot filter and a single-coupler ring is adopted to achieve the single-longitudinal-mode (SLM) oscillation. By introducing the enhanced polarization-hole-burning effect to suppress the gain competition between different wavelength lasers, the stable lasing output is guaranteed. When the pump power is 200 mW, by adjusting the polarization controller to balance the gain and loss in the laser cavity, 24 switchable lasing modes are achieved, including 8 single-wavelength operations and 16 dual-wavelength operations with orthogonal polarization states. For single-wavelength operations, every laser is in the SLM lasing state, with a high stabilized optical spectrum, a linewidth of approximately 1 kHz, an optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) as high as 73 dB, a relative intensity noise of less than −150 dB/Hz, and very good polarization characteristics. For dual-wavelength operations, the lasers also have a stable spectrum and an OSNR as high as 65 dB. The proposed fiber laser has a wide range of applications, including long-haul coherence optical communication, optical fiber sensing, and dense wavelength-division-multiplexing. © 2022 by the authors.","fiber laser; narrow linewidth; single-longitudinal-mode; wavelength-switching","","","","","","Creative Ability Improvement Program of Hebei Province, China, (20542201D); Natural Science Foundation for Outstanding Young Scholars of Hebei Province, China, (F2020201001); Program of “333 talent project, (A202101010); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61827818, 61975049); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61975049 and 61827818), the Natural Science Foundation for Outstanding Young Scholars of Hebei Province, China (Grant No. F2020201001), the Program of “333 talent project” of Hebei Province, China (Grant No. A202101010), and the Creative Ability Improvement Program of Hebei Province, China (Grant No. 20542201D).","Kumar C., Kumar G., S + C double-band flattened gain hybrid optical amplifier [RAMAN + thulium-doped photonic crystal fiber amplifier (TD-PCFA)] for super-dense wavelength division multiplexing system, J.

In this paper, a strategy of bi-directional auxetic metamaterials with tunable effective Poisson's ratio is proposed. The bi-directional auxetic metamaterials based on two-dimensional double arrow structures are designed and then fabricated through additive manufacturing. The deformation mechanisms of the proposed structures are investigated through numerical simulations combined with experiments in the present study. The results show that the relative specific stiffness and the effective Poisson's ratios of the proposed structures depend on geometrical parameters and geometrical configuration. The relative specific stiffness of the three-dimensional cubic structure (TCU) is between the internal and external stiffness of the structure, as is the case of the effective Poisson's ratio. The axisymmetric deformation mechanism of the three-dimensional cylindrical structure (TCY) generates transversely isotropic Poisson's ratio and enhances stiffness compared to the TCU with the same geometric parameters. This work systematically characterizes the deformation mechanism of innovatively designed structures and widens the potential applications of metamaterials in the fields of machinery, encompassing biomedicine, and electronic devices. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Bi-directional auxetic metamaterials;

Environmentally friendly practices have been considered basic requirements for companies. Particularly, because information services companies are more likely to sell environmentally hazardous products compared with other industries, these companies must place a stronger emphasis on environmental protection. Therefore, this study constructed an innovative service model for the information services industry based on the sustainability balanced scorecard. Grounded in traditional balanced scorecard dimensions adjusted to “learning and growth,” “internal process,” “customers,” “finance and economy,” “social performance,” and “environmental performance,” the study included an extensive literature review and 39 preliminarily compiled evaluation criteria of sustainable operations performance in the information services industry. A hybrid analytical method integrating the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM), Kano two-dimensional quality model, and theory of innovative problem solving (TRIZ) was proposed. The FDM was used to filter 26 criteria out of 36 from the consensus of 62 experts from related fields. A revised Kano quality model was then applied to examine key criteria that influence the sustainable operations of the information services industry, obtaining 22 “one-dimensional,” 3 “must-be,” and 1 “attractive” sustainable operations element(s). Furthermore, this study adopted TRIZ to conduct the fitting between engineering and service parameters. Six key service parameters (criteria) covering all three sustainable development dimensions were selected, with which a contradiction matrix of the service quality of the information services industry was constructed. Finally, corresponding to the innovative principles of a contradiction matrix, an innovative service solution was developed to serve as a reference for information services–related companies implementing innovative service in their sustainable business strategies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Fuzzy Delphi method (FDM);

Determining the recyclability of a powder batch, however, requires continuous monitoring of the powder conditions during processing—notably the oxygen content—to avoid waste of resources while maintaining high build quality standards. In this work, we present a rapid and inexpensive method to acquire this information optically during the powder recoating step. Using a “powder bed scanner”, we capture high-resolution optical images of different powder batches and compute their relative oxygen content by assessing the colour of individual powder particles, which is a function of the surface oxide layer thickness. We compare these measurements against those obtained using conventional techniques and confirm that our method yields higher sensitivity and more consistent results. This work pinpoints a pathway to improving the recyclability of metal powders—at least of those which are heat-tintable—through continuous monitoring of their appearance during AM processes. © 2022","Powder characterization; Powder degradation; Powder oxidation; Powder recycling; Powder rejuvenating","Additives; Geometrical optics; Metals; Monitoring; Oxygen; Powder metals; Additive manufacturing process; Continuous monitoring; Optical based methods; Oxygen content; Powder characterization; Powder degradation; Powder oxidation; Powder recycling; Powder rejuvenating; Recyclability; Recycling","","","","","Additive Microstructure Engineering; National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF, (NRF-NRFF2018-05); Nanyang Technological University, NTU; School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering","Funding text 1: This work was funded by the National Research Foundation Fellowship (NRFF), NRF-NRFF2018-05 and supported by Nanyang Technological University Singapore (NTU).

As a demonstration, an easily available polymer of polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) with the solute loading of Polyethylene glycol (PEG) was designed for the potential biomedical applications. The maximum soluble concentration of PEG in PEGDA is less than 10 wt% at room temperature while the concentration reaches to 30 % with the temperature of 70 ℃. The comparative experiments proved that the concentration of high molecular weight PEG had a positive effect on the mechanical property of the PEGDA resin. The hardness of the sample printed by the PEGDA resin with PEG by the concentration of 30 wt% is three times higher than that of the PEGDA resin without solute. As the concentration of PEG increases from 15 wt% to 30 wt%, the Young's modulus has been enhanced from 67.9 MPa to 131.4 MPa while the Young's modulus for the PEGDA resin without solute is 39.6 MPa. The compression tests with 3D printed lattice structure illustrated that the compressive modulus of the PGEDA resin has been improved by nearly 600 % with the 30 wt% of PEG. The cell proliferation experiments showed that the PEGDA resin with the loading of PEG led to the higher cell activity comparing to the PEGDA resin without solute. The results indicate that the thermally assisted 3D printed PEGDA resin with the high loading of PEG has excellent mechanical properties for the potential biomedical application. This study is expected to demonstrate the thermally assisted stereolithography 3D printing process for the polymer with high solute loading, which contributes to explore the printable materials with improved performance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; PEGDA; Stereolithography; Thermally assisted","Biomechanics; Cell proliferation; Compression testing; Elastic moduli; Medical applications; Resins; Stereolithography; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Bio-polymers; Biomedical applications; Flowability; Performance; Poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylates; Thermal assistance; Thermally assisted; Young modulus; Polyethylene glycols","","","","","Sichuan University, SCU; Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, (20200731211324001, GJHZ20210705141803011, JCYJ20190808144009478); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (20822041F4049)","This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( 20822041F4049 ), Sichuan University , and Shenzhen Science and Technology Program ( GJHZ20210705141803011 , 20200731211324001 , JCYJ20190808144009478 ).

Polylactic acid is an exceedingly popular biodegradable polymer commonly used in material extrusion 3D printing. As a promising alternative to petroleum based polymers, PLA has found use in the medical, textile, and packaging industries due to its biocompatibility, renewability, and good mechanical properties. Several process parameters in the material extrusion printing technique can alter physical characteristics of a part such as, print speed, extrusion (nozzle) temperature, layer thickness, and infill density; which have led to several studies on 3D printed PLA. Albeit, the surface texture and viscoelasticity of 3D printed and ironed PLA has yet to be reported upon. This study utilizes a fractional factorial design as the basis for an experimental design, in order to correlate the impacts these process parameters have on the surface morphology and viscoelasticity of 3D printed and ironed PLA. In this study, samples were produced using the material extrusion additive manufacturing process with PLA as the feedstock material. Twenty-seven iterations were 3D printed; each with varying process parameters dictated by the fractional factorial design. The (1) surface morphology, (2) surface roughness, and (3) thermo-mechanical (visco-elastic) properties of these samples were investigated to report on the effect of the ironing process. The surface texture was observed to produce a more uniform and smoother surface when ironed. Additionally, the storage modulus and glass transition temperature of the 3D printed and ironed PLA is shown to be dependent on the process parameters mentioned above. Parametric control of physical characteristics of 3D printed materials can benefit the research and development of existing materials, improving the additive manufacturing process, and can be applied to a wide range of engineering applications. This study contributes to understanding the control of the abovementioned material properties through process parameter modification. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Material extrusion; PLA; Surface morphology; Surface roughness; Visco-elastic properties","3D printers; Additives; Biocompatibility; Biodegradable polymers; Extrusion; Glass transition; Industrial research; Polyesters; Surface morphology; Surface roughness; Textures; Viscoelasticity; Additive manufacturing process; Fractional factorial designs; Ironing process; Material extrusion; Physical characteristics; Polylactic acid; Process parameters; Surface textures; Thermomechanical properties; Viscoelastic properties; Morphology","","","","","Engineering Technology and Commonwealth Engineering; Pennsylvania State University, PSU","Matt Caputo, Ola Rashwan and Daudi Waryoba gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by Engineering Technology and Commonwealth Engineering (ETCE), Pennsylvania State University.

Industrial systems and civil structures vibrate dissipating an important amount of energy that can be harvested to power small devices. This work continues and extends a previous work from the authors (Castagnetti 2019 Meccanica 54 749-60). Here we improved that initial configuration by proposing a tunable multi-arm electromagnetic pendulum for ultra-low frequency vibrations energy harvesting. This configuration features five electromagnetic converters and a magnetic spring, each supported by a pendulum arm with different length: when excited by external vibrations, this six arms frame is free to oscillate around a central pivot. The paper starts from conceptual design, includes a detailed multiphysics dynamic simulation implemented with Matlab Simscape software, presents the prototype development through three-dimensional printing and experimental validation. Systematic experimental tests investigated different pendulum configurations for three stiffness levels of the magnetic spring and confirmed both the ultra-low frequency response (from 2 to 10 Hz), as predicted by the dynamic simulation, and the good voltage and power outputs. Specifically, for the higher stiffness of the magnetic spring, corresponding to an oscillation frequency of about 9.5 Hz, the power output was up to 8.4 mW and the output voltage of about 2 Volt. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.","analytical model; electromagnetic converter; energy harvester; experimental assessment; pendulum; tunable system","Conceptual design; Excited states; Frequency response; Pendulums; Stiffness; Vibration analysis; Electromagnetic converters; Electromagnetics; Energy Harvester; Experimental assessment; Low-frequency vibration; Magnetic spring; Tunable systems; Tunables; Ultra low frequencies; Vibration energy harvesting; MATLAB","","","","","","","Jia D, Liu J, Human power-based energy harvesting strategies for mobile electronic devices, Front.

Chamfered ridges which avoid the appearance of undesired supports when printed vertically (i.e., along the propagation axis of the filter) are considered. This strategy ensures accurate tolerances, reduced cost and it also enables monolithic manufacturing of the EMF as part of a feed chain. A circuit model is developed to explain the behavior of the new ridges as well as to speed up the overall filter design. The proposed concept and methodology are validated experimentally through the manufacturing and measurement of a prototype. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","3-D-printing; additive manufacturing (AM); equivalent circuits; evanescent mode filters (EMFs); microwave filters","3D printers; Behavioral research; Circuit simulation; Electric impedance; Microwave circuits; Microwave filters; Microwave resonators; Timing circuits; Topology; 3-D printing; Additive manufacturing; Behavioral science; Evanescent mode; Evanescent mode filter; Impedance; Integrated circuit modeling; Load modeling; Manufacturing; Mode filters; Equivalent circuits","","","","","","","Addamo G., Et al., Additive manufacturing of Ka-band dual-polarization waveguide components, IEEE Trans.

In this work, we found that hydrogen absorption can embrittle the NbTaTiZr RHEA and promote intragranular fracture due to segregation of hydrogen atoms at grain boundaries. Synergistic effects of the hydrogenation temperature and time on the pulverization behavior of the NbTaTiZr RHEA were investigated, and the relation between grain sizes in the original ingots and particle sizes in the pulverized powders was explored. The present findings not only provide a highly efficient approach to produce high-quality powders of alloys with high-melting points, but also shed light into understanding hydrogen embrittlement of RHEAs. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","High-entropy alloy; Hydrogen embrittlement; Powder","Atoms; Entropy; Grain boundaries; High-entropy alloys; Melting point; Metal castings; Niobium alloys; Powder metallurgy; Segregation (metallography); Alloy powder; Grain-boundaries; High entropy alloys; High melting; High quality; Hydrogen absorption; Hydrogen atoms; Intragranular fractures; Manufacturing IS; Powder production; Powders","","","","","Foreign Language & Business Department of Guangdong Women's Polytechnic Colleage; Funds for Creative Research Groups of China, (51921001); SKLAMM-USTB, (2018Z-01); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51871016); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project, (BP0719004); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University, (51971017, IRT_14R05); Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University","Funding text 1: This research was supported financially by the Funds for Creative Research Groups of China (grant no. 51921001), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 51871016), the 111 Project (grant no.

It can reduce the microorganism activity during sugar fermentation using OPF solution. In the current study, a hollow fiber supported liquid membrane (HFSLM) system using hybrid polyethersulfone-graphene membrane support and organic liquid membrane phase of 0.5 M tri-n-octyl amine carrier in a 2-ethyl-1-hexanol diluent was used to remove the AA. The liquid membrane impregnation time and the flow operation modes of the feed and strip phases in the HFSLM configuration were investigated. Mode I was operated with the feed phase flow inside the hollow fiber (HF) lumen and the stripping phase flow at the shell side. In mode II, the feed phase entered at the shell side and the stripping phase at the lumen of the HF support. The best liquid membrane impregnation time was 4 hours, exhibiting the highest AA removal efficiency of 80% compared to 1 and 24 hours of impregnation time. The removal efficiency of the AA was 80.1% and 42.4% using mode I and mode II, respectively, at 8 hours of the supported liquid membrane (SLM) running time. HFSLM was applied to remove AA from real OPF biomass hydrolysate. It was found that the AA concentration had reduced from 6.83 to 2.01 g/L after the SLM process. The SLM process did not affect the concentration of other components, especially sugar compounds in the OPF biomass hydrolysate. © 2022, National University of Malaysia.

In recent years, technological developments have facilitated the fabrication of steel components and structures using additive manufacturing technologies. Among the existing technologies, the Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) technique has proven to offer great potentials for fabrication of large-scale structures. The present study investigates the corrosion-fatigue crack growth (CFCG) behaviour of the WAAM parts fabricated using ER70S-6 low carbon steel wire to assess the suitability of this technology for future marine structures. In this experimental study, the cracking behaviour and test duration in corrosion-fatigue tests were investigated and analysed in conjunction with the microstructural examination of the tested specimens. Moreover, the obtained results were compared with the recommended trends available in BS7910 standard for conventional welded joints and the data available in the literature on widely used offshore structural steel weldments. The CFCG results obtained from this study contribute to the overall knowledge and design requirements for the new optimised functionally graded structures made with WAAM technology for marine applications. © 2022 The Author(s)","","3D printers; Building materials; Fatigue crack propagation; Fatigue testing; Low carbon steel; Offshore oil well production; Offshore structures; Seawater corrosion; Steel corrosion; Welding; Welds; Additive manufacturing technology; Corrosion-fatigue; Fatigue crack growth behavior; Fatigue loadings; Loading condition; Marine environment; Seawater environment; Steel parts; Structural integrity assessment; Wire arc; Additives","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC","This work was supported by grant EP/L016303/1 for Cranfield, Oxford and Strathclyde Universities' Centre for Doctoral Training in Renewable Energy Marine Structures–REMS CDT ( http://www.rems-cdt.ac.uk/ ) from the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) .","Adedipe O., Brennan F., Kolios A., Corrosion fatigue load frequency sensitivity analysis, Mar.

A significant majority of this research effort has focused on 3-D printing of a fresh concrete mix. The authors propose a very different approach for the utilization of 3-D printing in civil engineering based on plastic spatial reinforcing elements for concrete. The mechanical properties of 3-D printed plastics are significantly lower than those of traditional steel re-bars; however, the unconventional and spatial geometric shapes of plastic reinforcement can minimize some of these differences. In the conducted research program, gyroids were harnessed as spatial reinforcing elements that are unachievable using traditional reinforcing techniques. The properties of the tested plastic-mortar elements were highly quasi-plastic and similar to those of good-quality steel fiber-reinforced concrete. The flexural characteristics of plastic-mortar elements enable the testing of possible substitutes for steel reinforcements. Areas of future research and current applications of plastic-mortar elements are discussed. © 2022","ABS; Gyroid; Mortar; Reinforcement","3D printers; ABS resins; Concrete mixtures; Fiber reinforced materials; Industrial research; Mortar; Reinforced plastics; 3-D printing; ABS; Additive manufacturing technology; Gyroids; Mortar beams; Mortar element; Plastic mortars; Reinforcing elements; Research efforts; Technological development; Steel fibers","","","","","MC-Bauchemie","The research team would like to thank MC-Bauchemie (Środa Wielkopolska, Poland) for donating the admixtures to the research program.","Zhang H.Z., Liu X., Yi W.J., Reinforcement layout optimisation of RC D-regions, Adv.

On the one hand, there are opportunities for individuals and businesses to build and improve services and applications based on their requirements in the SDN. On the other hand, SDN poses a new array of privacy and security threats, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. For detecting and mitigating potential threats, Machine Learning (ML) is an effective approach that has a quick response to anomalies. In this article, we analyse and compare the performance, using different ML techniques, to detect DDoS attacks in SDN, where both experimental datasets and self-generated traffic data are evaluated. Moreover, we propose a simple supervised learning (SL) model to detect flooding DDoS attacks against the SDN controller via the fluctuation of flows. By dividing a test round into multiple pieces, the statistics within each time slot reflects the variation of network behaviours. And this ”trend” can be recruited as samples to train a predictor to understand the network status, as well as to detect DDoS attacks. We verify the outcome through simulations and measurements over a real testbed. Our main goal is to find a lightweight SL model to detect DDoS attacks with data and features that can be easily obtained. Our results show that SL is able to detect DDoS attacks with a single feature. The performance of the analysed SL algorithms is influenced by the size of training set and parameters used. The accuracy of prediction using the same SL model could be entirely different depending on the training set. © 2022","Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS); Machine learning; Network Security; OpenFlow; Software Defined Networks (SDN)","","","","","","","","Wibowo F.X., Gregory M.A., Ahmed K., Gomez K.M.; Xia W., Wen Y., Foh C.H., Niyato D., Xie H., A survey on software-defined networking, IEEE Commun.

The microstructure obtained from extrusion-based techniques differs greatly from the ones obtained by beam-based additive manufacturing, as a sintering process is used, in contrast to the rapid solidification of a melt pool. In this study, the microstructure of 316L stainless steel fabricated by filament extrusion is investigated as a function of debinding and sintering conditions. High-speed nanoindentation correlated with energy-dispersive X-ray mapping is employed for microstructural characterization. High sintering temperatures of 1350 °C, an atmosphere of pure H2, and a cooling rate of 60 K/m are found to result in the optimal microstructure. High densities are obtained due to accelerated densification, enabled by the introduction of diffusion paths due to δ-ferrite formation. At the same time, hard phases like oxides or σ-precipitates with detrimental effects on the mechanical properties can be avoided. It is shown that the porosity can be quantified by analysis of hardness and modulus data from nanoindentation mapping. The values obtained are in good agreement with optical and Archimedes immersion method measurements. Tensile tests of 3D-printed and sintered specimens show excellent ductility and strength in comparison to literature. We demonstrate that 3D printing of 316L filaments and sintering with the optimized conditions results in material properties comparable to bulk values. © 2022 The Author(s)","Fused deposition modeling of metals; Fused filament fabrication of metals; High-speed nanoindentation mapping; Porosity analysis; Sintering of 316L steel","3D printers; Additives; Austenitic stainless steel; Extrusion; Fabrication; Microstructure; Nanoindentation; Porosity; Rapid solidification; Sintering; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; 316 L stainless steel; 316L steel; Fused deposition modeling of metal; Fused filament fabrication of metal; High Speed; High-speed nanoindentation mapping; Nano indentation; Porosity analysis; Sintering condition; Sintering of 316l steel; Mapping","","","","","Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich, ETH","The authors would like to acknowledge the numerous contributions to this work.

Solutions of nonlinear equations and time-domain integration are combined to compute the response sensitivities, which consist of three steps: firstly, the nonlinear differential equations of motion are solved using Newton–Raphson iteration to obtain the transient response; secondly, the algebraic equations of the sensitivity are obtained by differentiating the incremental equation of motion with respect to nonlinear coefficients; thirdly, the nonlinear transient response sensitivities are determined using the Newmark-β integration in the interested time range. Three validation studies, including a Duffing oscillator, a nonlinear multiple-degrees-of-freedom (MDOF) system, and a cantilever beam with local nonlinearity, are adopted to illustrate the application of the proposed method. The comparisons among the finite difference method (FDM), the Poincaré method (PCM), the Lindstedt–Poincaré method (LPM), and the proposed method are conducted. The key factors, such as the parameter perturbation step size, the secular term, and the time step, are discussed to verify the accuracy and efficiency. Results show that parameter perturbation selection in the FDM sensitivity analysis is related to the nonlinear features depending on the initial condition; the consistency of the transient response sensitivity can be improved based on the accurate nonlinear response when a small time step is adopted in the proposed method. © 2022 by the authors.","direct differentiation method; local nonlinearity; nonlinear dynamic response; sensitivity analysis","","","","","","Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing, (cstc2021jcyj-bshX0106)","This research was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing (No. cstc2021jcyj-bshX0106).","Qian G., Mahdi A., Sensitivity Analysis Methods in the Biomedical Sciences, Math.

Currently, there is a lack of quantitative understanding of the tempering kinetics for Grade 91 steel, and as a result, the effects of repeated thermal cycles on properties for different processing conditions cannot be determined. Here we evaluate the tempering kinetics by determining the constant terms in the Johnson Mehl Avrami kinetic equation from the tempering data available in the literature and the thermal cycles computed using a rigorously-tested heat and fluid flow model of multi-layer additive manufacturing. The raw tempering data are cleaned using a neural network to enhance accuracy. The lower layers experience repeating cycles of heating and cooling when the upper layers are added. As a result, the hardness is reduced owing to the tempering of martensite. In contrast, martensite formed in the upper layers is not tempered to the same extent and the hardness remains high. Therefore, the hardness of the part increases with the distance from the substrate. Variations in the heat input at different laser powers and scanning speeds significantly affect the extent of tempering. Since the method used here can provide a quantitative understanding of the tempering of martensite and the spatial variation of hardness, it can be used to tailor the microstructure and hardness of heat treatable printed metallic parts. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","3D printing; Directed energy deposition; Grade 91 steel; Heat transfer and fluid flow; Johnson Mehl Avrami; Martensite; Neural network","Additives; Hardness; Heat transfer; Integral equations; Kinetics; Martensite; Melting; Multilayers; Thermal cycling; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Directed energy; Directed energy deposition; Energy depositions; Grade 91 steel; Heat transfer and fluid flow; Johnson-mehl-avrami; Neural-networks; Thermal; 3D printers","","","","","Office of Nuclear Energy, NE, (19–17206)","This work was supported by the funding received from the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy 's Nuclear Energy Enabling Technologies Program, as part of project 19–17206 of the Advanced Methods for Manufacturing Program.

The understanding of such a mass transfer mechanism is necessary for developing and optimizing laser-assisted processes of additive manufacturing. Powder bed surface relief around the remelted track is experimentally characterized by metallography and laser scanning profilometry in single-track experiments with powders of various materials and various particle sizes. Denudation zones with sharp irregular boundaries containing particle agglomerates are observed for finer powders with smaller particles. Denudation zones without well-defined boundaries containing single particles are observed for coarser powders. The balance of forces applied to a particle is theoretically analyzed to understand powder rearrangement in the laser-interaction zone. The drag force is estimated by a similarity point-source model of the entrainment flow with a correction for the finite size of the evaporation spot. The adhesion force appears to be greater than the gravity one for the fine powders and lower than the gravity for the coarse powders, thus explaining the observed difference in the denudation zone morphology. The measured variation of the denudation width with the material properties and the particle size is consistent with the theoretical predictions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Additive manufacturing; Drag force; Entrainment flow; Friction; Gravity; Laser powder bed fusion; Selective laser melting; Shear stress; Van der Waals force","Additives; Drag; Mass transfer; Melting; Morphology; Particle size; Powders; Shear flow; Shear stress; Van der Waals forces; Bed surface; Drag forces; Entrainment flow; Interaction zone; Laser interaction; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; Selective laser melting; Van der waals' forces; 3D printers","","","","","Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka, (075–15-2021–695); Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka; Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (21–79-30058); Russian Science Foundation, RSF","This work was supported by the Russian Science Foundation (grant agreement no. 21–79-30058).

The following study investigates the adhesion dynamics of the initial printed layer across parameters such as surface energies, stand-off heights, and extrusion speeds of up to 100 mm/s, using an applied in-situ thermal analysis technique. Observations indicate that the characteristic length parameter, Lc < 0.05 mm, is adequate in anchoring the thermal melt, which adheres to the substrate when the nozzle proximity to the surface increases. Up to 100% molten area is contacting the surface prior to translation, and a final eccentricity over 0.85 has been observed. Through an analysis of variance, operational parameters of lower nozzle heights, printing speeds, and higher surface energy were statistically significant. The resultant in-situ characterization-driven data, was used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN). The model tested at an accuracy of 90.9%, and was able to distinguish between failed prints and initially adhered structures. © 2022 The Authors","","","","","","","FAMU-FSU College of Engineering; High-Performance Materials Institute; NSF-RISE, (1646897); University of Florida, UF","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the NSF-RISE High-Performance Additive Manufacturing of Composite Structures via Development of Reconfigurable Cyber-Physical Robotic (CPR) Systems, Award #1646897.

The proposed half-Luneburg lens antenna provides a compact alternative to planar beamformers such as conventional Luneburg and Rotman lenses, as well as pillbox antennas. Importantly, we demonstrate that the peak gain of the half-Luneburg lens antenna is less than 1 dB lower than the peak gain of a conventional Luneburg lens antenna, despite being almost half the size. The proposed antenna can steer its beam in a 50° range with scan losses lower than 2 dB and side lobe levels below -10 dB. The proposed design is validated experimentally with a robust and cost-effective implementation using additive manufacturing.  © 2002-2011 IEEE.","Additive manufacturing; dielectric lens antennas; glide symmetry; half-Luneburg lens","Additives; Antenna lobes; Cost effectiveness; Dielectric materials; Lens antennas; Antennas measurement; Antennas radiation patterns; Dielectric lens antenna; Dielectric structure; Feed; Glide symmetry; Half-luneburg lens; Luneburg lens; Surface impedances; Symmetrics; 3D printers","","","","","European Space Agency, ESA, (4000125905/18/NL); Vetenskapsrådet, VR, (2019-03933)","The work of Oscar Quevedo-Teruel was supported by the VR Project 2019-03933 under call ""Research project grant within natural and engineering sciences.""

The properties of auto-correlation function (ACF), cross correlation, and effective bandwidth of the generated multiple chaos signals are systematically investigated in ACSLs networks with different topology and network sizes. The results show that not only delta-like ACF traces are obtained but also low cross correlations are observed in the chaotic signals outputted by ACSLs networks. Besides, the average effective bandwidth of generated multi-channel chaos can be greater than 20 GHz over a wide dynamic operation range. Moreover, the delta-like ACF, low correlation and wideband properties of multiple chaotic signals are robust to parameter mismatches between SLs. This work realizes wideband multi-channel chaos generation that simultaneously achieves delta-like ACF and low correlation, and is valuable for the applications in high-speed random bit generator, accurate multi-target, multi-angle radar detection, and ultrafast photonic decision making. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Delta-like autocorrelation; Low correlation; Multi-channel chaos; Semiconductor lasers network","Bandwidth; Decision making; Number theory; Semiconductor lasers; Tracking radar; Auto correlation; Autocorrelation functions; Chaos generation; Chaos signals; Coupled semiconductor lasers; Delta-like autocorrelation; Lower correlation; Multi channel; Multi-channel chaos; Semiconductor laser network; Autocorrelation","","","","","Optical Fiber Sensing and Communications; Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program, (2021JDJQ0023); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61671119, 61805031, 62171087); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (ZYGX2021K010); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, STCSM, (SKLSFO2020-05); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (ZYGX2019J003)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62171087, Grant 61671119, and Grant 61805031, in part by the Sichuan Science and Technology Program under Grant 2021JDJQ0023, in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant ZYGX2019J003, in part by the Exchange Project for Key Lab of Optical Fiber Sensing and Communications (Ministry of Education of China) under Grant ZYGX2021K010, and in part by STCSM under Grant SKLSFO2020-05.

These include aerial laser scanning, for which Risley prisms are used. In Risley systems, the so-called inverse problem, which focuses on obtaining the angles of the prisms for a given target coordinate, has not yet been solved mathematically. As a consequence, approximate approaches have been used, but the solutions obtained have significant errors and a lack of precision. To improve accuracy, iterative methods, which are computationally intensive, have also been implemented. In this paper, an analytical process which we call the geometric method is presented, and we verified that this strategy highly improves accuracy and computational speed. Using this method in an iterative process gives accuracies of up to 1 pm in only three iterations. This high accuracy would allow the geometric method to be applied in fields such as lithography, stereolithography, or 3D printing. © 2022 by the authors.","geometrical optics; inverse solution; Risley prism; rotational wedges","","","","","","","","Jianfeng S., Liren L., Maojin Y., Lingyu W., Mingli Z., The effect of the rotating double-prism wide-angle laser beam scanner on the beam shape, Optik, 116, pp. 553-556, (2005); Church P., Matheson J., Cao X., Roy G., Evaluation of a steerable 3D laser scanner using a double Risley prism pair, Degrad.

Emphasis is on the design of coupled inductor (CI) and boost inductor. In order to achieve a modular scheme with interleaved operation, indirect coupling between converters is realized using the secondary loop (SL)-based interconnection with inserted impedance. Here the 'SL' serves as an additional pass for average grid side currents for N channels. A building block type configuration has been proposed using this topology, inspired by the power electronics building block (PEBB) nature. The purpose of the loop is to interconnect the parallel converters in series using an arrangement of CIs. In addition, a boost inductor has been introduced in the SL to realize a power factor correction rectifier operation. The CI serves as the circulating current filter while reflecting channel currents toward the SL. To meet conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI) limits, a two-stage LCLC filter has been integrated with the FBB by introducing the point of common coupling (PCC) connection between two stages for filter size reduction. A design procedure is presented to meet power quality, circulating current, and EMI limits as per industry standards (EN-55011 and IEEE-519/1594). The proposed FBB has been characterized using 3L-NPC converters enabled with 1.2 kV Silicon Carbide based modules with comprehensive performance validation up to three channels in parallel with 15-kW power rating per channel. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Circulating current; interleaving; modular filter; NPC; optimization; secondary loop (SL) filter building block (FBB)","Architectural design; Electric inductors; Electric rectifiers; Electromagnetic pulse; Magnetic separation; Rectifying circuits; Silicon carbide; Building blockes; Circulating current; Inductor; Interleavings; Loop filter; Modular filters; NPC; Optimisations; Power harmonic filters; Secondary loop filter building block; Secondary loops; Harmonic analysis","","","","","","","Mondal G., Neumeister M., Hensler A., Nielebock S., Modular parallel interleaved converter for high current application, Proc.

As the microstructural evolution of the latter has not been fully illuminated yet, this work intends to shed light on the influence of in-situ tempering processes on microstructure development and to clarify the influence of residual stresses on phase stability. Hence, a carbon-bearing cold-work tool steel was processed via LPBF without base plate preheating. Besides well-established techniques such as light optical and scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction phase analysis showed significant differences depending on whether weld bead layers were in-situ tempered during LPBF or not. These tempered layers yielded higher austenite and lower carbide contents than the non-tempered top layers. To distinguish between different phases within the matrix, which is surrounded by a eutectic carbide network, correlative energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electron backscatter diffraction analysis and atom probe tomography (APT) were carried out. Neither the atomic resolution in APT delivered conclusive differences in chemical composition between martensite and austenite. Therefore, another austenite stabilization mechanism has to prevail for the investigated alloy, i.e., stress-related stabilization. This phenomenon was addressed by the evaluation of strain profile measurements in dependence of the part height. These experiments were performed by cross-sectional synchrotron micro-diffraction. Results showed that sample preparation has a great influence on the determined austenite amounts. Material removing processes, such as cutting, grinding, polishing, focused ion beam milling or ion slicing were made responsible for attenuating respectively extinguishing austenite phase stability. © 2022 The Authors","Atom probe tomography; High-energy X-ray diffraction; Laser powder bed fusion; Microstructure evolution; Phase stability; Tool steel","Atom lasers; Atoms; Carbides; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Grain refinement; Ion beams; Microstructural evolution; Phase stability; Probes; Residual stresses; Scanning electron microscopy; Stabilization; Tool steel; Atom-probe tomography; Cold work tool steels; Economic benefits; High energy X ray; High-energy X-ray diffraction; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Microstructure evolutions; Powder bed; X- ray diffractions; X ray diffraction","","","","","Austrian BMK, (846933); Österreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft, FFG, (861496)","This work was supported by the Austrian BMK ( 846933 ) in the framework of the program “Production of the future” and the “ BMK Professorship for Industry ”.

To address this issue, a polyethersulfone (PES)-based polymer matrix composite material, in which PES serves as a binder between particles of limestone powder, is introduced to prepare composite artificial stone parts using the selective laser sintering technology. Preliminary single-factor experiments were conducted for sintered limestone/PES (LPES) composite parts with different component ratios (R), laser sintering power (P), and powder bed preheating temperature (T) to determine the range of test parameters. Subsequently, using the laser power (x1), scanning speed (x2), scan spacing (x3), and layer thickness (x4) as experimental factors and the impact strength (y1) and dimensional accuracy along X, Y, and Z directions, respectively (y2, y3, and y4), of impact sintered parts as experimental indices, a four-factor three-level orthogonal experiment was conducted for optimization. The optimal combination of parameters affecting the multiobjective function within the tested range was obtained: laser power (15 W), scanning speed (1800 mm/s), scan spacing (0.1 mm), and layer thickness (0.1 mm). For this optimal combination, the sintered LPES model possesses an impact strength of 170.69 MPa and dimensional accuracies of 98.29% along the X direction, 97.36% along the Y direction, and 92.81% along the Z direction. Compared with a pure PES specimen, the impact strength was improved by 42.89%, and the dimensional accuracy was improved by 0.91% along the X direction, 1.23% along the Y direction, and 3.43% along the Z direction. © 2022, ASM International.","dimensional accuracy; LPES composites; orthogonal test; selective Laser Sintering technique; sintering process","Impact strength; Laser heating; Lime; Polymer matrix composites; Selective laser sintering; Sintering; Dimensional accuracy; Laser sintering techniques; Limestone powder; Limestone/PES composite; Orthogonal test; Poly(ether sulfone); Polyether sulfone; Selective laser sintering technique; Sintering process; Z-directions; Limestone","","","","","Harbin City Science and Technology Innovation Talent Research Special Fund Project, (2017RAQXJ118); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFD0601004)","This research is supported by Harbin City Science and Technology Innovation Talent Research Special Fund Project (Grant No: 2017RAQXJ118), the Key National Research and Development Programs (2017YFD0601004).

These properties are strongly influenced by the production process of the powder and its feedstock. In the scope of this work, the influence of three different powder producers of Ti6Al4V, on density, chemical composition, and mechanical properties of build samples, is investigated. Furthermore, the effects of the varying atomization process on morphology, particle size distribution, chemical composition, and oxide layers are studied. Particle size distribution and flowability seem to have a minor influence on the production process while density depends highly on the surface topology, sphericity, and nature of the oxide layer, which affect energy intake. Tensile properties are highly influenced by chemical composition, mainly dissolved oxygen, and polluting satellites, while notched bar impact strength is additionally influenced by the oxide layer and suspected TiO2 precipitations caused by it. © 2022, The Author(s).","L-PBF; Oxide layer; Powder production process; Powder properties; SLM; Ti6Al4V","Aluminum alloys; Density (specific gravity); Dissolved oxygen; Grain size and shape; Impact strength; Light transmission; Morphology; Particle size analysis; Size distribution; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Titanium dioxide; Chemical compositions; L-PBF; Oxide layer; Particles-size distributions; Powder production; Powder production process; Powder properties; Production process; Production properties; SLM; Particle size","","","","","Austrian Research Promotion Agency program Take-off, (3859424, 861050); Federal Ministry Republic of Austria; TU Graz Open Access Publishing Fund; Österreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft, FFG","Open access funding provided by JOANNEUM RESEARCH Forschungsgesellschaft mbH.

In addition, compared with clinically-used PRP-gel, the filamentous 3D stent could effectively reduce the frequency of PRP administration by 50–75% during wound treatment while also showing better therapeutic effects. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Multi-component and multifunctional; Platelet-rich plasma; Shell-core filament 3D scaffold; Triaxial bioprinting technology","","","","","","Foundation of Higher Education of Guangdong, (2020ZDZX2038); Guangdong Science and Technology Major Special Fund, (2019–252); Guangdong/Hong Kong Joint Foundation of Wuyi University, (2019WGALH11); Science Foundation for Young Research Group of Wuyi University, (2019td08)","This work was financially supported by the Guangdong Science and Technology Major Special Fund, China (No. 2019–252 ), the Foundation of Higher Education of Guangdong, China (No. 2020ZDZX2038 ), the Science Foundation for Young Research Group of Wuyi University (No. 2019td08 ) and the Guangdong/Hong Kong Joint Foundation of Wuyi University (No. 2019WGALH11 ).

But hitherto little has been reported on the 4D capabilities of 3D-printed recyclable ABS substrate-based sensors. This study reports the rheological (melt flow), mechanical (tensile), morphological (surface hardness, roughness (Ra), porosity, etc.), 3D printability, and radio frequency (RF) characteristics of primary recycled ABS substrate. Further, the 3D-printed ABS substrate samples were exposed to two different stimuli (chemical and thermal) for 10 cycles/stages to ascertain the effect on RF characteristics for ensuring 4D capabilities. The 3D-printed Bluetooth sensor has been designed for 2.45 GHz. The simulated results of the 3D-printed prototypes were verified experimentally using a vector network analyzer (VNA), which shows the appreciable response with a minimal frequency shift, thus ensuring the applicability of such sensors for Bluetooth applications. The percentage variation in the dielectric constant has been recorded to a maximum of 8% (in stage 9) and a minimum of 2% (in stage 6). Also, the dissipation factor of the substrate has been recorded to remain constant (~0.0045) indicating a factor of repeatability and hence the usability of such materials for 4D printing applications. Morphological analysis on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals that the Ra of the 3D-printed ABS substrate was significantly improved (50-19 nm), hence ensuring better performance of the fabricated sensors. © 2022, ASM International.","3D printing; acrylonitrile butadiene styrene; recyclability; ring resonator; thermoplastic; vector network analyzer","3D printers; Bluetooth; Butadiene; Radio waves; Reinforced plastics; Scanning electron microscopy; Styrene; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene; Mechanical; Radio frequency characteristics; Radiofrequencies; Recyclability; Recyclables; Ring resonator; Vector-network analyzers; Electric network analyzers","","","","","NITTTR Chandigarh","The authors are thankful to IKGPTU Jalandhar, Manufacturing Research Lab, Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana, and NITTTR Chandigarh for providing research facilities.","Thompson D.C., Tantot O., Jallageas H., Ponchak G.E., Tentzeris M.M., Papapolymerou J., Characterization of Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) Material and Transmission Lines on LCP Substrates from 30 to 110 GHz, IEEE Trans.

Typical LPBF surface features include layer-by-layer staircase edges, laser tracks, various degrees of balling, unfused/partially melted powder, spatter particles, and solidification chevrons. They present differently depending on being located on the component's top, side, up or down skins. Their spatial and amplitude features can also vary widely in magnitude depending on the alloy and process parameters involved. Although a significant body of work exists on characterizing LPBF surfaces, there is still little understanding of the cause-effect relationships they have with LPBF process parameters. Hence, there is limited capacity to tailor/optimize surface characteristics for specific standards/applications, such as fatigue performance, wear resistance, implant-bone biointegration, heat exchanger optimization, etc. Before the causal relationships can be explored, one must understand which LPBF characteristic feature or features are controlling a particular LPBF surface roughness. This work describes a new approach to the multiscale characterization and analysis of surfaces specific to LPBF. The method applies spatial and amplitude discriminators to partition LPBF features into separate topographies, enabling an assessment of their individual contribution to surface roughness. It involved systematically varying the cut-off wavelength over the entire spatial range of the surface and detecting discrete transitions in surface field parameters that identified a change in the dominant surface feature. The cut-off wavelengths where these transitions occurred were then used to partition the surface into separate topographies containing particular surface features. This enabled an independent assessment of their individual contribution to overall roughness. The method was demonstrated on LPBF top surfaces using five process parameter sets spanning from low to high energy density. It was successful in determining the segmentation cut-off wavelengths of each set, enabling an assessment of their individual contribution to overall surface roughness. The results indicate that this method has the potential to enable exploration of the causal relationships between process parameters and specific surface features as well as provide a basis for tailoring LPBF surfaces. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Cutoff wavelength; Laser powder bed fusion; Surface filtration; Surface roughness","3D printers; Heat resistance; Wear resistance; Causal relationships; Cutoff wavelengths; Fusion components; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Powder bed; Process parameters; Surface characteristics; Surface feature; Surface filtration; Surface roughness","","","","","National Institute of Standards; United States National Institute of Standards and Technology, (NIST-70NANB16H272, NIST-70NANB17H295, NIST-70NANB18H220); National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST","Funding text 1: The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Barton C.

The 3-D printing technique is stereolithography, so the printed parts are plastic-based. A two-step metallization process is followed: a premetallization with nickel spray to make the part conductive and a subsequent electroplating process, emphasizing the chemical compounds and quantities needed to improve the result obtained, as well as the metallization times and currents applied on the parts. In addition, manufacturing deviations are measured and compensated. The results obtained are compared with simulations and commercial waveguide sections. Measurements show S11 below-33 and-21 dB for WR-28 and WR-10, respectively. Measured average losses are around 1 dB/m for WR-28 and 4 dB/m for WR-10, which is equivalent to copper with an effective surface roughness lower than 0.4μm. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","3-D-printing; additive manufacturing; electroplating; millimeter-wave; stereolithography (SLA); waveguide","Additives; Copper; Electroplating; Fabrication; Metallizing; Millimeter waves; Reduction; Stereolithography; Surface roughness; Waveguides; 3-D printing; Attenuation; Electrochemical deposition; Electroplating process; Metallisation; Metallization process; Mm waves; Printing process; Printing techniques; Stereolithography; Electrochemical deposition","","","","","","","Sorrentino R., Peverini O.A., Additive manufacturing: A key enabling technology for next-generation microwave and millimeter-wave systems [point of view], Proc.

A machine learning (ML) framework based on sensitive features and continuous damage mechanics (CDM) herein is proposed to predict the fatigue life of AM-built parts. The sensitive features are extracted to blunt the disturbing effect of causality among the features. The CDM theory considering AM parameters is conducive to constructing a physics-informed ML model. This work employs support vector machines and random forests to predict the fatigue life of AM-built AlSi10Mg alloy. The results demonstrate that the physical knowledge-guided ML model using sensitive features exhibits better performance of fatigue life prediction. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Continuous damage mechanics;

However, many natural structures are still difficult to mimic due to their complex gradient designs. In this paper, a novel design strategy is proposed for generating multi-dimensional gradient gyroid structures, which have the ability to mimic complex gradient pore characteristics. The novel design strategy is based on the topological constants instead of thickness, cell size and porosity. Moreover, it adopted the interpolation function to bridge the gap between adjacent pore gradients. Five gradient gyroid structures from one-dimensional, two-dimensional to three-dimensional (1D, 2D to 3D) space were generated as examples using this design method. A numerical method is developed to assess the mechanical response of proposed structures incorporating the rate-dependent properties under varying impact loading velocity. Functionally graded metallic gyroid structures were fabricated using selective laser melting and its experimental results were used to validate the numerical model under both quasi-static and dynamic compression. Then the load-bearing capacity of these gradient gyroid structures under different loading velocities was investigated. According to the results from the numerical analysis, the gradient design of gyroid structures has a substantial impact on the deformation modes and load-bearing capacity. Gradient design in gyroid structures is capable of providing excellent specific energy absorption and demonstrates tremendous promise for managing deformation behaviors. 3D gradient design exhibits the best loading bearing capacity among 1D, 2D gradient ones and traditional triply periodic minimal surface structures (including gyroid, diamond, Primitive, F-Koch and IWP). The multidimensional gradient design strategy proposed in this study showed the ability to mathematically control the complex gradient pore characteristics, which can be applied to the design of functionally graded structures for efficient energy absorption also in modern composite structures. © 2022","Deformation modes; Dynamic loading; Energy absorption; Gradient design strategy; Triply periodic minimal surfaces","Bearing capacity; Deformation; Dynamic loads; Dynamics; Numerical methods; Structural design; Complex gradient; Deformation modes; Design strategies; Dynamic loadings; Gradient design strategy; Gradient pore; Gyroid structure; Novel design; Pore characteristics; Triply periodic minimal surfaces; Energy absorption","","","","","Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research, (2021B0301030001); National Key Laboratory Foundation of Science and Technology on Materials, (6142902210109); Space Utilization System of China Manned Space Engineering, (KJZ-YY-WCL03); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11902232, 51472188, 51521001); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities of the Central South University, (B13035); Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities of the Central South University","This work is supported by the Guangdong Major Project of Basic and Applied Basic Research ( 2021B0301030001 ), Project supported by the Space Utilization System of China Manned Space Engineering ( KJZ-YY-WCL03 ), National Key Laboratory Foundation of Science and Technology on Materials under Shock and Impact ( 6142902210109 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51472188, 11902232 and 51521001 ), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China and the “111″ Project (No. B13035 ).

In this study, we investigated the influence of the carbon content (0.04–2.5 mass%) on the porosity and microstructure of Co–27Cr–6Mo (mass%) alloys during atomization and electron-beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). Quantitative X-ray computed tomography clarified that the volume fraction of pores in the raw powders monotonically increased with the carbon content, as a potential effect of the significant reduction in the liquidus temperature. In contrast, the porosity evolution in the investigated alloys during EB-PBF under identical building conditions suggested an influence of carbon concentration that was distinct from that in the powder. These alloys exhibited negligible porosity fraction for 0.04 and 0.22 mass% and a maximum volume fraction (∼0.3 vol.%) at 2.0 mass%, followed by a remarkable reduction caused by further carbon addition. The porosity of the as-built alloys could be correlated to the solidification behavior varying with carbon concentration. The smoother and more flat solidification front during the cellular (0.04 and 0.22 mass%) and eutectic (2.5 mass%) solidification could effectively eliminate the gas bubbles from the melt pool, whereas the complicated morphology at the solid–liquid interfaces during the dendritic growth (1.5 and 2.0 mass%) hindered the pore elimination in the melt pool. Adding carbon significantly increased the Rockwell hardness of the as-built specimens, reaching a significantly high value of HRC59 at 2.5 mass% of carbon, primarily due to the formation of hard carbide precipitates. The obtained findings could be beneficial to reduce entrapped gas pores thereby contributing to the development of highly durable metal components. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Co–Cr–Mo alloys; Electron-beam powder bed fusion; Gas atomization; Porosity; Solidification microstructure","Alloys; Atomization; Carbides; Carbon; Computerized tomography; Electron beams; Microstructure; Morphology; Phase interfaces; Powder metals; Solidification; Volume fraction; % reductions; Carbon concentrations; Carbon content; CoCrMo alloy; Electron-beam; Electron-beam powder bed fusion; Gas atomization; Powder bed; Solidification behaviors; Solidification microstructures; Porosity","","","","","Indian National Science Academy, INSA; Tohoku University; Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (18H05455); Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University, (18G0417)","Funding text 1: This research was financially supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Area \u201CHigh Entropy Alloys\u201D [grant number 18H05455] and a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) [grant number 18H03834] from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).The authors express their gratitude to Issei Narita and Fuyuki Sakamoto (Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University) for their technical assistance.

In this study, a composite unit cell was designed by combining the positive Poisson's ratio (PPR) and negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) unit cells, inspired by the second-phase strengthening theory. The purpose was to increase the strength while maintaining the elastic modulus. All structures were successfully fabricated from Ti-6Al-4V via selective laser melting. The relative density is between 0.08 and 0.24, which falls within the optimal range for bone growth. Mechanical tests indicated that the center of the inclined rod fractured in a stepwise fracture mode, which was consistent with the predictions of the Johnson–Cook model. The elastic modulus ranged from 0.652 ± 0.016 to 5.172 ± 0.021 GPa, and the yield strength varied from 10.62 ± 0.112 to 87.158 ± 2.215 MPa. An improved Gibson–Ashby law was proposed to facilitate the design of gradient structures. When the re-entrant angle was 40°, a hybrid body-centered cubic NPR structure was formed, resulting in a significant improvement in the mechanical properties. Importantly, the yield strength of the proposed composite structures increased by 43.23%, and the compression strength increased by 44.70% under the same elastic modulus. The strengthening mechanism has been proven to apply to other bending-dominated structures. Overall, this imparts unprecedented mechanical performance to auxetic meta-biomaterials and provides insights into improving the reported porous structures. Statement of significance: Auxetic meta-biomaterials exhibit auxetic properties that can improve the contact between the bone-implant interface and reduce the risk of aseptic failure. To avoid the stress shielding effect, the elastic modulus has traditionally been decreased by increasing the porosity. However, the strength is simultaneously reduced. Therefore, a composite unit cell was proposed to increase strength rather than modulus by combining the positive and negative Poisson's ratio unit cells, inspired by the second-phase strengthening theory. We observed a 43.23% increase in the yield strength of the composite structure without increasing the elastic modulus. This strengthening mechanism has been proven to apply to other bending-dominated structures. Our approach provides insights into improving other bending-dominated structures and broadening their applications for bone implantation. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Auxetic meta-biomaterials; Bone implant; Elastic modulus; Second-phase strengthening; Strength","Alloys; Biocompatible Materials; Elastic Modulus; Humans; Lasers; Porosity; Titanium; Aluminum alloys; Biomechanics; Bone; Cells; Cytology; Melting; Metal implants; Poisson ratio; Porosity; Scaffolds (biology); Selective laser melting; Shielding; Structural design; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Vanadium alloys; Yield stress; alloy; biomaterial; titanium; Auxetic meta-biomaterial; Auxetics; Bone implant; Negative Poisson ratio; Second phase strengthening; Selective laser melting; Shielding effect; Strength; Stress shielding; Unit cells; Article; atmosphere; bone growth; degree of freedom; finite element analysis; fracture; human; hydrostatic pressure; implantation; mechanical test; mechanics; physiological stress; porosity; prediction; relative density; scanning electron microscopy; selective laser melting; theoretical study; three dimensional printing; topography; trabecular bone; x-ray computed tomography; Young modulus; chemistry; laser; Young modulus; Elastic moduli","","titanium, 7440-32-6; Alloys, ; Biocompatible Materials, ; Titanium, ","","","Optical Valley Science Research Project; WEHDZ, (2019001); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51971097, 52171238, U19A2085); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported financially by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52171238 , 51971097 , and U19A2085 ), the Optical Valley Science Research Project, WEHDZ (No. 2019001).

Deformation is one of the most important problems because it is directly related to the final depositing quality. The deformation of substrate is investigated during the DED process. Both finite element analysis and in situ measurement are used to analyze the deformations. The results show that substrate deformation increased quickly and decreased periodically in the additive manufacturing stage, then it tended to be stable during the cooling stage. The relationship among the deformation, temperature, stress and substrate thickness was analyzed. The results of simulation and experiment are very close, which will help to reduce the cost of numbers of experiments. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.","Additive manufacturing; Deformation; Directed energy deposition; Finite element method; Residual stress","3D printers; Additives; Deposition; Finite element method; Numerical methods; Substrates; Deposition efficiencies; Directed energy; Directed energy deposition; Energy depositions; High laser power; In-situ measurement; Inconel-718; Laser powders; Powder feeding; Power feeding; Deformation","","","","","National Key of Research and Development Plan: Research on common key technologies of clean cutting, (2019YFB2005401); Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province, (KYCX22_3626, SJCX22_1849); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2022M710060); Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (BK20210758); open fund for Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, (HGAMTL-2103)","This work was supported by the National Key of Research and Development Plan: Research on common key technologies of clean cutting (No. 2019YFB2005401), the Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (No. BK20210758), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Project (No. 2022M710060), the open fund for Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Advanced Manufacturing Technology (HGAMTL-2103), and Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (Nos.

But, there was a lack of in-depth study in the nano-level mechanical properties of the Scalmalloy. So, the prime novelty of this research work is to examine the nano-level mechanical behavior with respect to nano-level precipitations due to Sc-Zr addition. In this work, the L-PBFed Scalmalloy was examined for the irregularities and the grain distributions using Optical Microscopy (OM) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) with Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis. The formation of Al3Sc precipitates was identified using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. Further, the influence of precipitates on the grain orientation was evaluated through Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) analysis. The nano-hardness and nano-wear testing was performed on the L-PBFed Scalmalloy. The maximum nano-hardness and reduced modulus of 2.19 GPa and 87.50 GPa was obtained from the average of 400 indentations. The nano-hardness mapping and reduced modulus mapping proved the homogenous dispersion of the precipitation. From the topographic wear tracks in the nano-wear analysis, the average worn-out height of 250.89 nm was observed and the fluctuation in the co-efficient of friction (CoF) confirms the formation of ceramic phase Al3Sc precipitates which resists the worn-out height. Tensile strength of the L-PBFed Scalmalloy was evaluated based on the 3 strain rates (3.3 × 10−5, 1.6 × 10−5 and 2 × 10−4 s−1) and the outcome shows that the Scalmalloy exhibits negative strain rate and serration caused by Portevin-Le Chatelier effect on the Al3Sc precipitates and the Mg content. © 2022","Al<sub>3</sub>Sc precipitates; Laser-powder bed fusion; Melt pool formation; Precipitate free zone; Scalmalloy; Strain rate analysis","Aluminum alloys; Aluminum corrosion; Corrosion resistance; Enamels; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Field emission microscopes; Hardness; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Mapping; Scandium alloys; Scanning electron microscopy; Strain rate; Tensile strength; Wear of materials; Zircaloy; Al3sc precipitate; Laser powders; Laser-powder bed fusion; Melt pool; Melt pool formation; Pool formation; Powder bed; Precipitate free zones; Precipitate-free zones; Rate analysis; Scalmalloy; Strain rate analyse; Strain-rates; Binary alloys","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST","We are grateful for the support from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan for providing the financial support.","Rashia Begum S., Saravana Kumar M., Pruncu C.I., Vasumathi M., Harikrishnan P., Optimization and fabrication of customized scaffold using additive manufacturing to match the property of human bone, J.

Therefore, we considered optimizing CT protocols to reduce radiation and organ doses during head, chest, abdominal, and pelvic CT examinations. For establishing institutional diagnostic reference levels as a benchmark to correlate with national diagnostic reference levels (NDRLs) in KSA conforming to international guidelines for radiation exposure, 3000 adult-patients underwent imaging of organs. Dose parameters were obtained using Monte Carlo software and adjusted using the Siemens Teamplay™ software. CTDIvol, DLP, and effective dose were 40.67 ± 3.8, 757 ± 63.2, and 1.74 ± 0.19, for head; 14.9 ± 1.38, 547 ± 42.9, and 7.27 ± 0.95 for chest; and 16.84 ± 1.45, 658 ± 53.4, and 10.2 ± 0.66 for abdomen/pelvis, respectively. The NDRL post-optimization comparison showed adequate CT exposure. Head CT parameters required additional optimization to match the NDRL. Therefore, calculations were repeated to assess radiation doses. In conclusion, doses could be substantially minimized by selecting parameters per clinical indication of the study, patient size, and examined body region. Additional dose reduction to superficial organs requires a shielding material. © 2022 by the authors.","achievable dose; computed tomography; exposure; ionizing radiation; organ dose","","","","","","","","Miglioretti D.L., Johnson E., Williams A., Greenlee R.T., Weinmann S., Solberg L.I., Feigelson H.S., Roblin D., Flynn M.J., Vanneman N., Et al., The use of computed tomography in pediatrics and the associated radiation exposure and estimated cancer risk, JAMA Pediatr, 167, pp. 700-707, (2013); Journy N., Ancelet S., Rehel J.-L., Mezzarobba M., Aubert B., Laurier D., Bernier M.-O., Predicted cancer risks induced by computed tomography examinations during childhood, by a quantitative risk assessment approach, Radiat.

Tissue engineering scaffolds with favorable mechanical strength and excellent bone regenerative ability/angiogenic properties are recognized as promising platforms for bone defects. Various osteoinductive/angiogenic growth factors have been incorporated into scaffolds to enhance bone formation with the required vascularization. However, the instability and ease of inactivation of growth factors under certain physiological conditions limits their effectiveness. In the present study, a bifunctional laponite (LAP) with potent ability to induce both osteogenesis and angiogenesis was incorporated into poly(lactide-coglycolide)/β-tricalcium phosphate (PLGA/β-TCP) composite to form a porous scaffold through micro extrusion-based cryogenic three-dimensional printing. The hierarchically porous PLGA/β-TCP/LAP composite scaffold exhibited favorable initial mechanical strength and displayed a promoted effect towards cell adhesion of rat bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells. Enhanced in vitro angiogenesis and osteogenesis were simultaneously achieved due to the proangiogenic and osteoinductive ions released from LAP. Furthermore, the PLGA/β-TCP/LAP scaffold promoted the generation of type H vessel and bony regeneration in vivo. Overall, the impartment of inorganic LAP into 3D printed PLGA/β-TCP scaffold provides a simple and efficient way to realize the treatment of critical-sized bone defects via improved angiogenesis and osteogenesis. © 2022","Angiogenesis; Bone defect; Bone regeneration; Cryogenic 3D printing; Silicate nanoclay","Bone; Cell adhesion; Cell culture; Cryogenics; Defects; Endothelial cells; Nanocomposites; Scaffolds (biology); Silicates; Stem cells; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Angiogenesis; Bone defect; Bone regeneration; Cryogenic 3d printing; Laponites; Nano clays; Silicate nanoclay; β-TCP; 3D printers","","","","","Guangxi Science and Technology Program, (198); Key Science and Technology Project of Social Development, (20211800904542); Special Program of Guangdong Frontier and Key Technological Innovation, (2015B010125006); Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of Jilin Province, (20212111, 20221263); Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of Jilin Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52173148, 81772428, 82072411); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Southern Medical University, SMU, (LC2016ZD032); Southern Medical University, SMU; Department of Education of Guangdong Province, DEGP, (2021ZDZX2014); Department of Education of Guangdong Province, DEGP","This work were partly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.81772428, 82072411, 52173148); Guangxi Science and Technology Program (Guike Jizi [2020] No. 198); The “Clinical Research Initiative” of Southern Medical University (No. LC2016ZD032); Key Science and Technology Project of Social Development of Dongguan, China (20211800904542); Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of Guangdong Province, China(NO. 20212111, 20221263)；Special Program of Guangdong Frontier and Key Technological Innovation (No. 2015B010125006); Department of Education of Guangdong Province, China (2021ZDZX2014).

The half-ellipsoid lens is 3-D printed using stereolithography technology. The antenna prototype is capable of selecting the main beam between 16 different directions with a gain ranging from 14 to 16 dBi and a half-power beamwidth of 14°-18°. The measurements carried out in an anechoic chamber show good agreement with numerical simulations. The presented prototype shows that by employing 3-D printing technologies existing antennas can be easily and inexpensively converted to switched-beam or multibeam solutions.  © 2002-2011 IEEE.","3-D printing; additive manufacturing; CubeSat; fifth-generation (5G) communication; Internet-of-Things; millimeter-wave antenna; passive multibeam antennas; reconfi-gurable antennas; switched-beam antennas","5G mobile communication systems; Antenna arrays; Internet of things; Latexes; Lens antennas; Microstrip antennas; Millimeter waves; MIMO systems; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Cubesat; Fifth-generation (5 g) communication; Gain; Microstrip antenna array; Millimeter-wave antennas; Multi-beam antennas; Passive multi-beam antenna; Reconfigurable antenna; Switched beam antennas; 3D printers","","","","","","","Akyildiz I.F., Kak A., Nie S., 6G and beyond: The future of wireless communications systems, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 133995-134030, (2020); Rahmat-Samii Y., Manohar V., Kovitz J.M., For satellites, think small, dream big: A review of recent antenna developments for CubeSats, IEEE Antennas Propag.

NAS has been historically calculated as the average slope (linear regression) of the net ankle moment versus ankle angle during discrete phases of stance. However, recent work has shown that NAS is nonlinear during the stance phase. Specifically, during the loading phase of stance (∼10 to 60% of total stance), plantarflexion moment increases at an accelerating rate compared to dorsiflexion angle. Updated models have been developed to better capture this inherent nonlinearity. One type of model called bi-linear NAS (BL-NAS) divides the loading phase of stance into two subphases, called early loading (EL) and late loading (LL) NAS. Two papers, written by Crenna and Frigo (2011, ""Dynamics of the Ankle Joint Analyzed Through Moment-Angle Loops During Human Walking: Gender and Age Effects,"" Hum. Mov. Sci., 30(6), pp. 1185-1198) and Shamaei et al. (2013, ""Estimation of Quasi-Stiffness and Propulsive Work of the Human Ankle in the Stance Phase of Walking,"" PLoS One, 8(3), p. e59935), outline different BL-NAS models. Both models fit measured data better (lower root-mean-squared error (RMSE)) than standard single linear NAS (SL-NAS) models but have not been widely adopted, possibly because of methodological discrepancies and lack of applicability to physical devices at the time. This paper compares and contrasts these existing BL-NAS models and translates those findings to possible orthotic device designs. Results showed that both BL-NAS models had lower RMSE than SL-NAS, EL-NAS was not significantly different across walking speeds, and LL-NAS increased significantly at faster walking speeds. These improved models of NAS much better approximate natural human movement than commonly used SL-NAS models, and thus provide a basis to design ankle-foot devices with multiple stiffness properties to emulate and facilitate natural human motion.

The device expands upon the traditional tapered coaxial balun by allowing for variations of both the inner and outer conductor radii in addition to the slot width. This multi-tapered approach provides additional design freedoms useful for realizing a wide range of impedance ratios, satisfying fixed geometrical constraints, and reducing transmission losses. A multimaterial additive manufacturing (AM) approach is described for fabricating the balun's complex 3-D geometry. Experimental validation was conducted within the Ku -band for printed back-to-back baluns and an integrated antenna feed that combined a printed connector, a multi-tapered coaxial balun, and a spiral antenna. Simulated and measured results showed good performance over the frequency band of interest. © 2011-2012 IEEE.","3-D printing; additive manufacturing (AM); antenna feed; balun; impedance transformer","Antenna feeders; Geometry; Microstrip antennas; Microwave antennas; Spiral antennas; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Antenna feeds; Balun; Baluns; Conductor; Impedance; Impedance transformers; Power transmission lines; Wide-band; 3D printers","","","","","","","Yoon Y.J., Et al., Design and characterization of multilayer spiral transmission-line baluns, IEEE Trans.

In this work, two blanket components with inner-channeled structure were fabricated with 9Cr reduced activation ferritic/martensitic steel by WAAM. It was found that Ti reacted with oxygen to form TiO2 particles is situ in the melt pool of 9Cr-RAFMs with 0.5% addition of Ti. These high melting point particles refined the grain size by heterogeneous nucleation. The microstructures of 9Cr-RAFMs and 9Cr-RAFMs-0.5Ti were studied by SEM, EBSD and TEM. In addition, their mechanical properties at different temperatures were obtained. An increase in the mechanical strength of as-built9Cr-RAFMs-0.5Ti was observed due to the fine grain structure, high dislocation density and high number density of oxide dispersions. © 2022","Microalloying Ti; RAFMs; Tensile property; Wire and arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Grain size and shape; Microstructure; Nucleation; Titanium; Titanium dioxide; Wire; Complexes structure; Large-scales; Low-costs; Manufacturing IS; Melt pool; Microalloying ti; Microstructures and mechanical properties; RAFM; Reduced-activation ferritic/martensitic steels; Wire and arc additive manufacturing; Microalloying","","","","","Huazhong University of Science and Technology, HUST, (2020kfyXJJS086); Huazhong University of Science and Technology, HUST; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Magnetic Confinement Fusion Program of China, (2018YFE0306104); National Magnetic Confinement Fusion Program of China","The authors would like to gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the National Magnetic Confinement Fusion Science Programs (with Grant No. 2018YFE0306104 ).

External feeding of deposition powder and external pre-heating of substrate generate good consolidation of Al alloy 6061 generating 383 °C as max. temperature which is much below its melting point. Full factorial 27 experiments were conducted on an indigenously developed experimental FSPAM apparatus by varying tool rotational speed and substrate traverse speed at 3 levels each and using 3 geometrical features on tool bottom (i.e., flat bottom, radially grooved, and circumferentially and radially grooved). Depositions have onion rings for all tool geometries, and they move towards advancing side than retreating side giving rough surface with smoother edge to former and smoother surface with rough edge to latter. GRA identified tool rotational speed of 1200 rpm, substrate traverse speed of 25 mm/min, and circumferentially and radially grooved tool as optimum FSPAM process parameters and optimum deposition was obtained using these parameters. Microstructure study of the optimum deposition showed substantial grain refinement with an average sub-grain size of 1.6 μm which is attributed to dynamic recrystallization. It consists of splat boundaries due to severe plastic deformation. It is defect-free with absence of voids or porosities and having maximum height and arithmetical average roughness as 8.4 µm and 2.5 µm respectively. EDS revealed uniform distribution of all the major alloying elements of Al 6061 powder throughout the optimum deposition. XRD revealed retention of all the phases of the Al 6061 powder in the optimum deposition. Geometrical features on tool bottom led to better surface finish but deteriorated microhardness of deposition. ANOVA of grey relational grades revealed that tool rotational speed is the most dominant parameter affecting surface quality and surface integrity of the deposition. This study proves FSPAM to be a viable alternative to fusion-based additive manufacturing processes particularly for aluminum alloys.

Considering that scaffolds play a fundamental role in many tissue engineering strategies, it would be interesting to count with an internationally accepted set of geometries, acting as a library of lattices, porous materials and scaffolding structures, which could be employed for comparative purposes among materials and manufacturing technologies under development. To this end, an open-source library of tissue engineering scaffolds has been implemented. This library stands out for providing a comprehensive collection of scaffolds blueprints, designed considering the specific features of most additive manufacturing technologies applicable to tissue engineering and biofabrication. Besides, the library has been developed focusing on FAIR data principles along the development, for promoting: Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability. The scaffolds are shared as open-source medical devices with the necessary documentation for facilitating their application. Similar initiatives may be synergically integrated towards an ISO standard on tissue engineering scaffolds. © 2022 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; Biofabrication; Bioinspiration and biomimetics; Biomaterials; FAIR data principles; Open-source medical devices; Tissue engineering; Virtual and rapid prototyping","Additives; Biomimetics; Digital libraries; ISO Standards; Open systems; Porous materials; Reusability; Scaffolds (biology); Tissue; Bio-inspiration; Biofabrication; Bioinspiration and biomimetic; FAIR data principle; Medical Devices; Open-source; Open-source medical device; Rapid-prototyping; Tissue engineering scaffold; Tissues engineerings; 3D printers","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Horizon 2020, (953134)","Funding text 1: Finally, reusability is enabled thanks to the OS library being shared through a Creative Commons license ( https://creativecommons.org/ ).

Due to the advantages of high efficiency, low cost, and simple process requirements, we make the first attempt to introduce additive manufacturing with perovskite quantum dots (QDs) to fabricate a novel linear encoder, which is named quantum dot encoder. First, to better print coding patterns, a new printing ink is created by combining perovskite quantum dots with polycaprolactone (PCL). Then, an innovative coding pattern is printed on the glass substrate by the near-field direct writing with the new ink, which can achieve an actively produced optical signal directly instead of the passively produced optical signal in traditional optical encoders. Finally, a new measurement system for quantum dot encoder is established and an image processing method is elaborately designed to implement the displacement measurement. Simulations indicate that the quantum dot encoder can avoid the thermal deformation caused by the overheated light source, which is beneficial for the decoding precision. Measurement results indicate that the designed quantum dot encoder with a low-speed motion platform and a low-frame charge coupled device (CCD) can achieve a fair measurement precision at a reasonable displacement velocity, which validates our innovative approach for the fabrication of the linear encoder by means of additive manufacturing with perovskite quantum dots.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Displacement encoder; measurement; near-field direct writing; perovskite quantum dots (QDs)","3D printers; Displacement measurement; Fabrication; Image processing; Ink jet printing; Light sources; Nanocrystals; Optical data processing; Perovskite; Photopolymerization; Semiconductor quantum dots; Signal encoding; Direct-writing; Displacement encoder; Grating; Near fields; Near-field direct writing; Optical device fabrication; Optical encoder; Perovskite quantum dot; Quantum dot; Writing; Substrates","","","","","","","Zhu K., Et al., The development of integrated circuits based on twodimensional materials, Nature Electron., 4, 11, pp. 775-785, (2021); Shang C., Et al., Perspectives on advances in quantum dot lasers and integration with Si photonic integrated circuits, ACS Photon., 8, 9, pp. 2555-2566, (2021); Gupta S., Navaraj W.T., Lorenzelli L., Dahiya R., Ultra-thin chips for high-performance flexible electronics, NPJ Flexible Electron., 2, 1, pp. 1-17, (2018); Orji N.G., Et al., Metrology for the next generation of semiconductor devices, Nature Electron., 1, 10, pp. 532-547, (2018); Liu C.-H., Jywe W.-Y., Jeng Y.-R., Hsu T.-H., Li Y.-T., Design and control of a long-traveling nano-positioning stage, Precis.

Due to limitation in size and shape, the heat dispersion of some key parts cannot meet the working requirements of equipment. To address failure in forming suspension structure directly and easy blockage of channels in additive manufacturing, this study proposed a research method that realized channel processing by using high-frequency induction as heat source and adding embedded pipe into melt deposition shaping. A multi-physical-field coupling finite element simulation model was constructed and an induction cladding experimental platform of shaftclass parts with embedded pipe was built. The high-frequency induction cladding manufacturing technology was studied from perspectives of macroscopic morphology and microstructure, element diffusion, temperature field distribution, and induction cladding technology of embedded tube. Results demonstrated that the maximum deformation rates of outer diameter and inner diameter of embedded pipe were 4.98% and 1.44%, respectively. The embedded pipe was influenced by molten pool and high-temperature cladding layer slightly, thus achieving good shaping quality. Therefore, the proposed manufacturing technology was feasible and it could solve technological bottleneck of insufficient heat dispersion capacity of equipment. Research conclusions can provide theoretical and technological supports to applications of additive manufacturing technology based on cooling channels and induction melting deposition to industrial production. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Embedded pipe; Induction cladding; Manufacturing technology; Shaftclass parts","3D printers; Additives; Cladding (coating); Industrial research; Morphology; Simulation platform; Stainless steel; Cooling channels; Embedded pipe; Embeddings; Heat dispersions; High frequency induction cladding; Induction cladding; Manufacturing technologies; Shaftclass part; Size and shape; Steel capillary; Dispersions","","","","","Petro-China Innovation Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, NNSF, NSF, NSFC, (51175515); PetroChina Innovation Foundation, (2017D-5007–0307); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, (ZR2020ME162); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (18CX05004A)","This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51175515), Petro-China Innovation Foundation (Grant 2017D-5007–0307), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 18CX05004A), and Natural Science Foundation of Shangdong Provincial (ZR2020ME162).

A major issue in in-situ alloying is the macro-segregation of alloying elements, that results in chemical inhomogeneity. The precise control of composition is one of the most important steps in any effective in-situ alloying process. In this study, a mesoscale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for simulating single-tracks is developed to advance the in-depth understanding of in-situ alloying of dissimilar metals. Surface tension and recoil pressure driven flows at the free surface, rapid phase change, laser reflections, and other physical phenomena affecting the LPBF process have all been examined. Species conservation is used to trace the mixing of different metals. Simulations are performed by melting a layer of Al powder on a Cu substrate, and the impact of recoil pressure and Marangoni convection driven flows on Al-Cu mixing was addressed. The homogeneity of the simulated track is quantified by defining a mixing index. The effect of different laser energy densities and remelting on the homogeneity of the deposited track is investigated. Numerically, it was observed that the high thermal conductivity of both metals results in a sharp and short melt pool, and rapid solidification of such a melt pool generates a heterogeneous concentration dispersion. At high energy density, a low mixing index value is observed, indicating improved homogeneity in the deposited track. Furthermore, remelted tracks have a low mixing index value, indicating that remelting is an effective strategy for improving homogeneity. This study provides fundamental insights on the mixing of dissimilar metals and aims to support future research activities on the design and development of new alloys using LPBF process. © 2022 The Authors","Alloy homogeneity; In situ alloying; LPBF; Ray tracing; Remelting; Simulation","Alloying elements; Binary alloys; Computational fluid dynamics; Conservation; Copper; Powder metals; Trace elements; Alloy homogeneity; Fusion process; In situ alloying; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Mixing index; New alloys; Powder bed; Recoil pressure; Simulation; Alloying","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (MA 3333/13-1); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the German Science Foundation under the Leibniz Program (Grant MA 3333/13-1 ).

PIL is an approach for nongradient descent learning, and its main advantage is the lower computational cost and fast learning procedure, which is especially relevant in the edge computing research field. However, PIL is mostly applied to a deterministic learning problem, while in the real world, the greatest case that is of concern is the uncertainty learning problem. In this work, under the framework of the synergetic learning system (SLS), we introduce an approximated synergetic learning scheme, which can transform uncertainty learning into deterministic learning. We call this new learning framework the Bayesian PIL, and the advantages are also demonstrated in this work.  © 2013 IEEE.","Bayesian; feedforward neural networks; mixture priors; pseudoinverse learners (PILs); synergetic learning","Algorithms; Bayes Theorem; Neural Networks, Computer; Uncertainty; Bayesian networks; Feedforward neural networks; Inverse problems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Uncertainty analysis; Bayes method; Bayesian; Computational modelling; Mixture priors; Modeling; Neural-networks; Pseudo-inverses; Pseudoinverse learner; Synergetic learning; Synergetics; Task analysis; Uncertainty; algorithm; Bayes theorem; uncertainty; Probabilistic logics","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62006020); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (U2031136); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018AAA0100203)","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2018AAA0100203; in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62006020; and in part by the Joint Research Fund in Astronomy under cooperative agreement between the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) under Grant U2031136","Ghahramani Z., Bayesian non-parametrics and the probabilistic approach to modelling, Philos.

B-spline parameterization is used to represent the structural density field together with Heaviside projection and Boolean operation. Two constraints and a novel filtering scheme relevant to AM are presented:The overhang angle constraint constructed based on the density gradient with build direction included as design variables.The boundary gradient constraint constructed for possible V-shaped cross-section features of 3D problems in various build directions.The gradient filtering scheme adopted to eliminate the V-shaped areas by computing the global overhang angle at all structural boundaries. Representative 2D and 3D problems are dealt with to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Additive manufacturing; B-spline; Build direction; Overhang; Self-supporting; Topology optimization","Fuel additives; Interpolation; Parameterization; Shape optimization; Structural optimization; Topology; B splines; Build direction; Density methods; Filtering schemes; Overhang; Parameterized; Self-supporting; Simultaneous optimization; Structural topologies; Topology optimisation; 3D printers","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12032018, 12220101002)","This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 12032018, 12220101002).

The distance between DFs is optimized for suppressing reflection and insertion losses, and the asymmetric distribution of DFs is designed to obtain a low profile. The experimental data demonstrate a 3-dB passband of 8.3%, 8.8%, and 9.7% centered at 74, 84, and 94 GHz, respectively, for the proposed FDM, showing a good match with the simulation.

Degradation assessment optimization is key to reduce costs in SL market not only at the repurposing stage, but also during SL lifetime. As an indicator of the ageing condition of the batteries, state of health (SOH) is currently a major research topic, and its estimation has emerged as an alternative to traditional characterization tests. In an initial stage, all SOH estimation methods require the extraction of health indicators (HIs), which influence algorithm complexity and on-board implementation. Nevertheless, a literature gap has been identified in the assessment of HIs for reused Li-ion batteries. This contribution targets this issue by analysing 58 HIs obtained from incremental capacity analysis, partial charging, constant current and constant voltage stage, and internal resistance. Six Nissan Leaf SL modules were aged under extended cycling testing, covering a SOH range from 71.2 % to 24.4 %. Results show that the best HI at the repurposing stage was obtained through incremental capacity analysis, with 0.2 % of RMSE. During all SL use, partial charge is found to be the best method, with less than 2.0 % of RMSE. SOH is also estimated using the best HI and different algorithms. Linear regression is found to overcome more complex options with similar estimation accuracy and significantly lower computation times. Hence, the importance of analysing and selecting a good SL HI is highlighted, given that this made it possible to obtain accurate SOH estimation results with a simple algorithm. © 2022 The Authors","Ageing; Health indicator; Lithium-ion batteries; Second-life batteries; State of health estimation","Battery management systems; Computational complexity; Health; Ions; Lithium compounds; Capacity analysis; Degradation assessment; Economic viability; Health indicators; Indicator selections; Repurposing; Second Life; Second life batteries; State of health; State of health estimation; Lithium-ion batteries","","","","","Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI; Universidad Pública de Navarra, UPNA; STARDUST; Government of Navarre; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (774094); Horizon 2020, (0011-1411-2022-000039)","This work is part of the projects PID2019-111262RB-I00 , funded by MCIN / AEI /10.13039/501100011033/, STARDUST ( 774094 ), funded by European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme , HYBPLANT ( 0011-1411-2022-000039 ), funded by Government of Navarre , and a Ph.D. scholarship, also funded by Government of Navarre .

The design involves a U-Shaped slot, a rectangular shaped microstrip patched and two annular concentric slots. Current distribution in the surface undergoes modification by introducing three meanders sleeved in the ground plane leading to improvement of bandwidth. Coral Reefs Optimization integrated with Substrate Layer (CRO-SL) algorithm is utilized for optimizing the meanders, the dual circular slots and the U-shaped slot. The multi optimization method is utilized for this meta-heuristic population based approach which is a type of ensemble algorithm which considers various search operators in the same algorithm. In this work, a robust textile antenna is optimized using CRO-SL algorithm which operates at the frequency band of both LTE and 5G range. The process of optimization precedes by a fitness function guiding the CRO-SL, generated by means of antenna simulation through hybridizing with CST simulation software such that electromagnetic analysis is performed in the high frequency range. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Coral Reef Optimization;

Through fault tree analysis of the electronically controlled air suspension (ECAS) system and considering the correlation between the duty cycle and flow rate of the air spring solenoid valve, the fault model of the solenoid valve is constructed, and the fault diagnosis design method of the ECAS system solenoid valve based on multiple extended Kalman filter banks (EKFs) is proposed. An adaptive threshold is used to realize fault diagnosis, and active fault-tolerant control is carried out based on an analytical model. The real controller based on d2p rapid prototyping technology and the vehicle model based on AMESim are further verified on the hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) simulation test platform and compared with the pure simulation results. The test results show that the fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control algorithm can work normally in the actual controller, and can effectively realize the fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control of the actuator in the vehicle ECAS system. © 2022 by the authors.","electronically controlled air suspension; extended Kalman filter bank; fault diagnosis; fault-tolerant control; solenoid valve","Active suspension systems; Actuators; Automobile suspensions; Controllers; Electric fault currents; Fault detection; Fault tolerance; Fault tolerant computer systems; Fault tree analysis; Filter banks; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Simulation platform; Solenoids; Air suspension; Air suspension systems; Bleedings; Electronically controled air suspension; Extended kalman filter bank; Faults diagnosis; Faults tolerant controls; Filters bank; Model-based fault diagnosis; Vehicle body; Solenoid valves","","","","",", (PTDC/CCI-BIO/29266/2017); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51875256)","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51875256).","Yu Z., Deng Y., Zhang Z., Zhou T., Control for car ride comfort based on electronic-controlled air suspension, Tract.

The laminated structures had alternating soft and hard lamellae, and they imparted significant anisotropy to the composites. The composites had the highest bending strength when the loading plane was parallel to the lamellar orientation, and they showed the highest toughness when the loading plane was perpendicular to the lamellae and their stacking direction. Furthermore, ductile fracture characteristics were observed in both these cases, while brittle fracture characteristics were apparent when the loading plane was perpendicular to the lamellae but parallel to their stacking direction. The fracture behavior of the composites was analyzed on the basis of in situ observations of crack initiation and propagation. The toughening was mainly caused by internal and external processes such as plastic deformation of the ductile copper layer, crack deflection, ligament bridging, and multiple cracking. Overall, this work presents a simple, economical, and scalable route based on the concept of near-net shaping and a three-dimensional-printing technique for the preparation of ceramic/metal composites with desired structures. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Ceramic/metal composite; Direct ink writing; Laminated structure; Orientation; Pressureless infiltration","3D printers; Bending strength; Chromium compounds; Cracks; Ductile fracture; Fracture mechanics; Laminating; Loading; Ceramic metal composites; Direct ink writing; Fracture characteristics; High toughness; Lamellar orientations; Laminated structures; Net-shaping; Orientation; Pressureless infiltration; Stackings; Laminated composites","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (52071155)","This work is partly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52071155 ).

Additionally, these models should emphasise the primary breakage properties of the particles on the models rather than breakage in test devices that introduce substantial secondary fragmentation events. This work explores the use of the Short Impact Load Cell (SILC) test to investigate the mechanical properties of fabricated 3D-printed (3DP) specimens of single and binary mineral composition, i.e., iron oxide, silica, and layered specimens with both minerals. The fabricated quasi-identical specimens are useful to explore the repeatability and contrast of controlled additively manufactured 3DP specimens and the SILC testing performance. The fracture characteristics of printed quasi-identical specimens were observed using an ultra-high-speed digital camera. The study showed that the specimen properties, such as tensile strength and fracture energy are strongly influenced by the number of beds, bed thickness, and mineral composition. The force–deformation as well as force–time profiles and specimen fragmentation are studied to understand better the variability of the results and the specimen's physical response to a single impact. The contour of force–time profiles allows for interpretations of how the striker contacts the specimen and to infer the crack initiation and fracture propagation through beds of brittle or ductile material. The use of hierarchical clusters facilitates the analysis as they enhance contrasts and give more insight into breakage and fragmentation, which is worthwhile investigating for natural rocks in the future. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3D-printed; Fragmentation; Hierarchical cluster analysis; Impact breakage; Mineral composition; Texture","3D printers; Cluster analysis; Deformation; Fracture; Hierarchical systems; Iron oxides; Minerals; Silica; Tensile strength; 3d-printed; Force deformation; Fragmentation; Hierarchical cluster analysis; Impact breakages; Impact loads; Load cells; Mineral composition; Mineral processing; Property; Textures","","","","","Australian Research Council, ARC, (CE200100009); University of Queensland, UQ, (2019003181)","The authors acknowledge the funding support from the UQ Early Career, grant number 2019003181 as well as the Australian Research Council for the ARC Centre of Excellence for Enabling Eco-Efficient Beneficiation of Minerals, grant number CE200100009.

We utilised an adapted SC configuration framework to develop embedded case studies across the Aerospace, Automotive and Power Generation industries. The sample included fifteen companies deploying metal AM across three SC tiers. Using an abductive logic, our findings reveal that the complexity and dependency-reduction potential of AM depends on economic, industry, geographical, organisational and technological factors. We developed a conceptual framework for AM SC configuration and four propositions, which provide further insights into the interplay between SC complexities, dependencies and competitiveness. By utilising RDT, we contribute to the AM SC configuration literature by highlighting the mediating role that dependencies play in achieving competitiveness, as well as strategies adopted by firms to mitigate uncertainty. We also highlight the interplay between ‘relationship and governance’ and three other SC configuration dimensions in relation to competitiveness. Insights into the changing state of complexities and dependencies identified in this study could also support managerial decisions in AM SC design. © 2022 The Authors","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Distributed manufacturing; Resource dependence; supply chain complexity; Supply chain configuration","Additives; Competition; Supply chains; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Automotives; Case-studies; Distributed manufacturing; Metal additives; Power generation industries; Resource dependences; Supply chain complexity; Supply chain configuration; 3D printers","","","","","UK-India Education and Research Initiative, UKIERI; Ministry of Education, India, MoE","The authors wish to acknowledge that some aspects this research was carried out as part of the UKIERI SPARC Support Programme (code P730) funded by the MHRD, India .

To design aluminum alloy with low hot cracking tendency and is suitable for laser additive manufacturing, an aluminum‑zinc‑magnesium‑scandium (Al-Zn-Mg-Sc) system is proposed in this study. A theoretical model is used to predict the hot cracking susceptibility of this system. The optimized alloy composition is Al-6.5Zn-2.2 Mg-0.4Sc and its formability during laser melting deposition (LMD) is then investigated. An anisotropic microstructure is observed in the alloy: columnar grains with a [001]//Z texture in the building plane and equiaxed grains in the scanning plane. Pores are the main metallurgical processing defects, but a few hot cracks can be seen in the laser melted (Al-Zn-Mg-Sc) alloy. The mechanical properties can be significantly improved through heat treatment: the ultimate tensile strength of the alloy is increased from 258.7 MPa to 390.3 MPa, and elongation of the alloy is increased from 13.1% to 29.6% after solution and aging treatments, thus indicating that the alloy has good plasticity. © 2022","Al-Zn-mg-Sc alloy; Hot cracking; Laser melting deposition; Mechanical properties; Microstructure","Additives; Cracks; Deposition; Formability; Heat treatment; Magnesium alloys; Melting; Scandium alloys; Selective laser melting; Tensile strength; Ternary alloys; Textures; Zinc alloys; Al-Zn-Mg; Al-zn-mg-sc alloy; Aluminium-zinc; Composition design; Cracking susceptibility; Hot-cracking; Laser additive manufacturing; Laser melting deposition; Plastics processing; SC alloys; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Hunan Key R&D Plan, (2021GK2009); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (U21B2073); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars, (2020JJ2046); National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars; Changchun Science and Technology Planning Project","The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support of the Hunan Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars ( 2020JJ2046 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China ( U21B2073 ), Hunan Key R&D Plan ( 2021GK2009 ) and Ganzhou Science and Technology Planning Project (Grant no.

The cold metal transfer (CMT), low spatter control (LSC) and pulsed synergic (PS) current deposition modes were compared. Similar deposition strategy was employed in order to attempt to evaluate the influence of energy input on geometrical and mechanical properties of the deposits. To evaluate the mechanical properties of the deposits, hardness and tensile tests were carried out. Microstructures were analysed in optical microscope. As a result of the intrinsic characteristics of each current waveform and adjustments of the heat source used to perform the deposits, the heat input value was similar for CMT and PS mode and lower for the LSC mode. The CMT deposit was the tallest and widest. Temperatures were higher using the PS deposition mode. The hardness values for all deposits were higher than the usual ones for this tool steel. The microstructure was composed by hard phases, and the precipitates at grain boundaries were responsible for the brittle fracture observed in tensile specimens. © 2022, International Institute of Welding.","AISI H13 Steel; Current waveform; Mechanical properties; WAAM deposition mode; Wire arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Grain boundaries; Hardness; Microstructure; Tensile testing; Tool steel; Tools; 'current; AISI H13 steel; Cold metal transfers; Current waveform; Deposition modes; Waveforms; Wire arc; Wire arc additive manufacturing; Wire arc additive manufacturing deposition mode; Deposits","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (721267); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES, (88881.189938/2018-01)","Funding text 1: The author William Hackenhaar would like to acknowledge the support by the Brazilian research agency, Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)—PDSE [88881.189938/2018-01]. ; Funding text 2: This research has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement n° 721267 though ManuNet initiative—RetroFix project.
