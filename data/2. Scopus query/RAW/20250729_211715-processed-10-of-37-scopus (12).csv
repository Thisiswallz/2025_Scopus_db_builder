To boost the performance and perform underdetermined DoA estimation, the difference co-array response matrices for all frequency bins are constructed first. Then, to merge the data from different frequency bins, we resort to the Jacobi-Anger approximation to transform the co-array response matrices of all frequency bins into a single virtual uniform linear array (ULA) response matrix. The major advantage of this approach is that the transformation matrices are all signal independent. For the special case where all sources share an identical distribution of the power spectrum, we develop two super-resolution off-the-grid DoA estimation approaches based on atomic norm minimization (ANM), one with and one without prior knowledge of the power spectrum. Our solution is able to resolve more sources than the number of antennas but also more than the number of degrees of freedom (DoF) of the difference co-array of the SLA. For the general case where each source has an arbitrary power spectrum, we propose a multi-task ANM method to exploit the joint sparsity from all frequency bins. Simulation results show that our proposed methods present a clear performance advantage over existing methods, and achieve an estimation accuracy close to the associated Cramér-Rao bounds (CRBs).  © 1991-2012 IEEE.","Atomic norm minimization (ANM); Jacobi-Anger approximation; Sparse linear array (SLA); Wideband direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Direction of arrival; Jacobian matrices; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Power spectrum; Different frequency; Direction of arrival estimation; Direction of arrivalestimation(DOA); Multiple frequency; Number of degrees of freedom; Sparse linear arrays; Transformation matrices; Uniform linear arrays; Frequency estimation","","","","","NWO-TTW; China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201806070119); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, (61871091, 61934008)","Manuscript received June 26, 2020; revised February 1, 2021 and June 19, 2021; accepted June 22, 2021.

This is a very interesting and challenging nonlinear inverse coefficient problem with important applications in various fields ranging from radioactive decay, melting or cooling processes, electronic chips, acoustics and geophysics to medicine. Unique solvability theorems of these inverse problems are supplied. However, since the problems are still ill-posed (a small modification in the input data can lead to bigger impact on the ultimate result in the output solution) the solution needs to be regularized. Therefore, in order to obtain a stable solution, a regularized objective function is minimized in order to retrieve the unknown coefficient. The two-dimensional inverse problem is discretized using the forward time central space (FTCS) finite-difference method (FDM), which is conditionally stable and recast as a nonlinear least-squares minimization of the Tikhonov regularization function. Numerically, this is effectively solved using the MATLAB subroutine lsqnonlin. Both exact and noisy data are inverted. Numerical results for a few benchmark test examples are presented, discussed and assessed with respect to the FTCS-FDM mesh size discretisation, the level of noise with which the input data is contaminated, and the choice of the regularization parameter is discussed based on the trial and error technique. © 2021 CRL Publishing.

The outcomes of safety and risk analyses have become much more thorough and sophis-ticated. They have become an industry standard of safety investigations in many airlines nowadays. In the past, airlines were much more limited in answering the ques-tions about hazardous situations, accident probabilities, and accident rates. Airlines try hard to cope with stricter safety standards. The objective of this paper is to find out and quantify the extent of the expert judgment in help-ing airlines in the evaluation of the Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) events. On top of that, the paper reveals the method for a careful choice of experts, so that their estimations will maximize the potential of an accurate and useful outcome. Also, the paper provides details of implementation of the classical model into this research, then continues with the calculations and visualization of the outcomes. The outcomes are probability distributions per each aircraft type, then per IATA accident type and finally per FDM event. © 2021, Faculty of Transport and Traffic Engineering.

The 3-in-1 3D printers, desktop machines that integrate the three primary functions in a single user-friendly set-up are now available for computer-controlled adaptable surface processing, for less than USD 1000. Here, we demonstrate that 3-in-1 3D printer-based micromachining is an effective strategy for creating microfluidic devices and an easier and more economical alternative to, for instance, conventional photolithography. Our aim was to produce plastic microfluidic chips with engraved microchannel structures or micro-structured plastic molds for casting polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chips with microchannel imprints. The reproducability and accuracy of fabrication of microfluidic chips with straight, crossed line and Y-shaped microchannel designs were assessed and their microfluidic performance checked by liquid stream tests. All three fabrication methods of the 3-in-1 3D printer produced functional microchannel devices with adequate solution flow. Accordingly, 3-in-1 3D printers are recommended as cheap, accessible and user-friendly tools that can be operated with minimal training and little starting knowledge to successfully fabricate basic microfluidic devices that are suitable for educational work or rapid prototyping. © 2021 by the authors.

AM and CM techniques were integrated to control the fiber orientation (microstructure) and to reduce void content for the improved mechanical performance of the composite. The new integrated manufacturing technique is termed “additive manufacturing-compression molding” (AM-CM). For the present study, the most common materials were used for large-scale printing, i.e., acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), carbon fiber (CF)–filled ABS (CF/ABS) and glass fiber (GF)–filled ABS (GF/ABS). Three different manufacturing processes; (a) AM (b) extrusion compression molding (ECM), and (c) AM-CM were used to prepare four different panel configurations: (1) neat ABS, (2) CF/ABS, (3) overmold (CF/ABS over neat ABS), and (4) sandwich (neat ABS between two CF/ABS layers). The mechanical properties (tensile and flexural strength and modulus, and Izod impact energy) of samples prepared via all three manufacturing processes were compared. X-ray microcomputer tomography was employed to evaluate the fiber orientation distribution and the volumetric porosity content. The preform maintained high fiber alignment (≈ 82% of fibers within the range of 0–20° in the deposition direction), and the volumetric porosity was reduced by 50% from 3.79% to 1.91% after compression. The alignment of long pores along the deposition direction was also observed. The mechanical properties are discussed with correlation to the fiber alignment and void content in the samples. CF/ABS samples prepared by AM-CM showed significant improvement of 11.15%, 35.27%, 28.6%, and 74.3% in the tensile strength, tensile modulus, flexural strength, and flexural modulus, respectively, when compared with samples prepared by ECM. Unique aspects of this study are the demonstration of large-scale multimaterial AM and the use of multimaterials as preforms to make high-performance composites. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Fiber orientation distribution; Mechanical properties; Multimaterial; Porosity","3D printers; Additives; Alignment; Bending strength; Deposition; Extrusion molding; Fibers; Graphite fibers; Morphology; Porosity; Preforming; Reinforced plastics; Styrene; Tensile strength; Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene; Extrusion compression moldings; Fiber orientation distribution; High performance composites; Integrated manufacturing; Mechanical performance; Microcomputer tomography; Thermoplastic composite; Compression molding","","","","","DOE-EERE; Advanced Manufacturing Office, AMO; Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EERE; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL","This research was supported by the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Advanced Manufacturing Office and used resources at the Manufacturing Demonstration Facility (MDF), a DOE-EERE User Facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

One new interesting but yet small field of application is the 3D printing of complex optical elements. However, the functional optical performance like the grade of transmission or reflection of such optics is highly dependent on the surface quality. Thus, ultra-short pulsed laser ablation as a very precise ablation technology was investigated as a post-processing technology for AM. However, for additive manufactured parts the rough and inhomogeneous surface as well as pores make it challenging to create a homogenous ablation over a larger area. In this work, a parameter study using various laser parameters for single track ablation on additive manufactured AlSi10Mg0.4 surfaces is presented. The dependence between the ablated volume, in depth and width, and the set laser parameters are discussed. ©2021,JLMN-Journal of Laser Micro/Nanoengineering","additive manufacturing; AlSi10Mg0.4; laser ablation; metal optics; optical structures; post-processing; ultra-short pulsed laser","Ablation; Additives; Laser ablation; Pulsed lasers; Ultrafast lasers; Ablated volume; Ablation technologies; Laser parameters; Metallic surface; Optical performance; Parameter studies; Post-processing technologies; Ultra-short pulsed; 3D printers","","","","","Aalen University; FH-Invest; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (03FH4I04IA, 13FH114N6)","The authors would like to thank Prof. Dr. Andreas Heinrich from the Center of Optical Technologies at Aalen University, David Kolb and Tim Schubert for their support.

Based on Herz-Mindlin contact theory, the contact mechanics model of seed and powder was established. Besides, CPFD software was used to model and simulate the pelleting premixer, and the contact, collision and friction rules among particles were analysed. The simulation and experimental results show that with the increase of inlet wind speed, the bed expansion increases and the unit volume particle concentration decreases, while the air pressure difference only slightly increases. When the inlet wind speed is set at 3.5 m/s, the atomizing nozzle velocity is set at 4.1 m/s, and the seed coating agent flow rate is 0.36 L/min, the particles are suspended due to air isolation, forming a spouted fluidized bed. It is good for seed and powder contact and rapid prototyping. In this time, the pelleting qualified rate was 95.8%. The results provide theoretical basis and technical support for the research of small irregular seeds pelletizing technology. © 2021.

The development of multifunctional tactile sensor remains a challenge and limit its application in flexible electronics and devices. We propose a liquid metal based tactile sensor for both temperature and force sensing which is made by 3D printing. The structural design and working principle of liquid metal based tactile sensor are firstly described. A digital light processing-based printing process is developed to print two kinds of photosensitive resins with different hardness, and used to fabricate the tactile sensor. A Wheatstone bridge circuit is designed for decoupling the temperature and forces from the measured output voltages. Characterization tests show that the tactile sensor has relatively high force sensing sensitivity of 0.29 N-1, and temperature sensing sensitivities are 0.55% °C−1 at 20 ~ 50 °C and 0.21% °C−1 at 50 ~ 80 °C, respectively. Then, the fabricated tactile sensor is mounted onto hand finger to measure the contact force and temperature during grasping. Results show that the 3D printed tactile sensor has excellent flexibility and durability and can accurately measure the temperature and contact forces, which demonstrate its potential in robotic manipulation applications. © 2021 The Author(s).

The significance is determined by the process related state variables. A new approach to control the state variables and to reduce the mechanical anisotropy is based on an extrusion die design concept where material flow components perpendicular to the extrusion direction (ED) are adjusted. Specially shaped internal free-form surfaces require additive manufacturing for the establishment of the dies.

This deformation is dictated by the dynamical properties of the insect wing, particularly its vibration spectra and mode shapes. However, researchers have not yet developed artificial insect wings with vibration spectra and mode shapes that are identical to their biological counterparts. The goal of the present work is to develop artificial insect wings that are both isospectral and isomodal with respect to real insect wings. To do so, we characterized hawkmoth Manduca sexta wings using experimental modal analyses. From these results, we created artificial wings using additive manufacturing and heat molding. Between artificial and real wings, the first two natural frequencies differ by 7% and 16% respectively, with differences of 16% and 131% in gains evaluated at those natural frequencies. Vibration modes are similar as well. This work provides a foundation for more advanced wing design moving forward. © The Author(s) 2021.","additive manufacturing; bioinspired design; experimental modal analysis; flapping wing micro air vehicle; Insect flight","3D printers; Deformation; Modal analysis; Natural frequencies; Dynamical properties; Experimental modal analysis; Flapping wing; Insect flight; Insect wings; Manduca sexta; Vibration modes; Vibration spectra; Wings","","","","","Division of Science, Technology and Innovation; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1855383, 1942810, CBET-1855383, CMMI-1942810); National Science Foundation, NSF; Binghamton University","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Grant Nos.

The approach is highly attractive due to characteristics of rapid prototyping which allows quick and easy adjustment in simulation in real time. Thus, avoiding the high costs associated with physical prototypes. The paper presents results (dynamic responses of various vehicle components) and the effects of adjusting various vehicle parameters. The results obtained from simulation is successfully verified in the HIL platform. The result from this study proves the robustness of the simulation and HIL model and control algorithms.

SL recognition systems tackle this issue by using sensors to acquire gesture data later converted into spoken or written language by means of machine-learning algorithms. Within this frame, we propose a wearable electronic-based system for achieving automatic signer-independent recognition of Italian SL. The system is used for recognizing ten signs performed by 17 inexperienced signers. The wearable electronics measure hand, arm, and forearm gestures, by means of a sensory glove (equipped with ten flex sensors) and six inertial measurement units (IMUs). We adopt three classifiers: artificial neural network (ANN), k -nearest neighbors, and support vector machine, with ANN outperforming the others with an accuracy of 95.07%. However, the real key and novel aspect of this work concerns exploring the importance of each sensor for the overall classification accuracy, with the aim of determining the minimum number of sensors (and so minimizing the complexity of the wearable system) necessary to guarantee an acceptable accuracy. As a result, we could drop out three of the six IMUs, obtaining an accuracy as high as 93.91%. In addition, this valuable result was obtained using a signer-independent approach, which makes the application closer to a real-life situation.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Flex sensors; inertial measurement unit (IMU); machine learning; sensory glove; sign language (SL) recognition","Audition; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Classification accuracy; Electronic based systems; Inertial measurement unit; K-nearest neighbors; Recognition systems; Sensory gloves; Sign language; Wearable systems; Wearable sensors","","","","","","","Deafness and Hearing Loss Fact Sheet, (2020); Cooper H., Holt B., Bowden R., Visual Analysis of Humans, pp. 539-562, (2011); Saggio G., Cavrini F., Pinto C.A., Recognition of arm-and-hand visual signals by means of SVM to increase aircraft security, Proc.

Realizing the potential of these networks will require flexible, low cost, and accurate Digital Signal Processing (DSP). Supervised Learning (SL) models employing unknown parameter estimation and classification techniques have experienced widespread use in physical (PHY) layer wireless communication systems since they can achieve low costs via inexpensive forward-pass computations, attain flexible operations due to trainable parameters, and yield accurate results based on the universal approximator attribute. In this survey and tutorial paper, we present a methodical explanation of how SL can be applied to unknown parameter estimation and classification across several different PHY layer components of a wireless communications system. Additionally, via a survey and comparison of popular methods, this paper provides insights on how to perform weight training, weight initialization, loss function regularization, data pre-processing, input feature design, ensemble training, and hyper-parameter validation. In our review of state-of-the-art works, we found significant use of SL algorithms in the following PHY layer applications: Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA), channel corrections, Automatic Gain Control (AGC), Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) control, Analog to Digital (ADC) conversion, and Automatic Coding and Modulation (ACM). The overarching goal of this survey and tutorial paper is to assist the reader in understanding the motivation and methodologies associated with various SL algorithms applied to PHY layer DSP operations, as well as to provide the reader with the necessary tools and techniques needed for addressing open challenges to be experienced by future wireless networks. © 2013 IEEE.","Digital signal processing; machine learning; parameter estimation and classification; physical layer; supervised learning; wireless communications","Analog to digital conversion; Costs; Data handling; Digital signal processing; E-learning; Modulation; Network layers; Parameter estimation; Quality of service; Supervised learning; Surveys; Wireless networks; Emerging wireless networks; Learning models; Low-costs; Orders of magnitude; Parameter estimation and classification; Parameters estimation; Physical layers; Quality-of-service; Wireless communication system; Wireless communications; MIMO systems","","","","","","","Strom N., Scalable distributed DNN training using commodity GPU cloud computing, Proc. 16th Annu.

It was found that the design parameters like revolution and radius of helical architectures highly affected the filament fusion or bonding during the fabrication process. The bonding-induced interlaced helical architectures resulted in a more uniform deformation pattern and a lower modulus. μCT-based finite element method was established to predict the large deformation responses of the scaffolds with helical architectures and patient-specific scaffold potentially for breast reconstruction, which showed well agreement with the experimental results. The fabricated scaffolds exhibited good shape recovery capability even under cyclical compression at a strain of about 20% for 10000 times. This exploration offers a promising way to predict the mechanical responses of flexible scaffolds with complex helical architectures under large deformation conditions. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Additive manufacturing;

Coherent fiber bundles (CFBs) enable ultrathin lensless endoscopes. However, the propagation of light through a CFB suffers from phase distortions and aberrations that can cause images to be scrambled. The correction of such aberrations has been demonstrated using various techniques for wavefront control, especially using spatial light modulators (SLMs). This study investigates a novel aberration correction without SLM for the creation of an efficient and compact system. The memory effect of CFBs enables a paradigm shift in the use of static diffractive optical elements (DOEs) instead of dynamic modulation with SLM. We introduce DOEs produced by 2-photon polymerization lithography for phase conjugation on a CFB for focusing, raster scanning, and imaging. Furthermore, a DOE with random patterns is used to encode the three-dimensional (3D) object information in a 2D speckle pattern that propagates along the ultra-thin CFB. Neural networks decode the speckles to retrieve the 3D object information using single-shot imaging. Both DOE methods have compact low-cost concepts in common, and both pave the way for minimally invasive 3D endomicroscopy with benefits for optical imaging in biomedicine. © The Author(s) 2021.","","","","","","","DOEs; Institute for Integrative Nanosciences; Leibniz IFW Dresden; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (CZ 55/47-1, CZ 55/48-1); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) under grants (CZ 55/47-1) and (CZ 55/48-1).

For the construction of complex geological conditions of an underground mine with a depth of 1300 m in the Central Plains of China, based on the finite difference method (FDM) with high calculation accuracy, using FLAC $^{\mathrm {3D}}$ software based on FDM, and using progressive design method (PDM), design a variety of different schemes and analyze the mechanism of force and deformation of the surrounding rock mass of the project. Apply the obtained optimal scheme in actual engineering, and monitor the actual force and deformation. Comparing the results of the computer numerical simulation with the monitoring results, the results show that the computer numerical simulation method can also have good application in the actual engineering under the geological conditions of ultra-kilometer depth. It also provides theoretical basis and technical guidance for engineering hypothesis under approximate conditions.  © 2013 IEEE.","Computer numerical simulation method; FDM; field monitoring; FlAC3D; PDM; support schemes","Deformation; Finite difference method; Geology; Numerical models; Calculation accuracy; Complex engineering; Complex geological condition; Finitedifference methods (FDM); Geological conditions; Numerical simulation method; Surrounding rock mass; Technical guidances; Numerical methods","","","","","","","Atia M.G.B., El-Hussieny H., Salah O., A supervisory-based collaborative obstacle-guided path refinement algorithm for path planning in wide terrains, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 214672-214684, (2020); Tak B.-O., Ro J.-S., Analysis and design of an axial flux permanent magnet motor for in-wheel system using a novel analytical method combined with a numerical method, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 203994-204011, (2020); Kaneko A., Hayashi Y., Anegawa T., Hokazono H., Kuwashita Y., Evaluation of an optimal radial-loop configuration for a distribution network with PV systems to minimize power loss, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 220408-220421, (2020); Tian Z., Jing S., Liu W., Gao S., Zhang J., Experimental and numerical study on cutting performance of coal plow, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 211882-211891, (2020); Lei J., Xue B., Fang H., Li Y., Yang M., Forward analysis of GPR for underground pipes using CUDA-implemented conformal symplectic euler algorithm, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 205590-205599, (2020); Tabatabaei J., Moghaddam M.S., Baigi J.M., Rearrangement of electrical distribution networks with optimal coordination of grid-connected hybrid electric vehicles and wind power generation sources, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 219513-219524, (2020); Tahkola M., Keranen J., Sedov D., Far M.F., Kortelainen J., Surrogate modeling of electrical machine torque using arti_cial neural networks, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 220027-220045, (2020); Wu Y., Qiao W., Zhang S., Zhang Z., Li Y., Fan Z., Zhang L., Application of computer simulation method in deep underground engineering of complicated geological condition, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 174943-174963, (2020); Wu Y., Yang X.-X., Sun D.-K., Experimental investigation of the mechanical behaviors of brittle rock materials containing en echelon boreholes, Arabian J.

Materials and manufacturing technologies were used with an emphasis on near term applicability with design trades between the aerodynamic performance and structural response. Aerodynamic performance was assessed on three wind tunnel models varying span (432, 600, and 762 mm), wind speed (Reynolds numbers 18,000, 36,000, and 71,000), additive manufacturing print build plane and camber, quantifying structural response as the resulting shape during aerodynamic loading. Each model displayed increasing compliance as span increased with wing-tip displacement on the order of 50, 100, and 200 mm with various degrees of sweep and twist. Models generated excess lift at Re = 71,000 indicating potential flight demonstration of the technology with a lift to drag improvement of up to 97% at maximum wing extension. © The Author(s) 2021.","Additive manufacturing; flight adaptation; spanwise morphing","Automobile materials; Lift; Microstrip antennas; Reynolds number; Structural design; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Wind; Wind tunnels; Wings; Aero-dynamic performance; Aerodynamic loading; Flight demonstration; Manufacturing technologies; Small unmanned aerial vehicles; Structural response; Tip displacement; Wind tunnel models; 3D printers","","","","","Army Research Laboratory, ARL","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research was funded by the Army Research Laboratory.

To fabricate OBEs, polyimide (PI) substrate has been used as it provides properties like low-cost fabrication, high selectivity, great stability, easy reproducibility, cost-effectiveness and rapid prototyping. Moreover, graphene can be created on PI in a single step during the ablation of the CO2 laser. Android smartphone was efficiently used to sense ECL signals as well as to drive the required voltage to the OBEs. With the optimized parameters, the imaging system was successfully used to detect Hydrogen Peroxide (H2 O2) with a linear range of 1 \mu \text{M} to 100~\mu \text{M} and detection of limit (LOD) 5.8729~\mu \text{M} (R2 = 0.9449, n = 3).

Further, real samples were tested to manifest the workability of the platform for random samples. Overall, the developed low-cost, rapidly realized and the miniaturized system can be used in many biomedical applications, environmental monitoring and point-of-care testings. © 2002-2011 IEEE.","CO₂ laser; Electrochemiluminescence; laser-induced graphene; open bipolar electrodes; polyimide; sensor","Biosensing Techniques; Electrochemical Techniques; Electrodes; Graphite; Lasers; Reproducibility of Results; Carbon dioxide lasers; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Graphene; Graphite electrodes; Hydrogen peroxide; Medical applications; Substrates; graphite; Biomedical applications; Bipolar electrodes; Electrochemiluminescence; Environmental Monitoring; Graphene electrodes; Low cost fabrication; Miniaturized systems; Optimized parameter; electrochemical analysis; electrode; genetic procedures; laser; reproducibility; 3D printers","","graphite, 7782-42-5; Graphite, ","","","DST-SERB, (CRG/2019/005468); Department of Science and Technology, Science and Engineering Research Board","Manuscript received August 16, 2020; revised October 4, 2020 and October 13, 2020; accepted October 28, 2020.

The quality of digital color printing is determined by these influential factors: Screening method applied, type of printing process, ink (dry-toner or liquid-toner), printer resolution and the substrate (paper). For this research, only the color printing attributes such as the G7 colors hue and chroma, gray balance, and overall color deviations were analyzed to examine the significant differences that exist between the two output profiles [Output Device Profile (ODP) vs Device Link Profile (DLP)]. These are the color attributes which are monitored and managed for quality accuracy during the printing. Printed colorimetry of each profile from the experiment was compared against G7 ColorSpace GRACoL 2013 (CGATS21-2-CRPC6) in CIE L*a*b*space using an IDEAlliance (Chromix/Hutch Color) Curve 4.2.4 application interface with an X-Rite spectrophotometer with an i1iO table. The measured data of each profile were run through this application (Curve 4.2.4). The data were analyzed by using the Verify Tool of the Curve 4.2.4 application to determine the pass/fail of G7 master compliance levels using G7 ColorSpace tolerances (G7 Grayscale, G7 Targeted, and G7 Colorspace). Analyzed data from the experiment revealed that the printed colorimetric values of each profile (G7 Grayscale, G7 Targeted, and G7 Colorspace) are in match (aligned) with the G7 master compliance levels (reference/ target) colorimetric values (G7 Grayscale, G7 Targeted, and G7 Colorspace). Therefore, the press run was passed by the Curve 4 application for both the profiles used/tested towards aiming for G7 master compliance. © 2020 University of Novi Sad - Faculty of Technical Sciences, Department of Graphic Engineering and Design.

Jr. Blvd., Newark, NJ, United States","The refractive indices, attenuation coefficients, and level of birefringence of various 3D printing plastics may change depending on the printing parameters. Transmission terahertz time-domain spectroscopy was used to look for such effects in Copolyester (CPE), Nylon, Polycarbonate (PC), Polylactic acid, and Polypropylene. The thickness of each sample was measured using an external reference structure and time-of-flight measurements. The parameters varied were printer nozzle size, print layer height, and print orientation. Comparison of these parameters showed that a printer's nozzle size and print layer height caused no change in real refractive index or attenuation coefficient. A change in printing orientation from vertical to horizontal caused an increase both in real refractive index and in attenuation coefficient. In vertically printed samples, the increase in birefringence was proportional to the increase in layer height and inversely proportional to nozzle size. There was no measurable intrinsic birefringence in the horizontally printed samples. These effects should be taken into account in the design of FDM 3D printed structures that demand tailored refractive indices and attenuation coefficients, while also providing a foundation for nondestructive evaluation of FDM 3D printed objects and structures. © 2021 Alexander T.

Conventional methods generally suffer from performance loss in the long-distance over-the-horizon (OTH) scenario due to uncertain ionospheric conditions. To overcome the adverse effects of the unknown and complex ionosphere on positioning, we propose a deep learning positioning method based on multistation received signals and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network framework (SL-BiLSTM), which refines position information from signal data. Specifically, we first obtain the form of the network input by constructing the received signal model. Second, the proposed method is developed to predict target positions using an SL-BiLSTM network, consisting of three BiLSTM layers, a maxout layer, a fully connected layer, and a regression layer. Then, we discuss two regularization techniques of dropout and randomization which are mainly adopted to prevent network overfitting. Simulations of OTH localization are conducted to examine the performance. The parameters of the network have been trained properly according to the scenario. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the accuracy of OTH positioning at low SNR. When the number of training locations increases to 200, the positioning result of SL-BiLSTM is closest to CRLB at high SNR.  © 2021 Wanting Yu et al.","","Complex networks; Deep learning; Ionosphere;

Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications for platooning are considered to be one of new 5G use cases requiring low-latency and ultra-reliability are required. This paper presents our field trial of dynamic mode switching for 5G New Radio (NR) based V2X sidelink communications towards application to truck platooning. The authors build a field trial environment, for V2X communications of truck platooning, with actual large-size trucks and a prototype system employing 5G NR technologies, and performed some field trials in rural areas. In this paper, we introduce the 5G NR-V2X prototype system. Its most distinctive characteristic is that the prototype system is equipped with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) Direct communication radio interface (i.e., sidelink), in addition to the traditional radio interfaces between base station (BS) and user equipment (UE), i.e., downlink and uplink. Moreover, it is also most distinctive that the sidelink (SL) interface supports a new function of dynamic mode switching between two modes of BS In-Coverage mode (SL Mode-1) and BS Out-of-Coverage mode (SL Mode-2) in order to achieve seamless V2V communications between BS in-coverage area and BS out-of-coverage area. Then, we present the evaluation results on over-the-air latency performance on the V2V Direct communication of the prototype using SL dynamic mode switching with two experimental base station antenna sites in a public express highway environment towards application to truck platooning. The results demonstrate that our developed the SL dynamic mode switching achieves the seamless V2V Direct communications between in-coverage area and out-of-coverage area.

As a reliable estimation methodology, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) has been widely utilized in vehicle control. However, the estimation accuracy still needs to be improved caused by the unpredictable measurement and process noise. In this paper, a novel modified UKF state estimation methodology combined with the ant lion optimization (ALO) is proposed for the stability control of a four in-wheel motor independent drive electric vehicle (4WIDEV). First, the optimal performance of the ALO algorithm is analyzed, where both unimodal and multimodal optimization test functions are selected and optimized by GA, PSO, and ALO, respectively. The results indicate that the ALO algorithm has good global optimization capability and applicability. Second, the ALO algorithm is merged into the UKF to adjust the statistical properties of noise information for the ALOUKF estimator design without extra sensor signals. At last, the simulations on the Matlab/Simulink-CarSim co-simulation platform and the road test based on an AandD 5435 rapid prototyping experiment platform (RPP) are carried out to verify the proposed method. The simulation and experiment results demonstrate that the ALOUKF estimator can improve state estimation accuracy and resist the vehicle nonlinearity even in the case of the complicated and emergency maneuvers.  © 2021 Yixi Zhang et al.","","Control system synthesis;

Three types of periodic structures, 780 nm of nanoscale, microscale (10 – 30 μm), and hierarchical, were fabricated on stainless steel using a femto-second-pulsed laser by adjusting the number of repetition shots and their pitch. The measured pitches of the two-beam laser interference agreed well with the calculated values. The experimental data demonstrated that it was possible to process hierarchical structures by an optical unit for interference patterning that could produce patterns with any pitch and depth. The pitch of the periodic structures was controlled by the diffraction angle, and their depth was controlled by the number of repetition shots. In the proposed optical unit, a mask containing multiple holes was an essential component for the LCOS-SLM to block the harmonic waves in the subsequent laser interference. The coefficient of variation of the apparent contact angle was smaller for the hierarchical structures than for the mi-croscale periodic structures.

Accordingly, this study aims to build up a methodology which combines simulation model and experimental approach to fabricate high-density (>99.9%) IN713LC components using LPBF process. Design/methodology/approach: The present study commences by performing three-dimensional (3D) heat transfer finite element simulations to predict the LPBF outcome (e.g. melt pool depth, temperature and mushy zone extent) for 33 representative sample points chosen within the laser power and scanning speed design space. The simulation results are used to train a surrogate model to predict the LPBF result for any combination of the processing conditions within the design space. Then, experimental trials were performed to choose the proper hatching space and also to define the high crack susceptibility criterion. The process map is then filtered in accordance with five quality criteria, namely, avoiding the keyhole phenomenon, improving the adhesion between the melt pool and the substrate, ensuring single-scan-track stability, avoiding excessive melt pool evaporation and suppressing the formation of micro-cracks, to determine the region of the process map which improves the relative density of the IN713LC component and minimizes the micro-cracks. The optimal processing conditions are used to fabricate IN713LC specimens for tensile testing purposes. Findings: The optimal processing conditions predicted by simulation model are used to fabricate IN713LC specimens for tensile testing purposes. Experimental results show that the tensile strength and elongation of 3D-printed IN713LC tensile bar is higher than those of tensile bar made by casting. The yield strength of 791 MPa, ultimate strength of 995 MPa, elongation of 12%, and relative density of 99.94% are achieved. Originality/value: The present study proposed a systematic methodology to find the processing conditions that are able to minimize the formation of micro-crack and improve the density of the high crack susceptivity metal material in LPBF process. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Inconel 713LC; Laser powder bed fusion; Parameter optimization; Solidification cracking","3D printers; Fabrication; Heat transfer performance; Lakes; Materials testing apparatus; Nickel alloys; Powder metals; Stability criteria; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Crack susceptibilities; Design/methodology/approach; Experimental approaches; Finite element simulations; Representative sample; Strength and elongations; Systematic methodology; Threedimensional (3-d); Laser materials processing","","","","","Ministry of Education, MOE; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST, (107-2218-E-006-051, MOST 110-2222-E-218-002-MY2); Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST; National Cheng Kung University, NCKU; Intelligent Manufacturing Research Center, iMRC","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided to this study by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan under Grant No. MOST 107-2218-E-006-051 and MOST 110-2222-E-218-002-MY2.

HEAs are constructed with five or more principal alloying elements in equimolar or near-equimolar ratios. Therefore, they can derive their performance from multiple principal elements rather than a single element. In this work, three-dimensional printing laser cladding was applied to produce an Al0.4CoCu0.6NiSi0.2Ti0.25 HEA coating. The experimental results confirmed that the laser cladding could be used to produce a thin coating of 120 μm in thickness. In the high-temperature laser cladding process, some Fe elements diffused from the substrate to the coating, forming a combination of face-centred cubic and body-centred cubic phase structures. The HEA coating metallurgically bonded well with the substrate. Owing to the increased dislocation density and number of grain boundaries, the HEA coating was harder and had a stronger hydrophobicity than X70 steel. The electrochemistry results showed that the HEA coating had better corrosion resistance than X70 steel. Aluminium oxides formed on the surface of the HEA coating had a certain protective effect. However, because of the laser cladding, the HEA coating generated cracks. In future work, the laser cladding technology will be improved and heat treatment will be implemented to prevent formation of cracks. © 2020","Corrosion behaviour; High-entropy alloy coating (HEA coating); Laser cladding","3D printers; Alloying elements; Aluminum coated steel; Aluminum oxide; Corrosion resistance; Corrosive effects; Cracks; Entropy; Grain boundaries; High-entropy alloys; Laser cladding; Metal cladding; Phase structure; Steel corrosion; Sulfur; Body-centred cubic; Corrosion behavior; Dislocation densities; Face-centred cubic; Laser cladding technology; Laser-cladding process; Materials science and engineering; Protective effects; Corrosion resistant coatings","","","","","National Environmental Corrosion Platform; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51701055); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Science Foundation of China University of Petroleum, Beijing, (2462018YJRC021); Science Foundation of China University of Petroleum, Beijing; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (21619401); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Major Science and Technology Projects of China; National Science and Technology Major Project, (2016ZX05057001); National Science and Technology Major Project","Funding text 1: This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51701055 ), Science Foundation of China University of Petroleum, Beijing (Nos. 2462018YJRC021 ), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( 21619401 ), National Science and Technology Major Project of the Miristry of Science and Technology of China ( 2016ZX05057001 ) and National Environmental Corrosion Platform .; Funding text 2: This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51701055), Science Foundation of China University of Petroleum, Beijing (Nos. 2462018YJRC021), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (21619401), National Science and Technology Major Project of the Miristry of Science and Technology of China (2016ZX05057001) and National Environmental Corrosion Platform.","Yeh J.W., Chen S.-K., Lin S.-J., Gan J.-Y., Chin T.-S., Shun T.-T., Tsau C.-H., Chang S.-Y., Adv.

For such manufacture, two adjacent and parallel fiber yarns made with carbon-fiber embedded in the polymer matrix were deposited by using a 3D printer system. These flexible flow sensors were made of two nylon wall layers, had a fixed separating distance between conductive carbon filament and were printed on nylon peel-ply. Thickness of the nylon walls and filaments separating distance were optimised and tested with different vacuum-assisted resin infusion (VARI) experimental trials by measuring the voltage drop between their filaments edges in order to monitor properly the resin frontal flow. It is concluded that the sensing configuration presented here as a removable fiber/polymer unit could be used for obtaining high-quality composites by monitoring the resin frontal flow. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Flexible electronics; Parallel carbon-fiber yarns; Real-time monitoring; Resistive sensors; VARI","Graphite fibers; Polyamides; Rayon; Reinforced plastics; Resins; Carbon fiber reinforced; Composite manufacturing; Conductive carbon; Experimental trials; Flow monitoring; Resistive sensor; Sensing configuration; Vacuum assisted resin infusions; 3D printers","","","","","Regional Government of Madrid","The research leading to the results presented in this paper received funding from the Regional Government of Madrid through the research and innovation Innovation Hubs 2018 through the TEMACOM Project.

The as-built alloy showed a heterogeneous microstructure made up of α–Mg matrix, Al8Mn5 second phase particles, MgO layers and Mg17Al12continuous precipitates. After solution treatment followed by aging, Mg17Al12 discontinuous precipitates were observed. The sintered samples showed a yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of 79 and 207 MPa, respectively, in the horizontal configuration.

Light optical microscope (LOM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used for microstructure characterization. Automated inclusion/precipitation analysis was performed by Thermoscientific Explorer-4. By this study, it is aimed to understand the hydrogen permeation properties of ultra-low carbon IF steel material with varying strain values. Finally, it was determined that number of inclusion/precipitation per mm2 was significantly increased as a function of strain ratio, which improves hydrogen permeation properties. © EDP Sciences, 2021.","Enameling steel characterization; Fish scale; Forming simulation; Hydrogen permeability; Low carbon steel","Hydrogen; Permeation; Scanning electron microscopy; 3D deformation measurements; Deep drawing tests; Effect of strain; Hydrogen diffusion coefficients; Hydrogen permeability; Hydrogen permeation properties; Microstructure characterization; Ultra low carbon IF steels; Low carbon steel","","","","","","","Properties and Selection: Irons, Steels and High Performance Alloys, 1, (1993); Fu-Tao D., Lin-Xiu D., Xiang-Hua L., Jun H., Fei X., Effect of Ti(C N) precipitation on texture evolution and fish-scale resistance of ultra-low carbon Ti-bearing enamel steel, J.

AAM assumes the surface load spreads with soil depth into an ever-increasing rectangular area whose dimensions are controlled by a constant spread angle u usually taken as 30°, denoted as AAM-30°. Both simplified and comprehensive culvert analysis procedures utilize AAM predictions for adjusting pressure distributions acting on the culvert periphery. Also, AAM-30° is routinely used to determine the twowheel soil interaction depth, in which the combined effect of both axial wheels need to be considered. To date, a thorough accuracy analysis of AAM-30° has not been published in the open literature. This paper provides a unique and rigorous evaluation of AAM-30° using an exact solution from an elasticity-based model (EBM) of a homogeneous half-space with rectangular surface load. One key discovery is the depth parameter called y*, which is the soil depth at which AAM-30° peak-stress prediction exactly matches the exact EBM solution. Moreover, it is shown that y* may be determined by a simple, yet accurate formula that only depends on the square root of the load area. However, the investigation reveals that AAM-30° significantly underestimates peak stress in the shallow-depth zone 0 \ y \ ½y* by as much as 31.3% of the applied surface pressure. As this is a large nonconservative error it cannot be ignored. Accordingly, a very simple modification is introduced called AAM-u*, in which u* is a spread angle that linearly increases to 30° at soil depth ½y* and thereafter u* remains constant at 30°. An accuracy evaluation of AAM-u* reveals an order of magnitude increase in accuracy in which the small residual error is conservative, not nonconservative. The paper concludes with discussions on applying AAM-u* to the analysis of buried culverts when using either simple or finite element model solution procedures. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2021.","","Culverts; Forecasting; Soils; Stress analysis; Wheels; Ad hoc methods; Buried culverts; Elasticity based model; Model solution; Nonconservative; Peak stress; Simple++; Soil depth; Spread angle; Surface loads; Geometry","","","","","","","AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, (2017); Proposed Modifications to AASHTO Culvert Load Rating Specifications, (2019); Davis Elastic Solutions for Soil and Rock Mechanics; Katona M.G., Continuous Load Scaling: A New Method to Simulate Longitudinal Live-Load Spreading for 2D Finite Element Analysis of Buried Culverts, Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, 2642, pp. 77-90, (2017)","M.G.

Additively manufactured (AM) thermoplastic composites suffer weak interlayer bonding and high void contents. This study investigates the use of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) to post-process AM continuous carbon fiber reinforced polyetheretherketone (PEEK) composites to improve their flexural, interlaminar shear, tensile, and compressive properties. Isostatic pressure (200 psi) and elevated temperatures were used in combination to compress internal voids, promote PEEK crystallization, and enhance inter-filament polymer diffusion.Three different HIP temperatures of 200 °C, 250 °C, and 300 °C, between the glass transition and heat deflection temperatures of the composites, were considered. The post-processing was found to improve properties, with flexural strength and interlaminar shear strength improvements of up to 46% and 30%, respectively, and tensile strength and modulus reaching values as high as 1312 MPa and 92 GPa. The accompanying changes in void content and polymer structure for various HIP processing parameters were investigated to account for the changes in mechanical properties and failure mechanisms. Specifically, increasing the treatment temperature was found to monotonically reduce the void content. The polymer degree of crystallinity (DOC), however, was found to change appreciably only for the highest treatment temperature (300 °C), which negatively impacted the flexural and interlaminar composite properties. Treatment at 300 °C is understood to embrittle the polymer matrix, thereby increasing the stress concentration factors of the internal porosity. HIP demonstrates a fast and robust method to post-process AM composite parts, resulting in a significant improvement in their mechanical performance whereas a high crystallinity with void presence could degrade the performance of AM composites. The outcome of this study can be utilized to improve both the additive manufacturing process and post-HIP treatment to enhance the performance of AM composites. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Carbon fiber; Composite; Hot isostatic pressing; PEEK","3D printers; Additives; Composite structures; Crystallinity; Glass transition; Graphite fibers; Hot isostatic pressing; Reinforced plastics; Shear strength; Sintering; Stress concentration; Tensile strength; Additive manufacturing process; Carbon fiber reinforced; Carbon fiber reinforced PEEK composite; Degree of crystallinity; Heat deflection temperature; Inter-laminar shear strengths; Stress concentration factors; Thermoplastic composite; Failure (mechanical)","","","","","ARFL/RV; U.S., (FA9453-18-2-0022); Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the support by the Air Force Research Laboratory, U.S. under Cooperative Agreement FA9453-18-2-0022.

Their design into non-stochastic configurations is known to be beneficial for the tailor and control of their mechanical properties. The current developments on additive manufacturing allow a successful route to manufacture these scaffolds and gives a novel freedom in their design process. This study explores the deformation behavior of axisymmetric non-stochastic cellular solids, allowing the understanding of the mechanisms that enhance their mechanical properties relatively to regular extruded lattices. It is shown that axisymmetric samples display a circumferential deformation effect that distributed loads along the volume of the material. This effect, however, is more prominent in axisymmetric samples with auxetic behavior. The coupling of circumferential deformation and the dynamic density changes in auxetic samples generate an overall increase in modulus, collapse stress and energy absorption. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing;

Typically, hundreds, if not thousands, of independent antenna channels are used to achieve high SNR for throughput and increased capacity. Using a dedicated ADC per antenna receiver is preferable but it's not practical for very large arrays due to unreasonable cost and complexity. Frequency division multiplexing (FDM) is a well-known technique for combining multiple signals into a single wideband channel. In a first of its kind measurements, this paper explores FDM for combining multiple antenna outputs at IF into a single wideband signal that can be sampled and digitized using a high-speed wideband ADC. The sampled signals are sub-band filtered and digitally down-converted to obtain individual antenna channels. A prototype receiver was realized with a uniform linear array consisting of 4 elements with 250 MHz bandwidth per channel at 28 GHz carrier frequency. Each of the receiver chains were frequency-multiplexed at an intermediate frequency of 1 GHz to avoid the requirement for multiple, precise local oscillators (LOs). Combined narrowband receiver outputs were sampled using a single ADC with digital front-end operating on a Xilinx ZCU-1285 RF SoC FPGA to synthesize 4 digital beams. The approach allows $M$ -fold increase in spatial degrees of freedom per ADC, for temporal oversampling by a factor of $M$. © 2013 IEEE.","Analog-digital conversion; antenna arrays; millimeter wave radio communication; MIMO systems","Analog to digital conversion; Beam forming networks; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Digital radio; Digital to analog conversion; Frequency division multiplexing; Microwave antennas; Millimeter waves; Signal to noise ratio; Analog-digital conversion; Antenna channel; Beamforming antenna; Digitisation; Frequency-division- multiplexing; High SNR; Millimeter wave radio communications; MIMO receivers; Mm-wave frequencies; Per antennas; MIMO systems","","","","","; National Science Foundation, NSF, (800010635); National Science Foundation, NSF","This work was supported in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant 800010635.","Rappaport T.S., Xing Y., Kanhere O., Ju S., Madanayake A., Mandal S., Alkhateeb A., Trichopoulos G.C., Wireless communications and applications above 100 GHz: Opportunities and challenges for 6G and beyond, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 78729-78757, (2019); Zheng K., Dhananjay A., Mezzavilla M., Madanayake A., Bharadwaj S., Ariyarathna V., Gosain A., Melodia T., Restuccia F., Jornet J., Polese M., Zorzi M., Buckwalter J., Rodwell M., Mandal S., Wang X., Haarla J., Semkin V., Software-defined radios to accelerate mmWave wireless innovation, Proc.

In many of these practical situations, the structures suffer from drop impact loads. Materials and structures significantly change their behavior when submitted to impact loading conditions as compared to quasi-static loading. The present work is devoted to investigating the elastic strain wave in Carbon-Fiber-Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) when subjected to a drop test. A novel drop weight impact test experimental method evaluates parameters specific to 3D composite materials during the study. A strain gauge rosette is employed to record the kinematic on the composites' surface. Experimental results were validated through numerical analysis by FDM Numerical Simulations in MATLAB® and ANSYS® Explicit Dynamic Module. A MATLAB® code was developed to solve wave equation in a 2-D polar coordinate system by discretizing through a Forward-Time Central-Space (FTCS) Finite Difference Method (FDM). Another FEA analysis was performed in ANSYS® Workbench Explicit Dynamics module to simulate the elastic waves produced during the DWIT. The study demonstrates that the elastic waves generated upon impact with a 33 g steel ball from a height of 1 m in a quasi-isotropic CFRP sheet give a strain wave frequency of 205 Hz and finish in almost 0.015 s due to a significant damping effect. Numerical simulations were in good agreement with the experimental findings. © 2021 Multiphysics.

In this computing model, the Quality of Services (QoS) is agreed between service providers and their customers through Service Level Agreements (SLA). There is thus a need for systematic approaches with which to assess the quality of cloud services and their compliance with the SLA. In previous work, we introduced a generic method for Monitoring cloud Services using models at RunTime (MoS@RT), which allows the monitoring requirements or the metric operationalizations of these requirements to be changed at runtime without the modification of the underlying infrastructure. In this paper, we present the design of a monitoring infrastructure that supports the proposed method with its instantiation to a specific platform and reports the results of an experiment carried out to evaluate the perceived efficacy of 58 undergraduate students when using the infrastructure to configure the monitoring of cloud services deployed on the Microsoft Azure platform. The results show that the participants perceived MoS@RT to be easy to use, useful, and they also expressed their intention to use the method in the future. Although further experiments must be carried out to strengthen these results, MoS@RT has proved to be a promising monitoring method for cloud services. © 2013 IEEE.","Cloud computing; models@runtime; quality of service (QoS); services monitoring; software as a service (SaaS)","Monitoring; Quality of service; Students; Windows operating system; Empirical evaluations; Intention to use; Models at run time; Monitoring methods; Service Level Agreements; Service provider; Software services; Undergraduate students; Web services","","","","","UX-Adapt, (AICO/2020/113); Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU, (TIN2017-84550-R); Generalitat Valenciana, GVA","This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Universities through the Adapt@Cloud Project under Grant TIN2017-84550-R, and by the Generalitat Valenciana under the UX-Adapt Project, Grant AICO/2020/113.","Mell P., Grance T., The NIST de-nition of cloud computing, Nat.

This paper reports on an active learning-based instructional approach that prepares students for careers in the drone industry. The approach focuses on three foundational pillars of drone careers: 1) drone programming using Python, 2) designing and fabricating drones using Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and rapid prototyping, and 3) the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 107 Commercial small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (sUAVs) pilot test. The approach was implemented and refined over four semesters in an undergraduate class attended by engineering and computer science students at a research institution located in the United States. A case study approach using multiple assessment methods was implemented to examine students' gains in skills and knowledge and attitudes towards an active learning-based approach for drone education. Assessment methods included direct formative (FAA quizzes and programming assignments), direct summative (capstone project), indirect quantitative (survey of learning gains), and indirect qualitative (focus group interviews and capstone project process videos) tools. Assessment results noted in this paper indicate that students were actively engaged during the course and made positive gains in their learning outcomes. © 2013 IEEE.","drones; education; engineering education; Small unmanned aerial vehicles; STEM education; sUAVs","Antennas; Commercial vehicles; Computer aided design; Computer programming; Drones; Engineering education; Learning systems; Capstone projects; Case study approach; Engineering and computer science; Exponential growth; Programming assignments; Research institutions; Small unmanned aerial vehicles; Us federal aviation administrations; Students","","","","","","","Raeva P.L., Sedina J., Dlesk A., Monitoring of crop fields using multispectral and thermal imagery from UAV, Eur.

The present study deals with hydrogel materials by using the mixture of cell-laden photopolymerizable GelMA as a main printing material and the mixture of alginate and methylcellulose (Alg/MC) as a support material because of its high viscosity and good thixotropic property. One extrusion-based approach is developed by printing the two mixtures into structures in an alternating layer-by-layer manner, with the electrostatic interactions between polycationic GelMA and polyanionic Alg/MC contributing to the integrity of the structures. The final printed structures are exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light to form crosslinks in GelMA through photopolymerization for further structural strengthening. The one-time UV exposure minimizes cell damage in cell-GelMA, demonstrating an advantage over those in previously reported studies that required repeated UV exposures upon the printing of each layer of a structure. The other approach is developed by submerging the extrusion nozzle into a bath of Alg/MC to print cell-laden GelMA structures, which, upon printing completion, are also subject to one-time UV exposure before the removal of the support material Alg/MC. A flower with living cells is printed to demonstrate the capability of the second approach of fabricating structures with geometric complexity. The structures printed using both approaches demonstrate a well-maintained shape fidelity, structural integrity and cell viability of over 93% up to five culturing days. The proposed two printing approaches based on the cell-GelMA and Alg/MC pair will be beneficial for exploring new opportunities in bioprinting. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Alginate; Bioprinting; GelMA; Hydrogel; Methylcellulose; Submerged","3D printers; Cells; Extrusion; Fabrication; Hydrogels; Mixtures; Photopolymerization; Viscosity; Alternating layers; Complex structure; Geometric complexity; Printed structures; Printing materials; Structural strengthening; Thixotropic properties; Ultraviolet lights; Cytology","","","","","National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF; Prime Minister's Office, Brunei Darussalam","Funding text 1: This research is supported by the National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore under its Medium-Sized Centre funding scheme through the Marine and Offshore Program.; Funding text 2: This research is supported by the National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore under its Medium-Sized Centre funding scheme through the Marine and Offshore Program.

V2X communication is a growing area of communication that connects vehicles to neighboring vehicles (V2V), infrastructure (V2I), and pedestrians (V2P). Network slicing is one of the promising technologies for connectivity of the next generation devices, creating several logical networks on a common and programmable physical infrastructure. Network slicing offers an efficient way to satisfy the diverse use case requirements by exploiting the benefits of shared physical infrastructure. In this regard, we propose a network slicing-based communication solution for vehicular networks. In this work, we model a highway scenario with vehicles having heterogeneous traffic demands. The autonomous driving slice (safety messages) and the infotainment slice (video stream) are the two logical slices created on a common infrastructure. We formulated a network clustering and slicing algorithm to partition the vehicles into different clusters and allocate slice leaders (SLs) to each cluster. SLs serve its clustered vehicles with high-quality V2V links and forwards safety information with low latency. On the other hand, road side unit provides infotainment service using high-quality V2I links. An extensive Long Term Evolution Advanced system-level simulator with enhancement of cellular V2X standard is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, in which it is shown that the proposed network slicing technique achieves low latency and high-reliability communication. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","Clustering algorithms; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Vehicle to infrastructure; Autonomous driving; Communication solutions; Heterogeneous traffic; Network Clustering; Safety information; Slicing algorithms; Vehicular communications; Vehicular networks; Vehicles","","","","","Academy of Finland","This research has been supported by the Academy of Finland 6Genesis Flagship project and the Thule institute strategic project SAFARI.","Araniti G., Campolo C., Condoluci M., Iera A., Molinaro A., LTE for vehicular networking: a survey, IEEE Commun Mag, 51, 5, pp. 148-157, (2013); National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey, (2008); Le L., Festag A., Baldessari R., Zhang W., Vehicular wireless short-range communication for improving intersection safety, IEEE Commun Mag, 47, 11, pp. 104-110, (2009); Vinel A., 3GPP LTE versus IEEE 802.11p/WAVE: which technology is able to support cooperative vehicular safety applications?, IEEE Wirel Commun Lett, 1, 2, pp. 125-128, (2012); Lottermann C., Botsov M., Fertl P., Mullner R., Performance evaluation of automotive off-board applications in LTE deployments, (2012); LTE; Service requirements for V2X services (Release 14), (2017); Study on enhancement of 3GPP support for 5G V2X services (Release 15), (2016); Anpalagan A., Bennis M., Vannithamby R., Design and Deployment of Small Cell Networks, (2015); Bennis M., Debbah M., Poor H.V., Ultrareliable and low-latency wireless communication: tail, risk, and scale, Proc IEEE, 106, 10, pp. 1834-1853, (2018); Chen C., Wang B., Zhang R., Interference hypergraph-based resource allocation (IHG-RA) for noma-integrated V2X networks, IEEE Internet Things J, 6, 1, pp. 161-170, (2019); Di B., Song L., Li Y., Han Z., V2X meets noma: nonorthogonal multiple access for 5G-enabled vehicular networks, IEEE Wirel Commun, 24, 6, pp. 14-21, (2017); Masmoudi A., Feki S., Mnif K., Zarai F., Efficient radio resource management for D2D-based LTE-V2X communications, pp. 1-6, (2018); Sun W., Yuan D., Strm E.G., Brannstorm F., Cluster-based radio resource management for D2D-supported safety-critical V2X communications, IEEE Trans Wirel Commun, 15, 4, pp. 2756-2769, (2016); Wang P., Di B., Zhang H., Bian K., Song L., Cellular V2X communications in unlicensed spectrum: harmonious coexistence with vanet in 5G systems, IEEE Trans Wireless Commun, 17, 8, pp. 5212-5224, (2018); Shah S.A.A., Ahmed E., Imran M., Zeadally S., 5G for vehicular communications, IEEE Commun Mag, 56, 1, pp. 111-117, (2018); Campolo C., Molinaro A., Iera A., Menichella F., 5G network slicing for vehicle-to-everything services, IEEE Wirel Commun, 24, 6, pp. 38-45, (2017); Albonda H.D., Prez-Romero J., An efficient RAN slicing strategy for a heterogeneous network with eMBB and V2X services, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 44771-44782, (2019); Campolo C., Molinaro A., Iera A., Fontes R.R., Rothenberg C.E., Towards 5G network slicing for the V2X ecosystem, (2018); Study on architecture enhancements for EPS and 5G system to support advanced V2X services (Release 16), (2018); Rost P., Mannweiler C., Michalopoulos D.S., Et al., Network slicing to enable scalability and flexibility in 5G mobile networks, IEEE Commun Mag, 55, 5, pp. 72-79, (2017); METIS deliverable D7.3 Final 5G visualization, (2017); LTE; Service requirements for V2X services (Release 14), (2017); WINNER II channel models, D1.1.2 V1.0; Karedal J., Czink N., Paier A., Tufvesson F., Molisch A.F., Path loss modeling for vehicle-to-vehicle communications, IEEE Trans Veh Technol, 60, 1, pp. 323-328, (2011); Kreutz D., Ramos F.M.V., Verssimo P.E., Rothenberg C.E., Azodolmolky S., Uhlig S., Software-defined networking: a comprehensive survey, Proc IEEE, 103, 1, pp. 14-76, (2015); von Luxburg U., A tutorial on spectral clustering, (2007); Yuille A.L., Grzywacz N.M., The motion coherence theory, (1988); Khan H., Luoto P., Bennis M., Latva-aho M., On the application of network slicing for 5G-V2X, (2018); Evolved universal terrestrial radio access (E-UTRA) and evolved universal terrestrial radio access network (E-UTRAN), (2017); Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) services based on LTE sidelink; User Equipment (UE) radio transmission and reception; Luoto P., Bennis M., Pirinen P., Samarakoon S., Horneman K., Latva-aho M., Vehicle clustering for improving enhanced LTE-V2X network performance, (2017)","H.

However, it is a big challenge for these formulations to sustainably and stably release pesticide in the soil at the whole process of crop growth. In this paper, based on chemical crosslinking of sulfonic acid group on sodium lignosulfonate (SL) with protonated UIO-66-NH2, we successfully construct a novel double-layer pesticide carrier to achieve the long-term pest control. Besides traditional indoor drug release, this work further investigates the release behavior in the soil column to simulate the outdoor environment. The results of release show that thiamethoxam (TMX)-loaded UIO-66-NH2/SL not only overcomes the shortage of burst release for natural polymer carriers in the soil, but also solves the problem that MOFs-based carrier is released too slowly in the early stage. Specifically, TMX-loaded UIO-66-NH2/SL has excellent biosafety and stability in outdoor environment. As a result, the rice treated by TMX-loaded UIO-66-NH2/SL is not affected by pests within 42 d, and the plant height of rice is up to 41 cm. In contrast, the rice treated by uncoated TMX is affected by pests at 16 d, and the plant height of rice is only 21 cm. Therefore, this study has developed a controlled-release pesticide that is more suitable for practical engineering applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Chemical crosslinking; Controlled-release pesticides; Double-layer drug loading; Pest control; Soil column","Crosslinking; Pest control; Pesticides; Soils; Targeted drug delivery; Chemical cross-linking; Controlled release; Outdoor environment; Polymer carrier; Practical engineering applications; Release behaviors; Sodium lignosulfonates; Sulfonic acid groups; Controlled drug delivery","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51263001, 51863001); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Science and Technology Major Project of Guangxi, (AA18242027); Science and Technology Major Project of Guangxi","This study is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51863001 , 51263001 ), and Science and Technology Major Project of Guangxi (Contract No. AA18242027 ).

In this work we exploit the physical and analytical transparency of a 1.5D model to show that the deposition of thermally expanded material onto an elastic substrate leads to the accumulation of strain incompatibility. This field, which is the source of residual stress in the system, introduces memory of the construction history even in the absence of plastic deformations. The model is then applied to describe the onset and the progression of residual stresses during deposition, their evolution upon cooling, and the fundamental role played by the velocity of the moving heat source. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","Additive manufacturing; Elasticity; Residual stress; Strain incompatibility; Welding","Additives; Deposition; Residual stresses; Welding; Construction history; Elastic substrate; Moving heat sources; Strain incompatibility; Workpiece; 3D printers","","","","","Italian Group of Mathematical Physics; Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica ""Francesco Severi"", INdAM; Gruppo Nazionale per la Fisica Matematica, GNFM; Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR, (CUP-D94I18000260001); Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR; Erasmus+","D.Z. acknokwledges the support by the Erasmus+ Traineeship Programme.

Despite excellent corrosion resistance and mechanical properties, Monel components may fail via wear, which is enhanced in corrosive environment. Heavy components working under high loads may experience galling, which is welding followed by tearing of large pieces of material off the contacting surfaces. In addition to high cost of Ni-based alloys, heavy parts of machinery may not be easily replaced, and, thus, require repair being in partial assembly. In this paper, we introduce wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) technology as a repair method for Monel alloy components. The effect of post-weld heat treatment on microstructure and hardness of both the component body and the repair layer is investigated and discussed. © 2021 Engineers Australia.","Additive manufacturing; microstructure-properties relationship; Ni-base alloys","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Copper alloys; Corrosion resistance; Heat treatment; Iron alloys; Machinery; Manganese alloys; Marine industry; Nickel alloys; Petroleum industry; Titanium alloys; Contacting surfaces; Corrosive environment; Excellent corrosion resistances; Monel alloys; Ni based alloy; Oil extraction industries; Post weld heat treatment; Repair methods; Repair","","","","","Defence Future Capability Technology Centre; Defence Materials Technology Centre; Australian Research Council, ARC, (LE0882613)","This project was financially supported by the Defence Materials Technology Centre (DMTC), which was established under the initiative of Australian Government’s Defence Future Capability Technology Centre (DFCTC).

In this paper, we show that for some sea-state conditions, that are still to be precisely characterized, long ocean waves are responsible for high-frequency (spatial and temporal) coherent Sea Level Anomaly (SLA) signals. It is found that the peak wavelength corresponds to the dominant swell wavelength. Furthermore, the short time lag between S3-A and S3-B acquisitions allows performing cross-spectral analyses that reveal phase shifts consistent with waves travelling according to the wave dispersion relation. It is also demonstrated that the classical 20 Hz sampling frequency is insufficient to properly sample most swell-induced SLA signals and that aliasing can generate errors over the entire frequency spectrum, including at long wavelengths. These results advocate for the use of azimuth oversampling (40 Hz or 80 Hz). Low-pass filtering should be applied prior to any down-sampling to 20 Hz, in order to prevent long-wavelength errors induced by spectral leakage. © 2020 COSPAR","SAR altimetry; Sea surface height spectrum; Sentinel-3 tandem phase; Swell","Low pass filters; Meteorological instruments; Ocean currents; Sea level; Signal sampling; Spectrum analysis; Surface waters; Cross-spectral analysis; Frequency spectra; High frequency HF; Long wavelength errors; Low-pass filtering; Sampling frequencies; Sea level anomaly; Sea surface height; Water waves","","","","","Institut Français de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la Mer, IFREMER; European Space Agency, ESA","Funding text 1: This research was supported by the Sentinel-3 Tandem for Climate (S3TC) ESA project. ; Funding text 2: The authors acknowledge the usefulness of having the L1A SRAL PDGS products available for conducting advanced SAR altimeter investigations like the present study.

Specifically, we propose to leave part of the model uncured during the printing step, and then cure it in the post-processing step to set the shape in a folded configuration. While the cured regions in the first step try to regain their unfolded shape, the regions cured in the second step attempt to keep their folded shape. As a result, the final shape is obtained when both regions’ stresses reach equilibrium. Finite element analysis is performed in ANSYS to obtain the stress distribution on common hinge designs, demonstrating that the square-hinge has a lower maximum principal stress than elliptical and triangle hinges. Based on the square-hinge and rectangular cavity, two variables—the hinge width and the cavity height—are selected as principal variables to construct an empirical model with the final folding angle. In the end, experimental verification shows that the developed method is valid and reliable to realize the proposed deformation and 3D development of 2D hinges. © 2021, The Author(s).","Digital light processing; Elastomer; Hinge design; Origami; Post-curing","Curing; Hinges; Digital light processing; Empirical model; Experimental verification; Hinge designs; Maximum principal stress; Post processing; Principal Variables; Rectangular cavity; 3D printers","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (-2017-06707)","This paper acknowledges the support of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Grant #RGPIN-2017-06707.

With the clinical pathway as the center, the subjective and objective medical knowledge of medical staff are collected, and a clinical pathway management system guided by EBM is established through a unified process; user demand analysis; main considerations; implementation, evaluation, and monitoring of the clinical path; and dictionary maintenance, to help hospitals fully regulate medical behaviors. Next, the study displays the path access prompt box, area 1 management page, table management page, exit prompt box, mutation record page, doctor order interface, revocation of execution, and monitoring interface, and the system designed is compared with the Beijing Shankang Technology (ASK) clinical data management system in terms of user experience. The results showed that the reporting rate of medical adverse events in the system in this study was 0.21%, and the work efficiency was increased by 14%. In terms of users' satisfaction, the hospital managers' satisfaction was 84 ± 5.36%, and it was 95 ± 4.72% for medical staff and 88 ± 4.91% for system administrators, superior to the ASK system; the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). In conclusion, the clinical pathway information management system is in line with the working environment of medical staff, and the synchronous monitoring and management of medical quality are achieved through digital means, which can reduce the occurrence of medical adverse events and improve the work efficiency of medical staff.  © 2021 Xinyu Wang et al.","","Critical Pathways;

The AM technology has demonstrated operational resilience and provided a wide spectrum of on-demand solutions to provide rapid emergency responses and solve supply chains disruptions issues. Present obstacles seen in the battle against COVID-19 may potentially spur into new possibilities for the AM community, standards organisations, and regulatory authorities to collaborate more closely to expedite the progress of this technology. The importance of assurance is rapidly growing on the agenda, and one of the primary problems continues to be a lack of standards and regulations. Nevertheless, regulatory authorities and certification service providers play a critical role in assisting manufacturers to adhere to best practices and getting ahead of the assurance curve to ensure that AM products are safe and reliable. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","3D printing;

It demonstrates applying supervised learning (SL) directly to find the optimal solution, the learning process is guided by the necessary conditions derived from the Pontryagin’s minimum principle. The combination of SL methods and fundamentals of optimal control theory dramatically reduces the dimension of the learning space by exploiting the features of the optimal solution. Based on Hamiltonian and first-order necessary conditions, the optimal solution of the fuel-optimal powered descent guidance (FOPDG) problem is represented by a few critical parameters. Therefore, instead of learning all state and control variables, the proposed approach only needs to learn the identified critical parameters.","","Fuels; Optimal systems; Control variable; First-order necessary conditions; Learning process; Minimum Principles; Onboard guidance; Optimal control methods; Optimal control theory; Optimal solutions; Learning systems","","","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, (80NSSC18K1506); National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA","This research has been supported by NASA grant 80NSSC18K1506, and government sponsorship is acknowledged.

Cloud is a large pool of virtual access resources to perform thousands of computational and storage operations. Task scheduling is an NP-hard problem, unsuitable matching leads to performance degradation and violation of service level agreement (SLA). The growing complexity of cloud services needs an extension of existing scheduling algorithms. In this paper, the scheduling problem has been explored based on growing application trends. Cloud dynamic resource provisioning can satisfy users' requirements if execution of tasks performed: identifying of task requirements; workflow of application scheduling using a sufficient amount of resources. In this research work, we present an intelligent agent technique for optimising resource utilisation named NITCO. NITCO considers the above mentioned challenge, identification of task requirements and configuration of resource. The performance of proposed NITCO has been evaluated on simulated cloud environment and comparison of results show that NITCO performed better in terms of execution cost, execution time, VM utilisation and SLA violation while it delivers quality of service.

In the present work, first, microstructural evolution of the alloys that underwent the direct aging treatment, solution treatment, and solution treatment plus aging are investigated in detail using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM); and second, mechanical properties and electrical conductivity of these samples were measured. After solution treatment, it's found that fine Sn-enriched precipitates resolved in matrix, an abundance of dislocation diminished, the grain size increased and a number of annealing twins formed. Spinodal decomposition could happen during the cooling of solution-treatment. According to the comparison of the microstructure and performance of the printed sample and the solution treated sample after aging, it's concluded that the strength and conductivity of the aged SLM-manufactured samples are higher than that of the aged solution-treatment samples for same aging duration, however, the plasticity and aging strengthening effect is inverted. The sharp decrement of plasticity is mainly ascribed to network discontinuous precipitations (DPs) in the grain boundary, but not the lamellar DPs. Annealing twin boundaries depressed the formation of DPs in the grain boundary, and improved the plasticity of aged solution-treatment samples. Lamellar DPs were also considered to be enhanced the strength of aged samples, besides modulated structures, D022 phase and L12 phase. © 2020","Aging; Cu-15Ni–8Sn alloy; Microstructure; Precipitation; SLM process","Aging of materials; Grain boundaries; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Microstructural evolution; Scanning electron microscopy; Spinodal decomposition; Ageing hardening; Cu-15ni–8sn alloy; Discontinuous precipitation; Effect of ageing; Grain-boundaries; Micro-structural; Microstructure and properties; SLM process; Solution treatments; Precipitation (chemical)","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51271034); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2017YFB0306100)","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51271034 ) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFB0306100 ).","Schwartz L.H., Mahajan S., Plewes J.T., Spinodal decomposition in a Cu-9wt%-Ni-6wt%-Sn alloy, Acta Metall., 22, 5, pp. 601-609, (1974); Plewes J.T., High-strength Cu-Ni-Sn alloys by thermomechanical processing, Metall.

Several spill-return atomizers were compared in terms of the spatial and temporal behaviour of the internal air-core, liquid sheet thickness and its perturbations. The only difference amongst the test configurations was the geometrical arrangement of the spill-line (SL) orifice through which the liquid was spilled away. The flow field inside the swirl chamber was examined using high-speed imaging with image post processing using an in-house Matlab code and three orthogonal velocity components acquired using Laser Doppler Anemometry. The dimensions of the production atomizers did not allow direct visualization of their internal flow, so a scaled, modular, transparent plexiglass model was used. Its flow characteristics were equivalent to the original atomizer. The refractive index of the atomizer body was matched to the test liquid using a solution of 1-Bromonaphthalene and kerosene fuel type JET A-1. The test conditions were derived from the original atomizer and were limited to inlet port Reynolds numbers, from 700 to 2000 and spill-to-feed ratios, SFR, from 0 to 0.75. An inviscid analysis, originally derived for Simplex atomizers, was modified and applied to the spill-return version. This approach allows a theoretical prediction of the discharge coefficient and air-core diameter dependent solely on SFR. An axially located SL orifice inhibits any internal air-core forming in the swirl chamber. Off-axial SL orifices generate and stabilize the air-core, which leads to the regular formation of a liquid sheet and a high-quality spray. Nevertheless, some configurations changed the breakup nature of the liquid sheet and consequently the spray quality. Moreover, the turn-down ratio of the liquid supply rate and spray stability depend on the distance of the SL orifices from the swirl chamber centreline. The flow energy losses increase with SFR. The outcomes from this analysis allow the optimization of the SL configuration for specific application and extend the classical inviscid analysis. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Air-core; Internal flow; Liquid sheet; Spill-return; Temporal stability","Atomization; Atomizers; Energy dissipation; Laser Doppler velocimeters; MATLAB; Orifices; Refractive index; Reynolds number; Direct visualization; Discharge coefficients; Flow charac-teristics; Geometrical arrangements; Laser Doppler anemometry; Pressure swirl atomizers; Test configurations; Velocity components; Liquids","","","","","Grantová Agentura České Republiky, GA ČR, (CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_026/0008392)","The authors acknowledge the financial support from the project No. 18-15839S funded by the Czech Science Foundation and the project “Computer Simulations for Effective Low-Emission Energy Engineering” funded as project No. CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_026/0008392 by Operational Programme Research, Development and Education, Priority axis 1: Strengthening capacity for high-quality research.","Lefebvre A.H., McDonell V.G., Atomization and sprays, (2017); Chinn J.J., Cooper D., Yule A.J., Nasr G.G., Stationary rotary force waves on the liquid–air core interface of a swirl atomizer, Heat Mass Transf., 52, 10, pp. 2037-2050, (2015); Fu Q.-F., Yang L.-J., Qu Y.-Y., Gu B., Linear stability analysis of a conical liquid sheet, J.

In this study, solution-treated Al-10Si-Mg and Al-10Si alloys (mass%) were heat-treated at several temperatures and the linear dimensional changes arising from the heat-treatments were investigated. A theoretical model for calculating the linear dimensional change in Al-Si-Mg ternary alloys was proposed, and the theoretically and the experimentally determined linear dimensional changes were compared. It was found that the linear dimensional changes of Al-10Si-Mg and Al-10Si alloys were almost the same. In both alloys, the linear dimensional changes increased with the decrease of the heat-treatment temperature.

In this paper, a methodology for fabricating parts of heterogeneous internal structure by thermoplastic Material Extrusion (MEX) is proposed. Construction of the corresponding layer deposition paths is performed according to locally-defined material density, encoded in the form of a voxel part model. Specific algorithms for constructing a single layer deposition path by joining elementary deposition paths of semi-random or standard shape are developed and tested. Computational tests of the developed algorithmic procedures indicate that the associated computer processing time, is comparable to that implied by conventional slicing and path planning techniques. Results of fabrication tests employing an open-hardware MEX system further prove the feasibility of the approach. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","3D printing; fused filament fabrication;

For this purpose, a demonstrator geometry with a step-wise increase of the tungsten carbide content in a Ti6Al4V matrix was fabricated. The build cycle itself, the component shape and the microstructure were investigated. The analysis of the macroscopic properties was performed by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. In summary, 3DPMD offers the possibility to produce AM parts at high build rates and increased material flexibility. The analysis of the morphology and the macroscopic investigations shows a homogenous structure without defects. The carbide content of the manufactured components increases continuously from 0 to 12 vol.% but deviates from the aimed carbide content. Using automated CAM routines, it is possible to generate metallic multi-material structures using welding robots directly from the CAD drawings. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","3dpmd; Additive; arc; functionally; graded; manufacturing; mmam; plasma; powder; structure","3D printers; Aluminum alloys; Aluminum metallography; Associative storage; Computer aided design; Deposition; Morphology; Robot applications; Scanning electron microscopy; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Titanium metallography; Tungsten carbide; Vanadium alloys; Vanadium metallography; Component shape; Homogenous structure; Macroscopic properties; Metal deposition; Metallic part; Multi materials; Multi-material structure; Welding robots; Metals","","","","","","","Wang X., Kustov S., van Humbeeck J., Characterization of wire arc additively manufactured titanium aluminide functionally graded material.

However, the gel forming mechanism based only on hydrophilic-hydrophobic interaction renders the stability and mechanical strength of the formed hydrogels insufficient, and cannot meet the requirements of extrusion 3D printing. In this study, cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), which is a kind of rigid, hydrophilic, and biocompatible nanomaterial, were introduced to enhance the hydrogels so as to meet the requirements of extrusion 3D printing. First, a series of poly(ε-caprolactone/lactide)-b-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone/ lactide) (PCLA-PEG-PCLA) triblock copolymers with different molecular weights were prepared. The thermodynamic and rheological properties of CNC-enhanced hydrogels were investigated. The results showed that the addition of CNC significantly improved the thermal stability and mechanical properties of the hydrogels, and within a certain range, the enhancement effect was directly proportional to the concentration of CNC. More importantly, the PCLA-PEG-PCLA hydrogels enhanced by CNC could be extruded and printed through temperature regulation. The printed objects had high resolution and fidelity with effectively maintained structure. Moreover, the hydrogels have good biocompatibility with a high cell viability. Therefore, this is a simple and effective strategy. The addition of the hydrophilic rigid nanoparticles such as CNC improves the mechanical properties of the soft hydrogels which made it able to meet the requirements of 3D bioprinting. © 2021.

However, the accuracy and efficiency of surrogate-based RBDO largely rely on the sample size and sampling methods. For this reason, successive sampling methods that update the surrogate successively are more promising. Nowadays, several Kriging-based RBDO approaches have been proposed with different successive sampling techniques. However, these approaches are based on Monte Carlo simulations and double-loop approaches such that most of them would be time consuming for high target reliability levels or high dimensional problems. To improve the efficiency of surrogate-based RBDO, this article proposes a Single-Loop Approach (SLA) combined with the Kriging surrogate. This Kriging model is updated efficiently by using the Most Probable Points (MPPs) from the last SLA iteration. A very simple and effective stopping criterion is proposed. Compared with other sampling methods, the initial Kriging can be started with very few training points and converges to the right optimum very efficiently. Three mathematical examples and a practical engineering problem are used to demonstrate the effectiveness, the advantages and also the limitations of this method. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptive sampling;

A Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) team successfully produced an aluminum-silicon carbide system with additive manufacturing (AM). The team also demonstrated the ability to grade the metal and ceramic three-dimensionally to form tailored material gradients. This effort merely scratches the surface of what is possible; future advances in AM materials development could result in materials with properties that are currently impossible to achieve with any other manufacturing process.

As SPD manifolds have a non-Euclidean geometry, Euclidean machine learning methods are not directly applicable to them. In this work, an improved covariance descriptor called the hybrid region covariance descriptor (HRCD) is proposed. The HRCD incorporates the mean feature information into the RCD to improve the latter's discriminative performance. To address the non-Euclidean properties of SPD manifolds, this study also proposes an algorithm called the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion subspace learning (HSIC-SL) for SPD manifolds. The HSIC-SL algorithm is aimed at improving classification accuracy. This algorithm is a kernel function that embeds SPD matrices into the reproducing kernel Hilbert space and further maps them to a linear space. To make the mapping consider the correlation between SPD matrices and linear projection, this method introduces global HSIC maximization to the model. The proposed method is compared with existing methods and is proved to be highly accurate and valid by classification experiments on the HRCD and HSIC-SL using the COIL-20, ETH-80, QMUL, face data FERET, and Brodatz datasets.  © 2021 Xi Liu et al.","","Classification (of information); Covariance matrix; Geometry; Image classification; Classification accuracy; Covariance descriptor; Hilbert-schmidt independence criterions; Image representations; Machine learning methods; Non-Euclidean geometry; Reproducing Kernel Hilbert spaces; Symmetric positive definite; Learning systems","","","","","","","Arsigny V., Fillard P., Pennec X., Ayache N., Geometric means in a novel vector space structure on symmetric positive-definite matrices, SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications, 29, 1, pp. 328-347, (2007); Harandi M., Sanderson C., Shen C., Lovell B., Dictionary Learning and Sparse Coding on Grassmann Manifolds: An Extrinsic Solution, pp. 3120-3127; Porikli F., Tuzel O., Meer P., Covariance Tracking Using Model Update Based on Lie Algebra; Wang R., Guo H., Davis L.S., Dai Q., Covariance Discriminative Learning: A Natural and Efficient Approach to Image Set Classification; Wang W., Wang R., Huang Z., Shan S., Chen X., Discriminant analysis on Riemannian manifold of Gaussian distributions for face recognition with image sets, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 27, 1, pp. 151-163, (2017); Dryden I.L., Koloydenko A., Zhou D., Non-Euclidean statistics for covariance matrices, with applications to diffusion tensor imaging, The Annals of Applied Statistics, 3, 3, pp. 1102-1123, (2009); Le Bihan D., O. -F.

Cartilage TE requires the development of functional personalized implants with cartilage-like mechanical properties capable of sustaining high load-bearing environments to integrate into the surrounding tissue of the cartilage defect. In this study, we evaluated the novel 1,4-butanediol thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer (b-TPUe) derivative filament as a 3D bioprinting material with application in cartilage TE. The mechanical behavior of b-TPUe in terms of friction and elasticity were examined and compared with human articular cartilage, PCL, and PLA. Moreover, infrapatellar fat pad-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were bioprinted together with scaffolds. in vitro cytotoxicity, proliferative potential, cell viability, and chondrogenic differentiation were analyzed by Alamar blue assay, SEM, confocal microscopy, and RT-qPCR. Moreover, in vivo biocompatibility and host integration were analyzed. b-TPUe demonstrated a much closer compression and shear behavior to native cartilage than PCL and PLA, as well as closer tribological properties to cartilage. Moreover, b-TPUe bioprinted scaffolds were able to maintain proper proliferative potential, cell viability, and supported MSCs chondrogenesis. Finally, in vivo studies revealed no toxic effects 21 days after scaffolds implantation, extracellular matrix deposition and integration within the surrounding tissue. This is the first study that validates the biocompatibility of b-TPUe for 3D bioprinting. Our findings indicate that this biomaterial can be exploited for the automated biofabrication of artificial tissues with tailorable mechanical properties including the great potential for cartilage TE applications. © 2020 The Authors.

A three-dimensional (3-D) network model is studied to accurately describe characteristics of the coexistence system in the indoor scenario of high-rise centers by utilizing stochastic geometry. First, the medium access probability of a typical SL transmitter or Wi-Fi access point (AP) is derived, and then the average spectral efficiency of an arbitrary device is calculated. Based on the theoretical analysis, a dynamic resource allocation scheme in duty-cycle based access mode is proposed to maximize the coexistence system throughput while guaranteeing fairness. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.  © 1997-2012 IEEE.","3-D unlicensed networks; duty-cycle; SL-U; stochastic geometry","Resource allocation; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Average spectral efficiency; Dynamic resource allocations; Medium access probabilities; Numerical results; Stochastic geometry; Threedimensional (3-d); Unlicensed spectrum; Wi-fi access points; Wi-Fi","","","","","CERNET Innovation Project, (NGIICS20190301); OPPO Standardization Department; State Major Science and Technology Special Projects, (2018ZX03001024)","The work refers to this letter was partially supported by the State Major Science and Technology Special Projects (Grant No.2018ZX03001024), CERNET Innovation Project (NGIICS20190301), and OPPO Standardization Department.","Oh J., Kim Y., Li Y., Bang J., Lee J., Expanding 5G new radio technology to unlicensed spectrum, Proc.

The order of information presentation influences the retrieval of said information; however, there is a need to explore this effect within DfAM. We compared four variations in DfAM education: (1) O-DfAM followed by R-DfAM, (2) R-DfAM followed by O-DfAM, (3) only O-DfAM, and (4) only R-DfAM by evaluating: (1) students’ DfAM self-efficacy, (2) their self-reported DfAM use, and (3) design creativity. All students trained in DfAM demonstrated an increase in R-DfAM self-efficacy; however, only students trained in O-DfAM, with or without R-DfAM, reported an increase in O-DfAM self-efficacy. Furthermore, students trained in R-DfAM first followed by O-DfAM generated more creative ideas. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","creativity; Design education; design for additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Design for manufacturability; Creative ideas; Design creativities; Design freedom; Information presentation; Self efficacy; Students","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CMMI-1712234)","This research was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) [grant number CMMI-1712234].

Specific geometries of unit cells can thus be tailored for particular needs due to recent progress in additive manufacturing techniques. This paper experimentally studies how the grading of the cell unit angle of an auxetic core in a sandwich panel affects its energy absorbing capability and structural response. 3D printed sandwich panels with uniform and graded auxetic cellular core were tested under quasistatic compression. The results show that sandwich panels with graded core exhibit much better energy absorption capabilities with higher plateau stress and densification strain. This indicates that, by appropriately controlling its geometry, auxetic structures can show further potential as core in sandwich panels for energy absorption applications. © 2021 Syscom 18 SRL.

Multi-cloud is a multi-tenant and multi-vendor heterogeneous cloud platform in terms of services and security under a defined SLA (service level agreement). The diverse deployment of the multi-cloud model leads to rise in security risks. In this paper, we define a multi-cloud model with hybridization of vendor and security to increase the end-user experience. The proposed model has a heterogeneous cloud paradigm with a combination of firewall tracts to overcome rising security issues. The proposed work consists of three steps, firstly, all incoming traffic from the consumer end into five major groups called ambient. Secondly, design a next-generation firewall (NGFW) topology with a mixture of tree-based and demilitarized zone (DMZ) implications. Test implementation of designed topology performed by using a simple DMZ technique in case of vendor-specific model and NGFW on hybrid vendor based multi-cloud model. Furthermore, it also defines some advantages of NGFW to overcome these concerns. The proposed work is helpful for the new consumer to define their dynamic secure cloud services under a single SLA before adopting a multi-cloud platform. Finally, results are compared in terms of throughput and CPU utilization in both cases. © 2021 - IOS Press.

Flexible strain sensors with high-performance characteristics as well as highly efficient and cost-effective maskless fabrication methods are the key components of IoT for these applications. Herein, a 3D printing technology using digital light processing is developed to fabricate high-performance flexible strain sensors based on UV-curable multiwalled carbon nanotubes/elastomer (MWCNT/EA) composite. The MWCNT/EA-based device with 2 wt% MWCNTs delivers a sensitivity of 8.939 with a linearity up to 45% strain. Additionally, the sensor has a detectable strain range from 0.01% to 60%, a high mechanical durability (10 000 cycles), and linear responses to humidity and temperature. Numerical simulation and impedance study indicate that the sensor works on the deformation-induced reduction of MWCNT conductive pathway. The developed device can be used to detect various external deformation, when combined with a near-field communication circuit. Moreover, a 4 × 4 strain sensor array is developed for sensing external stimuli distribution, further demonstrating the high performance of the 3D printed device. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","3D printing; external stimuli detection; flexible stain sensors; multiwalled carbon nanotubes","3D printers; Cost effectiveness; Curing; Deformation; Internet of things; Nanotubes; Near field communication; Structural health monitoring; Digital light processing; High performance characteristics; Human motion detection; Humidity and temperatures; Internet of Things (IOT); Maskless fabrication; Mechanical durability; Printing technologies; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN)","","","","","Ministry of Education of China for Equipment Preresearch, (6141A02022136); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51705154, 51835003, 61804054); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFB1105400); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC; Shanghai Rising-Star Program, (18QA1401300); Shanghai Rising-Star Program; Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning","This project was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2018YFB1105400), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51705154, 51835003, and 61804054), Joint Fund of Ministry of Education of China for Equipment Preresearch (Grant No. 6141A02022136), the Shanghai Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning, and Shanghai Rising Star Program (A type) (Grant No. 18QA1401300).

Advantages over conventional welding include a much lower heat input and minimal dilution, also surpassing metal spraying due to the resulting metallurgical bond. In this paper, the effect of laser cladding on the fatigue life of a 70 mm diameter component of wrought quenched and tempered AISI-SAE 4140H is assessed, along with full characterization of defects, hardness and residual stress distributions. Additionally, a theoretical fatigue crack propagation prediction model based on a fracture mechanics approach is demonstrated to provide acceptable estimated fatigue lives, and shows how the most influential process variables affect these results. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Fatigue estimation; High cycle fatigue; Laser additive manufacturing; Metallic cladding","3D printers; Additives; Fatigue crack propagation; Laser cladding; Predictive analytics; Repair; Additive manufacturing process; Fracture mechanics approach; Laser additive manufacturing; Mechanical components; Metal spraying; Metallurgical bonds; Process Variables; Steel components; Fatigue of materials","","","","","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, CONICET; Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica, ANPCyT","Authors wish to express their gratitude to the funding provided by CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas), and by Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica (ANPCyT), Argentina (PICT 2017 Nro. 0982).","Zhu Y., Yang Y., Mu X., Wang W., Yao Z., Yang H., Study on wear and RCF performance of repaired damage railway wheels: Assessing laser cladding to repair local defects on wheels, Wear, 430-431, pp. 126-136, (2019); Sun S.D., Liu Q., Brandt M., Luzin V., Cottam R., Janardhana M., Et al., Effect of laser clad repair on the fatigue behaviour of ultra-high strength AISI 4340 steel, Mater Sci Engng, A, 606, pp. 46-57, (2014); Paydas H., Mertens A., Carrus R., Lecomte-Beckers J., Tchoufang T.J., Laser cladding as repair technology for Ti–6Al–4V alloy: Influence of building strategy on microstructure and hardness, Mater Des, 85, pp. 497-510, (2015); McDonough J.R., A perspective on the current and future roles of additive manufacturing in process engineering, with an emphasis on heat transfer, Thermal Science and Engineering Progress, 19, (2020); Mendez P.F., Barnes N., Bell K., Borle S.D., Gajapathi S.S., Guest S.D., Izadi H., Gol A.K., Wood G., Welding processes for wear resistant overlays, J Manuf Processes, 16, 1, pp. 4-25, (2014); Kou S., Yang Y.K., Fusion-boundary Macrosegregation in Dissimilar-Filler Metal Welds, Welding Journal, 86, 10, (2007); (2008); Ashby M.F., Materials Selection in Mechanical Design.

In this article, we present a computationally efficient numerical model based on a sequentially coupled Finite Element Method (FEM) and Streamline Upwind Finite Element Method (SU-FEM)-Finite Difference Method (FDM). An adaptive timestep strategy is implemented which allows computationally efficient and stable solutions as time progresses. The computational efficiency of the formulation is demonstrated by four examples that consider nonuniform permeability, multiple injection wells, an upsloping aquifer, and a dome-shaped aquifer. The adaptive timesteps reduce the computational cost by 75-82% compared to constant timesteps in the four examples considered. The proposed formulation is compared against a benchmark study where eleven different simulators were used to determine the arrival time of the CO2 plume at a leaky well. The original benchmark study did not include an FEM-based discretization of the reduced order equations. To the authors’ best knowledge, the current work is the first FEM based implementation of reduced order (vertically averaged) multiphase flow equations evaluated against this benchmark. The proposed formulation is in good general agreement with the results from the various simulators studied in the benchmark, and excellent agreement with an FDM discretization of the vertically averaged governing equations. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","adaptive timestep; carbon sequestration; CO<sub>2</sub> injection; coupled solution; finite element method; Multiphase flow; plume migration; reduced order model; stabilized finite element method; streamline upwind","Aquifers; Carbon; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Computational efficiency; Finite difference method; Hydrogeology; Numerical methods; Carbon sequestration; Carbon sequestration models; Computational costs; Computationally efficient; Coupled finite element method; Deep saline aquifers; Finitedifference methods (FDM); Governing equations; Finite element method","","","","","Network of Centres of Excellence - Carbon Management Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","The authors would like to acknowledge funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) and NSERC - Network of Centres of Excellence - Carbon Management Canada.","Bachu S., Sequestration of CO<sub>2</sub> in geological media: criteria and approach for site selection in response to climate change, Energy Convers.

Firstly, GA is used to optimize the resonance parameters so that the signal can reach the optimal resonance and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be improved. Secondly, FDM is used to process the signal and the appropriate frequency band function is selected for reconstruction. Finally, Hilbert envelope demodulation analysis was performed on the reconstructed signal to obtain the fault characteristics from the envelope spectrum. In order to prove the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, comparative experiments are designed by using the simulated signal and the measured swing signal of a hydropower unit. The results show that this method can effectively remove the noise interference and improve the SNR and extract the characteristic frequency of the signal, which has the extensive engineering application value to the fault diagnosis of hydropower units.  © 2021 Yan Ren et al.","","Circuit resonance;

This paper integrates Langelaar’s AM filter into the Smooth-Edged Material Distribution for Optimizing Topology (SEMDOT) algorithm—a new element-based topology optimization method capable of forming smooth boundaries—to obtain print-ready designs without introducing post-processing methods for smoothing boundaries before fabrication and adding extra support structures during fabrication. The effects of different build orientations and critical overhang angles on self-supporting topologies are demonstrated by solving several compliance minimization (stiffness maximization) problems. In addition, a typical compliant mechanism design problem—the force inverter design—is solved to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the combination between SEMDOT and Langelaar’s AM filter. © 2020 by the authors.

Scaffolds require both high biocompatibility and tissue-dependent mechanical strength to function as basis for tissue-engineered implants. Thus, natural hydrogels such as fibrin are promising but their rapid biofabrication remains challenging. Printing of low viscosity and slow polymerizing solutions with good spatial resolution can be achieved by freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels (FRESH) bioprinting of cell-laden natural hydrogels. In this study, fibrin and hyaluronic acid were used as single components as well as blended ink mixtures for the FRESH bioprinting. Rheometry revealed that single materials were less viscous than the blended bioink showing higher values for viscosity over a shear rate of 10–1000 s−1. While fibrin showed viscosities between 0.1624 and 0.0017 Pa·s, the blended ink containing fibrin and hyaluronic acid were found to be in a range of 0.1–1 Pa·s. In 3D vascularization assays, formation of vascular structures within the printed constructs was investigated indicating that the printing process did not harm cells and allowed formation of vasculature comparable to moulded control samples. Best values for vascularization were achieved in bioinks consisting of 1.0% fibrin-0.5% hyaluronic acid. The vascular structure area and length were three times higher compared to other tested bioinks, and structure volume as well as number of branches revealed almost four times higher values. In this study, we combined the benefits of the FRESH printing technique with in vitro vascularization, showing that it is possible to achieve a mechanically stable small-scale hydrogel construct incorporating vascular network formation. © The Author(s) 2021.","3D printing; angiogenesis; fibrinogen; FRESH method; hyaluronic acid; vascularization","Bioprinting; Hydrogels; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; Biocompatibility; Cell engineering; Hyaluronic acid; Hydrogels; Organic acids; Printing presses; Scaffolds (biology); Tissue; Viscosity; hydrogel; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Angiogenesis; Bioprinting; Embeddings; Fibrinogen; Freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogel method; Freeforms; Hyaluronic acid; Vascularization; Article; bioprinting; cell culture; cell function; cell isolation; cell proliferation; cell viability; computer aided design; controlled study; fibroblast; flow measurement; freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogel bioprinting; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; nanofabrication; polymerization; scanning electron microscopy; tissue engineering; two-dimensional imaging; vascularization; viscosity; hydrogel; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; 3D printers","","Hydrogels, ","Biobots 2 3D printer; SolidWorks 2016, Dassault","Dassault","IZKF Aachen; Interdisciplinary Centre for Clinical Research; RWTH University Hospital; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (JO 764/4-1+2); Universidade de Lisboa, ULisboa","Funding text 1: We thank the Clinic for Gynaecology and Obstetrics and the Clinic for Dermatology and Allergology, RWTH University Hospital, for providing the umbilical cords and the dermal tissue.

To manufacture a part with this technology, the path planning strategy used is the 2.5D. This strategy consists in slicing a 3D model into different planar layers parallel to each other. The use of this strategy limits the complexity of the topologies achievable in WAAM, especially those with large variations in curvature. It also involves several start/stops of the arc as it passes from one layer to another, which induces transient phenomena in which the control of the supply of energy and matter is complex. In this article, a new manufacturing strategy to minimize the start/stop phases of the arc to one unique cycle is presented. The goal of this strategy, called “Continuous Three-dimensional Path Planning” (CTPP) is to generate a continuous trajectory in spiral form for closed-loop thin parts. An adaptive wire speed coupled with a constant travel speed allows a modulation of the deposition geometry that ensures a continuous supply of energy and material throughout the manufacturing process. Using the 5-axis strategy coupled with CTPP allows the manufacture of closed parts with a procedure to determine the optimum closing area and parts on non-planar substrates useful for adding functionalities to an existing structure. Two geometries based on continuous manufacturing with WAAM technology are presented to validate this approach. The manufacturing of these parts with CTPP and several numerical evaluations have shown the reliability of this strategy and its capacity to produce complex new shapes with a good geometrical restitution, difficult or impossible to reach today using 2.5D with WAAM technology. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","5-axis strategy; Closed parts; Geodesic distance; Toolpath generation; Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM)","3D modeling; Additives; Geometry; Substrates; Thin walled structures; Wire; Adding functionality; Continuous manufacturing; Deposition geometry; Manufacturing process; Manufacturing strategy; Non-planar substrates; Planning strategies; Transient phenomenon; 3D printers","","","","","","","Williams S.W., Addison A.C., Martina F., Pardal G., Ding J., Colegrove P., Wire + arc additive manufacturing, Mater.

In this coupled model, the discrete element method (DEM) is utilised to build the superstructure of the ballast track (i.e. rail, fastener, sleeper and ballast layer), which considers the complex ballast shape and particle size distribution from mesoscopic level. The finite difference method (FDM) is used to simulate the substructure (i.e. subgrade and foundation) with a consideration of computing cost. And then, the coupled model is achieved by satisfying displacement, velocity and contact force compatibility between the FLAC and the PFC. Finally, the dynamic analysis is carried out by applying the wheel-rail forces obtained from a vehicle-track dynamics model into the coupled model. The DEM parameters of ballast particles are calibrated based on the results of the ballast direct shear tests, and the dynamic behaviour of railway ballast track and subgrade system is validated with the field measurement. Through the numerical analysis, it is confirmed that the coupled DEM/FDM model can reliably reflect macro-meso dynamic behaviour and accurately reveal the contact characteristics between the ballast layer and subgrade. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","coupled model; discrete element method; field test; finite difference method; Railway ballast track; subgrade","Finite difference method; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Railroad tracks; Railroads; Rails; Vehicle wheels; Contact characteristics; Coupled modeling; Field test; Finitedifference methods (FDM); Moving wheel loads; Railway ballasts; subgrade; Subgrade and foundation; Ballast (railroad track)","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51578469, U1234209); Dalian University of Technology, DUT; State Key Laboratory of Traction Power, (2015TPL-T12, TPL2009); Project 211, (B16041)","This research is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 51578469 and U1234209]; Chinese Program of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities (111 Project, Grant No. B16041) and State Key Laboratory of Traction Power [grant number 2015TPL-T12 and TPL2009].

Numerical simulations are acknowledged as a promising alternative to experiments, and can improve the understanding of the complex process behaviour. In the present work, we propose a simulation-based approach to study and characterise molten metal melt pool oscillatory behaviour during arc welding. We implement a high-fidelity three-dimensional model based on the finite-volume method that takes into account the effects of surface deformation on arc power-density and force distributions. These factors are often neglected in numerical simulations of welding and additive manufacturing. Utilising this model, we predict complex molten metal flow in melt pools and associated melt-pool surface oscillations during both steady-current and pulsed-current gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). An analysis based on a wavelet transform was performed to extract the time-frequency content of the displacement signals obtained from numerical simulations. Our results confirm that the frequency of oscillations for a fully penetrated melt pool is lower than that of a partially penetrated melt pool with an abrupt change from partial to full penetration. We find that during transition from partial to full penetration state, two dominant frequencies coexist in the time-frequency spectrum. The results demonstrate that melt-pool oscillations profoundly depend on melt-pool shape and convection in the melt pool, which in turn is influenced by process parameters and material properties. The present numerical simulations reveal the unsteady evolution of melt pool oscillatory behaviour that are not predictable from published theoretical analyses. Additionally, using the proposed simulation-based approach, the need of triggering the melt-pool oscillations is expendable since even small surface displacements are detectable, which are not sensible to the current measurement devices employed in experiments. © 2020 The Author(s)","Free surface oscillation; Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW); Melt pool behaviour; Melt pool stability","3D printers; Additives; Finite volume method; Gas metal arc welding; Lakes; Liquid metals; Numerical models; Tungsten; Wavelet transforms; Frequency of oscillation; Gas tungsten arc welding; Manufacturing procedure; Pulsed current gas tungsten arc welding; Simulation based approaches; Small surface displacements; Three-dimensional model; Time-frequency spectrum; Gas welding","","","","","Materials innovation institute M2i; Stichting voor Fundamenteel Onderzoek der Materie, FOM; Technische Universiteit Delft, TU Delft; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO; Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter, FOM; Materials innovation institute, M2i","Funding text 1: This research was carried out under project number F31.7.13504 in the framework of the Partnership Program of the Materials innovation institute M2i (www.m2i.nl) and the Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter (FOM) (www.fom.nl), which is part of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (www.nwo.nl).

Unlike traditional ones made of elastomers doped with conductive components or fabricated with liquid conductors, ionically conductive hydrogel-based strain sensors remain conductive under large deformations and are biocompatible. However, dehydration is a challenging issue for the latter. Researchers have developed hydrogel-elastomer-based strain sensors where an elastomer matrix encapsulates a hydrogel circuit to prevent its dehydration. However, the reported multi-step approaches are generally time-consuming. Our group recently reported a multimaterial 3D printing approach that enables fast fabrication of such sensors, yet requires a self-built digital-light-processing-based multimaterial 3D printer. Here, we report a simple projection lithography method to fabricate hydrogel-elastomer-based stretchable strain sensors within 5 minutes. This method only requires a UV projector/lamp with photomasks; the chemicals are commercially available; the protocols for preparing the polymer precursors are friendly to users without chemistry background. Moreover, the manufacturing flexibility allows users to readily pattern the sensor circuit and attach the sensor to a 3D printed soft pneumatic actuator to enable strain sensing on the latter. The proposed approach paves a simple and versatile way to fabricate hydrogel-elastomer-based stretchable strain sensors and flexible electronic devices. © 2021 The Author(s).

Single Point Incremental Forming (SPIF) is a metal sheet forming process used for rapid prototyping applications and small batch production. This work is dedicated to the investigation of the profile geometry and thickness evolution of a truncated pyramid. The influence of process parameters during a SPIF process is also studied. A numerical response surface methodology with a Design of Experiments (DOE) is used to improve the thickness reduction and the effects of the springback. A set of 16 tests are performed by varying four parameters: tool diameter, forming angle, sheet thickness, and tool path. The Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman (GTN) damage model is used to analyze the damage evolution during material deformation. It is found that the model can effectively predict the geometrical profile and thickness with an error of less than 4%. Furthermore, it is noticed that the forming angle is the most influential parameter on the thickness reduction and springback level. Finally, the damage evolution is demonstrated to be sensitive to the forming angle. © 2021 EDP Sciences.","Damage evolution; FE simulation; Response surface methodology; Sheet thickness; Single point incremental forming (SPIF); Springback","Design of experiments; Metal forming; Surface properties; Incremental sheet forming; Influence of process parameters; Manufacturing components; Material deformation; Rapid prototyping applications; Response surface methodology; Single point incremental forming; Small batch production; Sheet metal","","","","","","","Hagan E., Jeswiet J., A review of conventional and modern single-point sheet metal forming methods, Proc.

The price of 3D printing equipment is expensive, and there are some security risks in the process of learning operation. This paper mainly introduces the development and process research of high-temperature environmental protection metal 3D printing equipment and realizes the design of 3D printing equipment combined with virtual reality technology. In this paper, the whole system of 3D printing equipment is designed and built. The function of motion platform and substrate in mechanical system is analyzed, and the detailed structure design is carried out; the control principle of control system including motion control system and temperature control system is introduced in detail, and the corresponding design and construction work is carried out. In this paper, the pure tin wire with low melting point was used as the experimental material, and the mechanical properties and microstructure of the metal tin forming parts were analyzed. On the basis of tin formation experiment, metal deposition experiment and metal forming error experiment were carried out with H65 high melting copper wire as the raw material. The experimental results show that when the printing speed is 35/mm, the dimensional accuracy of the products is high; the microhardness of the printed tin is close to that of the original material, the surface hardness is 12.50HV0.05, and that of the copper alloy is 14.31HV0.05; the tensile strength of tin wire after melt deposition is slightly reduced after tensile test for the machined tin parts, the ultimate tensile strength of the first group of specimens is reduced by 1.58%, and that of the second group is reduced by 0.74%. This paper combines virtual reality technology with 3D printing technology and develops 3D printing equipment for high-temperature environmental protection metal using virtual reality technology. The forming and printing performance of the device is analyzed theoretically and experimentally. The experimental results verify the feasibility of the system and the practicability of the device. © 2021 Jiaofei Huo and Guangpeng Zhang.","","Control systems; Copper alloys; Deposition; Engineering education; Environmental protection; Environmental technology; Learning systems; Machine design; Metal forming; Metal testing; Motion control; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Tin; Virtual reality; Wire products; Design and construction; Dimensional accuracy; Experimental materials; Printing performance; Properties and microstructures; Traditional learning; Ultimate tensile strength; Virtual reality technology; 3D printers","","","","","","","Compton B.G., Lewis J.A., 3D-printing of lightweight cellular composites, Advanced Materials, 26, 34, pp. 5930-5935, (2015); Hong S., Sycks D., Chan H.F., 3D printing: 3D printing of highly stretchable and tough hydrogels into complex, cellularized structures (adv.

Such a high-energy absorption ability originates from the bend-dominated deformation mode of the 3D-architecture as well as the fully-annealed homogeneous microstructure of equiaxed grains, which collectively lead to remarkable strain hardening upon deformation.

The UFMC technique provides better performance against synchronization errors which has been compared with the OFDM scheme [4]. Technique using a single carrier to transmit overall data is called a single carrier modulation. Battery power consumption and range extensions are main goals of giving preference to this method. To achieve high spectral efficiency in the single carrier method, complex equalizers are required. On the other hand, a multi-carrier modulation transforms a wideband single carrier into several orthogonal subcarriers. Visible light communication systems are required for the multi-carrier modulation to increase data transmission [5]. The main purpose of this paper is not only to introduce and compare the best multicarrier waveforms candidate in general, but also to investigate a new hybrid technique consisting of a combination of the selected-mapping method and discrete Hartley transform precoding for the UFMC system (SLM-DHT-P-UFMC) for PAPR reduction in the UFMC system. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: section 2 reports a concise description of the OFDM system. A brief description of the UFMC system is presented in section 3. While PAPR is defined in section 4, section 5 shows a brief description of the proposed hybrid system. Then, in section 6, simulation results and discussion are introduced. Finally, a summary is reported in section 7. Universal filtered multi-carrier (UFMC) is being studied as the favourable waveforms supporting the visible light communication broadcasting systems. However, the UFMC system faces a serious performance degradation on the transmitter side due to its high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). High PAPR of the signal is an analytical intention parameter for mobile networks, and it is necessary to minimize it as much as possible. This paper focuses on the PAPR reduction of the UFMC scheme. An efficient hybrid method of the PAPR reduction has been proposed and analysed through the Matlab™ simulation. The proposed hybrid scheme consists of a mixture of the selected-mapping method and the discrete Hartley transform precoding for a UFMC system (SLM-DHT-P-UFMC). The simulation results show that the proposed hybrid system has a better PAPR reduction performance compared to traditional SLM-UFMC and DHT-P-UFMC systems. Hence, SLM-DHT-P-UFMC is considered to be the suggested scheme in visible light communication broadcasting systems. © 2021 The Author(s).","Discrete Hartley transform precoding; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Peak-to-average power ratio; Selected-mapping; Universal filtered multi-carrier","Carrier communication; Frequency domain analysis; Hybrid systems; Light; Mapping; Visible light communication; Discrete hartley transform precoding; Discrete Hartley transforms; Multi carrier systems; Multicarriers; Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing; Peak-to-average power ratio reductions; Peakto-average power ratios (PAPR); Precoding; Selected mapping; Universal filtered multi-carrier; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","","","","","","","Mohammed N.

It has been established that many TMCs are polymorphic that can exist in different crystal structures and correspondingly exhibit diverse physical properties. Discovery of new structural phases of a crystal is of great scientific and practical importance. In this work, we report a new polymorph of SL-TMC, i.e. SL-Mo5Te8, attained by molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). Like the 1H-MoTe2, it possesses the hexagonal symmetry but a much larger unit cell with a basis containing as many as 39 atoms (15 Mo and 24 Te). We call it the variational hexagonal (v1H) phase. Coincidently, it may be viewed also as one containing the highest density possible of mirror-twin domain boundaries (MTBs) in an otherwise pristine 1H-MoTe2. Electronically, it is metallic and a comparison between theory and experiments of its density-of-states (DOS) at the Fermi level reveals features pointing to an importance of electron interactions that invites further investigations. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd","MBE; Polymorphism; STM; Transition-metal chalcogenides; Two-dimensional materials","Chalcogenides; Crystals; Molecular beam epitaxy; Density of state; Electron interaction; Hexagonal symmetry; Intensive research; Practical importance; Structural phasis; Transition metal chalcogenides; Two Dimensional (2 D); Transition metals","","","","","","","Voiry D, Mohite A, Chhowalla M, Phase engineering of transition metal dichalcogenides, Chem.

However, the peculiar mechanical properties of additively manufactured materials limit the accuracy of structural analyses. In this research, a strategy for the implementation of thickness dependent anisotropy into finite element shell models is developed by example of laser sintered polyamide. The material behaviour was modelled by fitting parametric functions to experimental data. Subsequently, a routine was developed to map the adaptive material properties into a finite element model of a complex component. Numeric simulations with standard and mapped properties were compared and validated via experiments. Results show that the proposed approach is superior to the conventional method in predicting the structural response. The method is not only applicable to laser sintered polymers but relevant for all structures, where anisotropy and thickness must be considered. © 2021 The Author(s).

The results showed that the oxidation kinetics of all samples followed the parabolic time dependence. The microstructural study revealed the formation of very similar oxide scales in both AF and HT conditions. The oxide surface was found to be a mixture of complex spinel-MnCr2O4 and rutile-TiO2 phases. The cross-sectional view yielded an outer layer of protective Cr2O3 scale, an inner layer of Nb-rich Ti0.67Nb1.33O4 oxide and discretely formed internal Al2O3 oxides. The mechanism of scale formation is suggested on the basis of thermodynamic and kinetic abilities of cationic species. © 2021 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.","Additive manufacturing; epitaxial solidification; gas tungsten arc welding; heat-treatment; high-temperature oxidation; Inconel 718; Ni-based superalloys; wire-arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Chromium compounds; Kinetics; Niobium oxide; Oxide minerals; Scale (deposits); Superalloys; Titanium dioxide; Additive manufacturing process; Cationic species; High temperature; Inconel 718 alloy; Inconel 718 superalloys; Micro-structural; Oxidation kinetics; Time dependence; Thermooxidation","","","","","Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO; University of Wollongong, UOW","The authors acknowledge the financial support from University of Wollongong (UOW) and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), respectively.

Additionally, deployment of one-bit Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) has emerged as an important topic in array processing, as it offers both a low-cost and a low-complexity implementation. In this paper, we study the problem of DoA estimation from one-bit measurements received by an SLA. Specifically, we first investigate the identifiability conditions for the DoA estimation problem from one-bit SLA data and establish an equivalency with the case when DoAs are estimated from infinite-bit unquantized measurements. Towards determining the performance limits of DoA estimation from one-bit quantized data, we derive a pessimistic approximation of the corresponding Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB). This pessimistic CRB is then used as a benchmark for assessing the performance of one-bit DoA estimators. We also propose a new algorithm for estimating DoAs from one-bit quantized data. We investigate the analytical performance of the proposed method through deriving a closed-form expression for the covariance matrix of the asymptotic distribution of the DoA estimation errors and show that it outperforms the existing algorithms in the literature. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the analytical derivations and corroborate the resulting performance improvement.  © 1991-2012 IEEE.","Cramér-Rao bound (CRB); direction of arrival (DoA) estimation; one-bit quantization; performance analysis; Sparse linear arrays","Analog to digital conversion; Benchmarking; Covariance matrix; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Direction of arrival; Analog to digital converters; Direction of arrival estimation; Estimation problem; Identifiability conditions; Low-costs; Lower complexity; Performance; Source signals; Sparse linear arrays; Uncorrelated sources; Array processing","","","","","Illinois Discovery Partners Institute; Department of Primary Industries, DPI; European Research Council, ERC; National Science Foundation, NSF, (742648, , 1704401, 1809225); National Science Foundation, NSF; , (1809225, 1704401); ; Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg, FNR, (11228830); Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg, FNR","This work was supported in part by the Luxembourg National Research Fund under the ACCORDION (ref: 11228830), in part by SPRINGER projects, in part by European Research Council under Grant AGNOSTIC (ID: 742648), in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grants 1704401 and 1809225, and in part by an Illinois Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) Seed Award.","Van Trees H., Optimum Array Processing (Detection, Estimation, and Modulation Theory, Part IV), (2002); Haykin S.S., Litva J., Shepherd T.J., Radar Array Processing, (1993); Ottersten B., Array processing for wireless communications, Proc. 8th Workshop Stat.

Efficient allocation of tasks is a crucial process in cloud computing due to the restricted number of resources/virtual machines. IaaS is one of the models of this technology that handles the backend where servers, data centers, and virtual machines are managed. Cloud Service Providers should ensure high service delivery performance in such models, avoiding situations such as hosts being overloaded or underloaded as this will result in higher execution time or machine failure, etc. Task Scheduling highly contributes to load balancing, and scheduling tasks much adheres to the requirements of the Service Level Agreement (SLA), a document offered by cloud developers to users. Important SLA parameters such as Deadline are addressed in the LB algorithm. The proposed algorithm is aimed to optimize resources and improve Load Balancing in view of the Quality of Service (QoS) task parameters, the priority of VMs, and resource allocation. The proposed LB algorithm addresses the stated issues and the current research gap based on the literature's findings.

Studies pertaining to these coupled oscillators are often performed by studying the effect of various coupling parameters on their mutual interaction. However, the effect of system parameters (i.e., the amplitude and frequency) on the coupled interaction of such LCO has not yet received much attention, despite their practical importance. In this paper, we investigate the dynamical behavior of time-delay coupled Stuart–Landau (SL) oscillators exhibiting subcritical Hopf bifurcation for the variation of amplitude and frequency of these oscillators in their uncoupled state. For identical SL oscillators, a gradual increase in the amplitude of LCO shrinks the amplitude death regions observed between the regions of in-phase and anti-phase synchronization leading to its eventual disappearance, resulting in the occurrence of phase-flip bifurcations at higher amplitudes of LCO. We also observe an alternate existence of in-phase and anti-phase synchronization regions for higher values of time delay, whose prevalence of occurrence increases with an increase in the frequency of the oscillator. With the introduction of frequency mismatch, the region of amplitude death. The forced response of SL oscillator shows an asymmetry in the Arnold tongue and the manifestation of asynchronous quenching of LCO. An increase in the amplitude of LCO narrows the Arnold tongue and reduces the region of asynchronous quenching observed in the system. Finally, we compare the coupled and forced response of SL oscillators with the corresponding experimental results obtained from laminar thermoacoustic oscillators and the numerical results from van der Pol (VDP) oscillators. We show that the SL model qualitatively displays many features observed experimentally in coupled and forced thermoacoustic oscillators. In contrast, the VDP model does not capture most of the experimental results due to the limitation in the independent variation of system parameters. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Amplitude death; Asynchronous quenching; Stuart–Landau and van der Pol oscillators; Synchronization; Thermoacoustic oscillator","Hopf bifurcation; Oscillators (mechanical); Quenching; Thermoacoustics; Time delay; Anti-phase synchronization; Coupled interaction; Coupled oscillators; Coupling parameters; Limit-cycle oscillators; Practical importance; Science and engineering; Subcritical Hopf bifurcation; Synchronization","","","","","J.

It additionally determines the optimal degree of postponement, as represented by the so-called customer order decoupling point (CODP), while assuming uncertainty in demand for multiple products. To this end, we propose here the formulation of a generic supply chain through an oriented graph that represents all the deployable alternative technologies, which are defined through a set of operations that are characterised by lead times and cost parameters. Based on this graph, we develop a mixed integer two-stage stochastic programme that finds the optimal manufacturing technology for meeting each market’s demand, each operation’s optimal production quantity, and each selected technology’s optimal CODP. We also present and analyse a case study for introducing additive manufacturing technologies. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","3D printing; additive manufacturing; Manufacturing; postponement; stochastic programming; supply chain strategy","3D printers; Additives; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Additive manufacturing technology; Alternative technologies; Customer order decoupling point; Manufacturing technologies; Optimal manufacturing; Optimal production quantity; Supply chain network design; Two-stage stochastic programming; Integer programming","","","","","Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO","This work was developed under an Accenture Open Innovation University Grant I-01326 and was also partially supported by grant RTI2018-097580-B-I00 of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain.

The proposed array geometry named vertical synthetic planar array (VSPA) consists of an arbitrary SLA on the x-axis and a series of its time-shifted arrays in the vertical orientation. With the original linear array and the moving trail known, the difference coarray of VSPA can be easily obtained. By utilizing both the synthetic aperture processing and the coarray technique, VSPA has the ability to construct a synthetic planar array with only an SLA used. Compared with the traditional sparse planar arrays (SPAs), such as 2D nested array and 2D coprime array, VSPA can achieve higher degree-of-freedom and improved 2D DOA estimation performance with the same number of sensors. Moreover, as different original linear arrays and moving trails can be chosen for different applications, the construction of VSPA is of high flexibility. Numerical simulations are presented to verify the superiority of the proposed VSPA geometry over other typical SPAs.  © 2013 IEEE.","Difference coarray; DOA estimation; sparse planar array; synthetic aperture; vertical motion","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Synthetic apertures; 2-D DOA estimation; Degree of freedom; Direction of arrivalestimation(DOA); High flexibility; Sparse linear arrays; Synthetic aperture processing; Two Dimensional (2 D); Vertical motions; Direction of arrival","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61801024); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61801024.","Li J., Stoica P., MIMO Radar Signal Processing, (2008); Krim H., Viberg M., Two decades of array signal processing research: The parametric approach, IEEE Signal Process.

While the introduction of Additive Manufacturing, better known as 3D printing, in the construction sector has been slower than in other areas, an acceleration is however underway, driven by the promise that this technological innovation brings with it, with potential benefits, both in terms of the construction process and the environment. Research efforts on the development of additive machines and printable materials are making it possible to move from a dimension of experimentation and prototyping to one of construction. The benefits related to 3D printing in terms of reducing the ecological and energy footprint of buildings are numerous and validated.

Since reproducibility of 3-D printed concrete is lower than that of conventional fabrication, each 3-D printed structure should be monitored for proper curing. Conventional qualification of concrete is based on several tests, including destructive compressive strength measurements. Because a structure is 3-D printed layer-by-layer, the surfaces of AM concrete structures have significant surface roughness. This limits the applicability of conventional nondestructive testing methods. We investigated qualification of 3-D printed mortar by monitoring curing with nondestructive electrical conductivity measurements. Bulk resistance of concrete was extracted from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements made using custom flexible self-adhesive electrodes, which contour to rough surfaces. We show that bulk resistivity of concrete increases linearly with time. This allows for developing a calibration curve for compressive strength lookup from nondestructive electrical conductivity measurements. Conductivity measurements also allow for estimation of formation factor, which is an indicator of mortar permeability.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Building materials; electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS); material manufacturing; material properties; mortar","Adhesives; Compressive strength; Concrete industry; Concretes; Curing; Electric conductivity; Electric conductivity measurement; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Mortar; Nondestructive examination; Surface roughness; Calibration curves; Compressive strength measurements; Conductivity measurements; Electrical conductivity measurements; Nondestructive testing method; Printed structures; Reproducibilities; Significant surfaces; 3D printers","","","","","Nuclear Energy Science and Technology Laboratory-Directed Research and Development; Laboratory Directed Research and Development, LDRD, (DE-AC02–06CH11357); Laboratory Directed Research and Development, LDRD","Manuscript received June 23, 2020; revised January 25, 2021; accepted March 3, 2021.

The objective of this study is to explain the design method based on BEM theory for 0.2 m blade rotors with constant, variable, and linear chord with twisted blade geometry. MATLAB and Xfoil programs were used to apply BEM principles on wind turbines with SG6043 airfoil. Numerical and experimental studies were carried out to examine the impact of rotor solidity values from 0.057 to 0.207 and the number of blades from 3 to 7. The experimental blades were developed using a 3D printing additive manufacturing technique. The rotors were investigated in an open wind tunnel at wind speeds ranging from 2 to 8 m/s. The initial investigation range included tip speed ratios from 2 to 8 and angles of attacks from 2° to 20°. Subsequently, these parameters were varied in Matlab and Xfoil software to optimization and investigate the power coefficient, blade geometry, number of blades, and blade pitch angle. It was found that a rotor solidity of 0.055–0.085 displayed better performance. © 2021, Canadian Science Publishing.

In this research, the mimicked periosteum layer based on deposited silk fibroin membrane was fabricated for guided bone regeneration in alveolar cleft surgery. The deposited silk fibroin particle membranes were fabricated by spray-drying with different concentrations of silk fibroin (v/v): 0.5% silk fibroin (0.5% SFM), 1% silk fibroin (1% SFM), 2% silk fibroin (2% SFM), and 1% silk fibroin film (1% SFF) as the control. The membranes were then characterized and the molecular organization, structure, and morphology were observed with FT-IR, DSC, and SEM. Their physical properties, mechanical properties, swelling, and degradation were tested. The membranes were cultured with osteoblast cells and their biological performance, cell viability and proliferation, total protein, ALP activity, and calcium deposition were evaluated. The results demonstrated that the membranes showed molecular transformation of random coils to beta sheets and stable structures. The membranes had a porous layer. Furthermore, they had more stress and strain, swelling, and degradation than the film. They had more unique cell viability and proliferation, total protein, ALP activity, calcium deposition than the film. The results of the study indicated that 1% SFM is promising for guided bone regeneration for alveolar cleft surgery. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","alveolar cleft; guided bone regeneration; mimicking; periosteum; Silk fibroin particle; spray drying","Biocompatible Materials; Bone Regeneration; Fibroins; In Vitro Techniques; Osteogenesis; Periosteum; Silk; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; alkaline phosphatase; calcium; silk fibroin; biomaterial; fibroin; silk; alveolar cleft surgery; Article; beta sheet; bone development; bone regeneration; cell adhesion; cell proliferation; cell viability; chemical structure; comparative study; degradation; differential scanning calorimetry; enzyme activity; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; human; in vitro study; MC3T3-E1 cell line; mechanics; osteoblast; periosteum; pore size; pore size distribution; protein synthesis; scanning electron microscopy; spray drying; surgical technique; Young modulus; bone development; bone regeneration; chemistry; infrared spectroscopy; periosteum; procedures; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold","","alkaline phosphatase, 9001-78-9; calcium, 7440-70-2, 14092-94-5; fibroin, 9007-76-5; Biocompatible Materials, ; Fibroins, ; Silk, ","","","Department of Sericulture; Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University; Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperation; Research and Development Center","The author(s) reported there is no funding associated with the work featured in this article.

One such parameter is a powder’s spreadability, described by metrics such as powder bed density and percentage coverage. This study focused on three spray-dried WC-Co powders (two 12 wt% and one 17 wt% Co) and evaluated the influence of typical powder characteristics, such as particle size and shape, apparent density, and flow rate, on their spreadability. It was found that particle size distribution influenced the powder spreadability. Larger particles hindered the even spreading of powder over the base plate, resulting in low powder bed density and percentage coverage. This also correlated with the powders’ apparent densities. The flow rate and angle of repose gave an indication of how cohesive the powders are.

In this work, the Inconel625-high-strength low-alloy (HSLA) Steel FGM was fabricated by wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). The chemical composition distribution, microstructure, phase evolution and mechanical properties of the FGM were examined. With the increasing of HSLA Steel, the chemical composition appeared graded distribution, and the primary dendrite spacing was largest in graded region with 20%HSLA Steel and then gradually decreased. And the main microstructure of the FGM transformed from columnar dendrites to equiaxed dendrites. Laves phase precipitated along dendrites boundary when the content of HSLA Steel was lower than 70% and Nb-rich carbides precipitated when the content of HSLA Steel exceeded to 70%. Microhardness and tensile strength gradually decreased with ascending content of HSLA Steel, and had a drastic improvement (159HV to 228HV and 355Mpa to 733Mpa) when proportion of HSLA Steel increased from 70% to 80%. © 2021 EDP Sciences.","Functionally graded material; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Wire arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Beams and girders; Carbides; Dendrites (metallography); Functionally graded materials; High strength alloys; Niobium compounds; Tensile strength; Textures; Chemical composition distributions; Chemical compositions; Columnar dendrites; Dissimilar metal welding; Engineering fields; Functional graded materials; Graded distributions; High strength low alloys; High-strength low-alloy steel","","","","","Science and Technology Program Project of Tianjin, (18ZXCLGX00060); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSFC, (51804217, 52074191)","Acknowledgements.

SKSJ Technological Institute, Bengaluru, India","The hypothetically convenient structure is the Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) technique that is employed for upcoming generations in wireless communication systems. Some of the benefits offered by MIMO-OFDM are enhanced spatial multiplexing, reliability and network throughput, and so on. Due to the integration of spatial antenna that is based on multistream, the problems which are related to significantly high power takes place in the system of OFDM and provides complex processing strategies. Some of the popularly known systems that are used for standardizing the Peak to average power ratio (PAPR) are partial transmit sequences (PTS), adoptive tone reservation (ATR), probabilistic mapping, and clipping which are required to be truncated and aims for minimizing the operational cost. The framework of hybrid Selective Mapping (SLM)-PTS proposed in this paper minimizes the operational cost by integrating strategies of PTS and SLM. A reduction approach that is suitable for PAPR and BER are chosen for optimization purposes depending on the statistical threshold constraint of PAPR and Bit Error Rate (BER). Thus, the system preferred with the help of the machine learning technique demonstrates the efficiency in implementing a generalized strategy to evaluate a low complexity MIMO-OFDM model. Ultimately, with the help of the PAPR and BER techniques-driven from value bound the performance of the error rate is evaluated in this framework that interactively changes from one technique. © 2021, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

The heterogeneous structure is formed by setting layers of body-centered XY rods (BCCxy) cells as the reinforcement in the body-centered cubic (GBCC) uniform lattice material. The heterogeneous lattice samples are designed and processed by additive manufacturing technology. The stress wave propagation and energy absorption properties of heterogeneous lattice materials under impact load are analyzed by finite element simulation (FES) and Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) experiments. The results show that, compared with the GBCC uniform lattice material, the spreading velocity of the stress of the (GBCC)3(BCCxy)2 heterogeneous lattice material is reduced by 18.1%, the impact time is prolonged 27.9%, the stress peak of the transmitted bar is reduced by 34.8%, and the strain energy peak is reduced by 29.7%. It indicates that the heterogeneous lattice materials are able to reduce the spreading velocity of stress and improve the energy absorption capacity. In addition, the number of layers of reinforcement is an important factor affecting the stress wave propagation and energy absorption properties.  © 2021 Cun Zhao et al.","","Crystal structure; Energy absorption;

Speeds of vehicles were measured for twenty-five multilane highways in Jordan. Data were collected during off-peak hours on sunny days with dry pavement conditions. Results indicated the difference between the design speed and speed limit (DS-SL) is the primary factor that affects speed variance. The minimum speed variance occurs when the DS-SL is 10 km/hr. Speed limits more than 10 km/hr below the design speed increase the speed variance, as road conditions (represented by design speed) tend to control vehicle’s speeds rather than speed limits in these cases. Additionally, having more highway lanes decreases speed variance, as does having roadside barriers. This paper provides beneficial information to authorities and policymakers who set speed limits on multilane highways. © 2021, Aracne Editrice.

However, its design still has several challenges related to component design, the existence of complex right half plane (RHP) zeros, and increased sensitivity to component mismatches. In this context, this paper presents an improved control and enhanced design method for the three-phase SEPIC-BDI for grid-tied applications. A generalized static linearization approach (SLA) is proposed to mitigate the low-order harmonics. It practically simplifies the control complexity and decreases the required control loops and sensor circuits. The mismatch between the SEPIC converters in each phase is highly mitigated due to the independent operation of the SLA in each phase and the output dc offset currents are reduced. The proposed enhanced design methodology modifies the SEPIC open-loop transfer function by moving the complex RHP zeros to the left half-plane (LHP). Therefore, a simple proportional-integral (PI) controller effectively maintains converter stability without adding higher-order compensators in the literature. Moreover, a straightforward integrator in the control loop eliminates the negative sequence harmonic component (NSHC) and provides a low computational burden. Simulations and experimental results based on 200V, 1.6 kW, 50 kHz prototype with silicon carbide (SiC) devices are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed work. The results show that the proposed controller and design method achieve pure output current waveforms at various operating points of the inverter and dc voltage variations. © 2013 IEEE.","Differential inverter; negative sequence harmonic component; power converters; power losses; renewable energy applications; single-ended primary-inductor converter (SEPIC)","Controllers; Electric inverters; Silicon carbide; Two term control systems; DC voltage variation; Open-loop transfer functions; Proportional integral controllers; Renewable energy applications; Right half plane zero; Silicon carbides (SiC); Single ended primary inductor converter (SEPIC); Step up/down capabilities; Design","","","","","AC3E, (ANID/Basal/FB0008); Central Laboratory; Deputyship for Research & Innovation; Ministry of Education, Saudi Arabia, (375213500); Nagoya Institute of Technology; Science and Engineering Research Council, SERC, (ANID/FONDAP15110019); Science and Engineering Research Council, SERC; Al Jouf University","This work was supported in part by the Nagoya Institute of Technology, Japan, in part by the Deputyship for Research & Innovation, Ministry of Education, Saudi Arabia, under Project 375213500, in part by the Central Laboratory, Jouf University, in part by the Chilean Government through projects SERC Chile under Grant ANID/FONDAP15110019, and in part by the AC3E under Grant ANID/Basal/FB0008.","Kouro S., Leon J.I., Vinnikov D., Franquelo L.G., Grid-connected photovoltaic systems: An overview of recent research and emerging PV converter technology, Ieee Ind.

This work presents a methodology to integrate geometric defects in a density-based formulation for topology optimization of additively built lattice materials. The method combines imperfect unit cell models capturing their geometric defects with a homogenization scheme upscaling their effective properties, into a topology optimization formulation. The method is of general application, and it is here demonstrated through the application to two cell topologies, the Tetrahedron-based and the Octet-truss unit cells, called to satisfy specific geometric constraints. Verification is performed through the solution of two well-known benchmark problems in 3D: the fixed-beam and the L-shaped beam, assumed to consist of either defect-free or imperfect lattice materials. The impact of process-induced defects, and cell orientation is demonstrated on the elastic anisotropy of the unit cell, the optimized gradients of relative density and the global compliance of the beams. The results highlight the significance of accounting for geometric defects in topology optimization of additively built lattice materials. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Geometric defects; Imperfect lattice materials; Powder bed fusion; Topology optimization","3D printers; Additives; Biomechanics; Cells; Cytology; Geometry; Homogenization method; Topology; Bench-mark problems; Effective property; Elastic anisotropy; General applications; Geometric constraint; Homogenization scheme; Optimization formulations; Optimized gradients; Defects","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","The authors acknowledge funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada through the Discovery Grant Program and the Network for Holistic Innovation in Additive Manufacturing.","Zheng X., Smith W., Jackson J., Moran B., Cui H., Chen D., Ye J., Fang N., Rodriguez N., Weisgraber T., Spadaccini C.M., Multiscale metallic metamaterials, Nat.

Initially the concept was introduced for manufacturing industry but later it has been adopted by various organizations and construction industry remain no exception. In addition to the third industrial revolution, industry 4.0 incorporates the adoption of IoT (internet of things), cyber security, augmented reality, big data, autonomous robot, additive manufacturing, simulations, system integration and cloud computing. The construction industry is considered as the third largest industrial sector and still adoption of industry 4.0 is awaited. There are numerous factors which obstruct the adoption of the fourth revolution. This study set the objective to identify the opportunity and challenges that lie within the adoption of industry 4.0 in the construction sector. Industry professionals are approached and their opinions and understandings of the IR4.0 are evaluated.

The feeding material was a powder Al2O3+ 13 wt.% TiO2(Metco 6221, OerlikonMetco) with grain size - 45 ± 15 μm. The cylinder substrates made from stainless steel (X5CrNi18-10) had a diameter equal to 25 mm and 2 mm of thickness. The variable spray parameters were plasma torch velocity in terms of substrate and spray distance. The morphology of obtained coatings was tested by scanning electron microscope (SEM), and the microstructure was investigated by light optical microscopy (LOM) and SEM. The results of mechanical properties examinations revealed the dependence of the microhardness and fracture toughness on the spray parameters. Tribological examinations were made in the ball-on-disc mode in technical dry friction conditions. Two loads were used, 5 N and 10 N. Based on the carried out tests, it could be concluded that a shorter spray distance and a reduction of the torch velocity allows one to achieve a more compact structure, which is characterized by good adhesion at the coating-substrate interface (in range from 11 to 14 MPa) and good wear resistance. © 2019 Helsinki University of Technology.

This is because the motor has performance criteria, such as high thrust force, high thrust density, and low thrust ripple. Therefore, different motor models and magnetic modeling have been studied. In these studies, especially the solutions that increase the air-gap magnetic flux density were emphasized. One of the most striking of these motor models is surely the end-iron-free structure. In this study, a single-layer (SL) (two-magnet) end-iron-free structure from a reference study was examined. A double-layer (DL) end-iron-free structure that has higher thrust force in the same motor volume, magnet volume, and parameters was proposed. An analytical approach is first developed, and then, a verification based on finite element analysis was performed. As a result of comparison with the reference study, the proposed motor provided a 10.5% increase in the thrust force and a 9.1% decrease in the thrust ripple. In addition, a design approach developed offers a practical and useful analogy between the DL and the SL. © 2021 IEEE.","Double layer (DL); end-iron-free; tubular linear voice coil motor (TLVCM)","Linear motors; Position control; Structural design; Double layer; Double layers; End irons; End-iron-free; Free structures; High thrusts; Thrust forces; Tubular linear voice coil motor; Tubulars; Voice coil motors; Iron","","","","","","","Sun J., Luo C., Xu S., Improvement of tubular linear oscillating actuators by using end ferromagnetic pole pieces, IEEE Trans.

To explore this aspect, this study focuses on the experimental measurement of the AM operator time and improvement in operator effectiveness due to learning. Learning is assessed in two ways: First, this paper measures the reduction of labour time resulting through operator learning within a series of build repetitions and estimates a progress ratio capturing the learning effect within this series. Second, this paper assesses the impact of overall operator experience by comparing the labour time required by a novice operator and an expert operator. The results suggest that AM exhibits a learning effect for both the novice and the expert operator with progress ratios of 67.73% and 80.42% respectively contrasted with 80% for other manufacturing technologies. These results will inform new theorising on AM cost-quantity behaviour. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Economies of scale; Learning; Learning curve; Learning rate;

AM is characterized by fabricating geometrically complex components in a layer-by-layer manner, and greatly reduces the geometric complexity restrictions compared with traditional manufacturing. As AM is no longer limited to the normal three degrees of freedom (DOF) (three-axis) systems, there are many new multi-DOF AM machines been developed with various aims. It is, therefore, necessary that a review of the topic with regard to multi-DOF AM is performed for future AM system development. This paper, focuses on reviewing publications related to multi-DOF AM according to the number of DOF on an AM machine. The major part of the paper aims to inspire both researchers and engineers to further develop and improve multi-DOF AM systems to achieve different goals. The final part of the paper discusses the findings together with future research directions. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Additive manufacturing; degree of freedom; multi-DOF","3D printers; Additives; Complex components; Future research directions; Geometric complexity; Layer by layer; Multiple degrees of freedom; System development; Three degrees of freedom; Traditional manufacturing; Degrees of freedom (mechanics)","","","","","","","A.Isa M., Lazoglu I., Five-Axis Additive Manufacturing of Freeform Models through Buildup of Transition Layers, Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 50, January, pp. 69-80, (2019); Bhatt P.M., Peralta M., Bruck H.A., Gupta S.K., Robot Assisted Additive Manufacturing of Thin Multifunctional Structures, Volume 1: Additive Manufacturing; Bio and Sustainable Manufacturing, (2018); Bikas H., Stavropoulos P., Chryssolouris G., Additive Manufacturing Methods and Modelling Approaches: A Critical Review, The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 83, 1, pp. 389-405, (2016); Boisselier D., Sankare S., Engel T., Improvement of the Laser Direct Metal Deposition Process in 5-Axis Configuration, 8th International Conference on Photonic Technologies LANE 2014, 56, pp. 239-249, (2014); Bourell D.L., Perspectives on Additive Manufacturing, Annual Review of Materials Research, 46, 1, pp. 1-18, (2016); Bremen S., Meiners W., Diatlov A., Selective Laser Melting, Laser Technik Journal, 9, 2, pp. 33-38, (2012); Calleja A., Tabernero I., Fernandez A., Celaya A., Lamikiz A., Lopez de Lacalle L.N., Improvement of Strategies and Parameters for Multi-Axis Laser Cladding Operations, Optics and Lasers in Engineering, 56, May, pp. 113-120, (2014); Chen L., Chung M.-F., Tian Y., Joneja A., Tang K., Variable-Depth Curved Layer Fused Deposition Modeling of Thin-Shells, Robotics and Computer-integrated Manufacturing, 57, June, pp. 422-434, (2019); Coupek D., Friedrich J., Battran D., Riedel O., Reduction of Support Structures and Building Time by Optimized Path Planning Algorithms in Multi-Axis Additive Manufacturing, Procedia CIRP, 67, January, pp. 221-226, (2018); Dai C., Charlie C.L., Wang C.W., Lefebvre S., Fang G., Liu Y.-J., Support-Free Volume Printing by Multi-Axis Motion, ACM Transactions on Graphics, 37, 4, (2018); De Backer W., Bergs A.P., Van Tooren M.J., Multi-Axis Multi-Material Fused Filament Fabrication with Continuous Fiber Reinforcement, 2018 AIAA/ASCE/AHS/ASC Structures, Structural Dynamics, and Materials Conference, (2018); Ding Y., Warton J., Kovacevic R., Development of Sensing and Control System for Robotized Laser-Based Direct Metal Addition System, Additive Manufacturing, 10, April, pp. 24-35, (2016); Ding Y., Dwivedi R., Kovacevic R., Process Planning for 8-Axis Robotized Laser-Based Direct Metal Deposition System: A Case on Building Revolved Part, Robotics and Computer-integrated Manufacturing, 44, April, pp. 67-76, (2017); Ding Y., Kovacevic R., Feasibility Study on 3-D Printing of Metallic Structural Materials with Robotized Laser-Based Metal Additive Manufacturing, JOM, 68, 7, pp. 1774-1779, (2016); Doherty S., De Backer W., Bergs A.P., Harik R., van Tooren M., Rekleitis I., Selective Directional Reinforcement of Structures for Multi-Axis Additive Manufacturing, CAMX, the Composites and Advanced Materials Expo, (2016); Edwards P., O'Conner A., Ramulu M., Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing of Titanium Components: Properties and Performance, Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering, 135, 6, (2013); Evjemo D., Linn S.M., Gravdahl J.T., Roulet-Dubonnet O., Gellein L.T., Brotan V., Additive Manufacturing by Robot Manipulator: An Overview of the State-of-the-Art and Proof-of-Concept Results, 2017 22nd IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA), pp. 1-8, (2017); Flynn J.M., A.

ICME provides robust, efficient, and optimized linkage between four pillars: (i) manufacturing process, (ii) the material’s microstructure, (iii) the material’s engineering properties, and (iv) final part performance. The multiscale approach is at the core of ICME and enables the linking of a material’s response across different length scales. ICME emphasizes and nurtures collaboration and cross-fertilization in science, software, and industry. The capabilities of ICME are illustrated through several applications based on the Digimat software platform, and covering material engineering, virtual testing, process engineering, and structural engineering, for various material systems (short fiber reinforced thermoplastic polymers, continuous fiber reinforced thermoset polymers, metals) and manufacturing processes (injection molding, curing, additive manufacturing). The examples show that ICME has achieved a maturity level enabling it to solve problems which were out of reach only a decade ago. It can be used fruitfully in industry to innovate and maximize part performance while reducing cost and lead time. An ecosystem is proposed for the industrial deployment of ICME. © 2021 by Begell House, Inc.","Composites; Computational mechanics; FEA; FFT; Homogenization; ICME; Multiscaling","Application programs; Computational mechanics; Fast Fourier transforms; Fiber reinforced plastics; Injection molding; Reinforcement; Software testing; Virtual reality; Computational materials; Engineering design; Homogenization; Integrated computational material engineering; Manufacturing process; Material engineering; Multiscaling; Paradigm shifts; Performance; Predictive engineering; Finite element method","","","","","Hexagon Technology Center in Heerbrugg; Walloon Region, (7911-VISCOS)","The authors would like to acknowledge the significant contribution of their colleagues from the Hexagon Technology Center in Heerbrugg (Switzerland) to the AI work which is presented in this paper.

The digital model created is used for a virtual representation of the final product. Then we get the physical model on a 3D printer (also called additive manufacturing process) for later use in sand moulds. To have the imprint in the sand mould, we go through the fusion of the physical model (part). The use of this technique in the industry, allows us to save a lot of time in terms of model preparation and simple to implement, especially if it is mechanical parts that do not have a definition drawing, or they are worn out, then structural analysis was applied on the model using FE based software and tools to prove the quality of the product. Von Mises equivalent strains and stresses were predicted and decreased with increasing areas and honeycomb thickness.

In this work, a series of carbon nanotubes/polylactic acid (CNTs/PLA) composites were prepared through the combination of molten co-extrusion and 3D printing processes. The orientation and dispersion of CNTs in PLA matrix were investigated to explore the impact of 3D printing process on the morphology of CNTs/PLA composites via transmission electron microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. X-ray diffractometer, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermal gravity analysis were employed to study the crystal structure and thermal properties of the composites. In addition, the electrical conductivity of the prepared specimen revealed that the orientation of CNTs in PLA might enhance the conductivity of the composite. It was found that 3D printing process was beneficial to increasing the purity of CNTs, electrical conductivity and mechanical properties of CNTs/PLA composites. © 2020","Carbon nanotubes; Microstructure; Polymer nanocomposites; Thermal stability","Additives; Carbon nanotubes; Crystal structure; Differential scanning calorimetry; Electric conductivity; Electron emission; Field emission microscopes; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Morphology; Printing presses; Scanning electron microscopy; 3D printing process; Additive manufacturing process; Electrical conductivity; Field emission scanning electron microscopy; Functional properties; Structure and thermal properties; Thermal gravity analysis; X ray diffractometers; 3D printers","","","","","Shaanxi University Science and Technology Association, (20190415); Xi'an Beilin District Programs for Science and Technology Plan; Xi’an Beilin District Programs for Science and Technology Plan, (201805037YD15CG21, GX1913); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai, (2019JQ-510); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51772243, 51802259); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2019M663785); China National Light Industry Council, CNLIC, (PQETGP2019003)","Funding text 1: This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51802259 and 51772243), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Project (No. 2019M663785), the Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi (No. 2019JQ-510), Xi'an and Xi'an Beilin District Programs for Science and Technology Plan (Nos. 201805037YD15CG21(18) and GX1913), the Promotion Program for Youth of Shaanxi University Science and Technology Association (No. 20190415), and the Fund of Key laboratory of Processing and Quality Evaluation Technology of Green Plastics of China National Light Industry Council (No. PQETGP2019003).; Funding text 2: This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51802259 and 51772243 ), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Project (No. 2019M663785 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi (No. 2019JQ-510 ), Xi’an and Xi’an Beilin District Programs for Science and Technology Plan (Nos. 201805037YD15CG21(18) and GX1913 ), the Promotion Program for Youth of Shaanxi University Science and Technology Association (No. 20190415 ), and the Fund of Key laboratory of Processing and Quality Evaluation Technology of Green Plastics of China National Light Industry Council (No. PQETGP2019003 ).","Huber C., Abert C., Bruckner F., Groenefeld M., Muthsam O., Schuschnigg S., Sirak K., Thanhoffer R., Teliban I., Vogler C., Windl R., Suess D., Appl.

This work proposes a novel resistive sensor design that utilizes the geometric freedom offered by AM, especially by material extrusion, to enable a customizable and amplified response to force and deformation. This is achieved by using a multi-material design made of an elastomer and an electrically conductive polymer that enables a physical shortening of the conductive path under compressive load through a specific definition of shape. A number of different variants of this novel sensor design are tested, measuring their mechanical and electrical behavior under compression. The results of these tests confirm a strong resistive response to mechanical loading. Furthermore, the results provide insight into the influencing factors of the design, i.e., the gap size between the conductive pathing and the stiffness of the sense element support structure are found to be primary influencing factors governing sensor behavior. © 2020 by the authors.

To describe this hardening behavior, we have developed an effective temperature model for the nonequilibrium behavior of amorphous polymers that incorporate the effects of network orientation and relaxation at large plastic deformation. The development of network orientation is introduced as a backstress that produces kinematic hardening in the stress response, while network relaxation describes the effects of temperature and strain rate on the hardening response. The model was applied to simulate the thermomechanical behavior of polycarbonate (PC) to determine the model parameters from standard dynamic frequency sweep and differential scanning calorimetry tests. The simulation results showed that the model can quantitatively capture the dependence of the hardening modulus on strain, strain rate, and temperature, as well as the unloading and reloading behavior measured in uniaxial compression tests. We applied the model to investigate the effect of plastic dissipation on the peeling of a polymer filament from a rigid substrate to guide the design of peel tests to measure the intrinsic fracture toughness of polymers fabricated by melt extrusion additive manufacturing processes. © 2020","Effective temperature; Finite element; Network relaxation; Peel; Strain hardening; Thermodynamics","3D printers; Compression testing; Differential scanning calorimetry; Fracture toughness; Melt spinning; Plastic filaments; Plastics industry; Polymers; Strain hardening; Substrates; Temperature; Unloading; Additive manufacturing process; Effective temperature; Effects of temperature and strain rate; Large plastic deformation; Nonequilibrium behavior; Thermo-mechanical behaviors; Uni-axial compression tests; Viscoplastic strains; Strain rate","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CMMI1628974); National Science Foundation, NSF","TDN and ZW acknowledge the support of the National Science Foundation CMMI1628974 .

Companies exploring opportunities to produce spare parts using AM face challenges in identifying suitable spare parts. Moreover, a single method may not be applicable for all companies. An idiosyncratic approach needs to be adopted by considering the characteristics of parts in the portfolio. This study follows a design science approach to address an evident research gap by developing a process to identify spare parts suitable for AM. The case data were analysed using multi-criteria decision-making and cluster analysis techniques. The research contributes by developing and demonstrating a methodology to identify spare parts suitable for AM from a portfolio of a large number of spare parts, where adequate discrimination was not obtained by ranking all parts together. The study develops generic guidelines for spare parts selection for AM and outline the generalizability of the proposed methodology beyond the domain of part selection for AM. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Additive manufacturing;

By optimising the structure in the expanded design space, structural performance can be improved. Topology optimisation is commonly used as the tool to optimise the structures according to specific application requirements. However, multiscale topology optimisation can be computationally expensive and with limited choices in microscale structures. Therefore, we propose a surrogate model based on three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D-CNN) to model the effective elasticity tensor and its gradients for general voxel-based nonparametric microstructures. The proposed 3D-CNN-based surrogate model greatly extends the flexibility over existing surrogate-based methods which can only be applied in relatively simple parametric microstructures. Given the microscale structure, the proposed 3D-CNN-based model can effectively predict its material properties. Furthermore, being able to estimate the gradient of the material properties with respect to microscale structure changes makes the proposed 3D-CNN-based surrogate readily adaptive to existing multiscale topology optimisation frameworks. Through extensive simulations, by comparing with both SIMP and existing surrogate-based methods, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed 3D-CNN-based surrogate model. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","multiscale analysis;

The mixtures with hydrogen concentration varying from 6% to 14% in the temperature range from 800 to 2000 K at an initial pressure of 1 and 6 atm have been investigated. Analysis of various detailed kinetic mechanisms (DKMs) presented in literature showed that the obtained calculated values of τ and SL are quite close. At the same time, the temperature dependences of the delay τ and the amount of heat release behave differently when the initial pressure increases. It is shown that an increase in the H2 initial concentration near the lower concentration limit leads to an insignificant decrease in τ. It is concluded that any of considered DKMs can be applied to predict various technological situations dealing with hydrogen fire and explosion safety near the lower concentration limit. © 2021, Torus Press Publishing House.

The addition of low-boiling solvents such as 2-ethylhexanoic acid (2-EHA) to the ethanol-based solutions supports the formation of phase-pure particles with unimodal particle-size distribution in the 10-nm range attributed to enhanced evaporation through micro-explosions. Nevertheless, in many cases, a second particle mode with sizes of a few hundred nanometers is formed. In this paper, we investigate two possible reasons for the appearance of large particles. Firstly, we analyze the effect of the oxygen dispersion gas flow applied in the two-fluid nozzle on the droplet size distributions of burning sprays using phase Doppler anemometry. We identified that an increase of the dispersion gas flow significantly decreases the number concentration of large droplets (>30 μm), which causes a significant increase of the BET surface area of as-synthesized LaMnO3and LaCoO3with increasing dispersion gas flow from 60 m2/g (5 slm dispersion gas) to 100 m2/g (8 slm). Secondly, the esterification in the mixture of solvents towards ethyl-2-ethylhexanoate, which is associated with the release of water as a byproduct, was analyzed by GC/MS. The ester concentration in the iron-containing solution was found to be up to nine times higher than in cobalt or manganese precursor solutions. Simultaneously, the produced LaFeO3materials show lower BET surface areas and the increasing dispersion gas flow has a minor effect on this material than on the cobalt and manganese perovskite cases. We attribute this to the fact that water formed during esterification forces the hydrolysis of iron nitrate and the formation of large particles within the droplets. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, the vibrations of FGM beams are studied at eight different boundary conditions such as F=F, SS=SS, C=C, C=SS, C=F, F=SS, C=SL, and F-SL. The exact equations of natural frequencies of FGM beams are derived for that different boundary conditions. A good agreement between present results and the results of previous literature. At all the different boundary conditions, the same behavior observed for natural frequencies at all modes when the physical properties of the beam are changing such as the thickness, the length, the density of material or ceramic, the elasticity of material or ceramic, and the ratio of volume fraction. When the ratio of volume fraction increases, the natural frequencies decrease. As the dimensionless ratio (L/h) increases, the natural frequencies will be decreased. When the dimensionless ratio (Em/Ec) increases, the natural frequencies increase too, but that frequencies decrease when the dimensionless ratio (ρm/ρc) increases. © 2021 Zibeline International Publishing Sdn.

The equivalent frame model, developed by Nascimento Neto, was used to simulate the support structure and the first masonry floor, and a specific three-dimensional frame model to simulate the other floors. Four analysis models were applied to assess stress distribution at the base of the walls, and the stresses and displacements of the support structure.

Accurate experimental characterization of adhesion and the spatial surface adhesion distribution of a single microparticle has been a significant challenge, due mainly to difficulties associated with the micro-scale handling/manipulation in a controllable manner and uncertainty in the nature of micro/nano-scale contacts. In current work, an approach for determining the spatial energy/adhesion distribution on the surfaces of single microparticles used in AM is introduced and demonstrated using Molybdenum (Mo) metal particles as model particles. Both ultrasonic base and Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW)-based excitation techniques coupled with laser Doppler vibrometry are utilized to excite and acquire the vibrational rocking motion and to drive the rolling motion of single Mo particles on a Silicon (Si) substrate in a controllable manner and, thereby determining the spatial adhesion distribution on the particle surfaces. Spatial surface energy distribution data of microparticles could be utilized in Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations as a statistical input for simulating local powder bed dynamics with increased accuracy, which would potentially lead to more predictable AM processes. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","metal microparticles in additive manufacturing; non-contact characterization; single powder particles adhesion characterization; Spatial adhesion mapping of single particles","Additives; Adhesion; Distribution; Motion; Particles; Powder; Surface Energy; Surfaces; 3D printers; Acoustic surface wave devices; Acoustic waves; Additives; Adhesion; Digital storage; Finite difference method; Laser excitation; Nondestructive examination; Powder metals; Ultrasonic testing; Energy distributions; Excitation technique; Experimental characterization; Micro-particles; Non-contact; Powder particles; Single particle; Surface acoustic waves; Spatial distribution","","","","","Scott Volk and Ajay Krishnan of Incodema3D Inc.; Jean-Francois Carrier of Tekna Inc.; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1066877)","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [1066877].

Therefore, it is essential to develop an advanced approach for fatigue issues. Although some theoretical methods are used for fatigue analysis of AM metal parts, their implementations are time-consuming. Furthermore, these methods cannot directly consider the effects of AM parameters. In this study, a platform is developed for a data-driven analysis of continuum damage mechanics (CDM)-based fatigue life prediction of AM stainless steel (SS) 316L, in which the effects of AM process parameters (including laser power P, scan speed v, hatch space h, powder layer thickness t) are considered. Here, three typical ML models: an artificial neural network (ANN), a random forest (RF), and a support vector machine (SVM), are trained effectively by a database produced by the CDM technique, and then further comparisons are made between the predicted results and published experimental data to verify the proposed platform. Finally, detailed parametric studies using the ML models are conducted to investigate some of the significant characteristics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Continuum damage mechanics;

Without the support of the conventional formworks, the shaping of the additive manufactured concrete structure mostly depends on the rheological properties of the fresh materials. Even though the fresh state cementitious materials' rheological properties can be well characterized by using a rheometer, no previous study has investigated the effective and reliable real-time monitoring methods for in-situ rheological properties monitoring. This paper attempts to investigate the feasibility of using the piezoelectric-based electromechanical impedance (EMI) method to fill this gap. The EMI test and the rheological test were performed simultaneously. The calculated sensing index from EMI signals displays an excellent linear correlation with the results from the rheometer.

However, the lack of cost-effective, straightforward, and facile routes to formulate multifunctional graphene aqueous inks with excellent conductivity and high apparent viscosity have greatly limited their applications, particularly in high concentration processing and additive-manufacturing. Here, the high-concentration graphene aqueous inks based on structure controllable, sand-milling exfoliation of raw graphite is reported. Such a route yields 62.8% graphene dispersed in water with a high concentration up to 25.1 mg mL−1, which can be formulated into aqueous inks with excellent printability. As such, the screen printing of the viscous graphene inks into film-heating devices and micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) is further demonstrated. Due to its excellent conductivity (up to ≈870 S cm−1 after annealing), the graphene film showcases a fast ramping temperature (171.9 °C) at 8 V in 75 s in the heating device, and a high areal capacitance (1.36 mF cm−2) in the MSCs, respectively. It is thus believed that the mechanical-exfoliated graphene inks hold great promise in scalable production of high-performance printable wearable electronics. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH","conductive inks; graphene; heating films; micro-supercapacitors; sand-milling exfoliation","3D printers; Cost effectiveness; Electronics industry; Exfoliation (materials science); Flexible electronics; Flowcharting; Graphene devices; Heating equipment; Milling (machining); Screen printing; Wearable technology; Apparent viscosity; Cost effective; Exfoliated graphene; Graphene films; Heating devices; Micro supercapacitors; Multi-functional graphene; Scalable production; Graphene","","","","","Fangda Carbon New Material Co., Ltd; Petro China Innovation Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (50703017); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; PetroChina Innovation Foundation, (502‐071100003); PetroChina Innovation Foundation; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (lzujbky‐2019‐sp03); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","Funding text 1: This work was financially supported by the Petro China Innovation Foundation (502‐071100003) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (50703017).

To improve the robustness, a multi-step algorithm is proposed. The variable thickness sheet (VTS) method and the projection-based regularization mechanism are used to realize the free material optimization with a limited number of lattice microstructures. Then, a series of successive filtering and projection operations are adopted to identify the lattice-lattice interface layers based on the material density distribution. Elements with close densities are grouped into clusters and for elements inside each cluster, they are assumed to have the same periodical lattice microstructure. In the second step, based on the achieved discrete material distribution, the macrostructure with a solid shell layer and the multiple representative lattice microstructures are concurrently optimized with the density-based multi-scale topology optimization method. Several benchmark numerical examples are studied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, additive manufacturing experiments are performed to validate the stiffness enhancement by including the lattice-lattice interface layers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Density filtering; Density projection; Lattice infill; Multi-scale topology optimization; Shell and interface layers","Additives; Microstructure; Numerical methods; Topology; Discrete material; Free material optimizations; Lattice structures; Manufacturability; Multiple representatives; Regularization mechanism; Stiffness enhancement; Variable thickness; 3D printers","","","","","Shandong Research Institute of Industrial Technology; Shandong University, SDU; University of Alberta, UofA; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (RGPIN-2020–03956, RGPIN-2020, 03956); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (BK20190198); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the support from Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province ( BK20190198 ), the support from Qilu Young Scholar Award, Shandong University, and the support from Shandong Research Institute of Industrial Technology.

The fabricated electrodes were used to perform electric discharge machining on D2 steel workpiece. The comparative study was performed on material removal and electrode wear rates between the solid copper electrode, rapid manufactured electrode without cryogenic cooling and with cryogenic cooling. Also, the surface characteristics of the worn electrode and the machined workpiece were studied with and without cryogenic cooling. The significant effect of the cryogenic cooling on the electrode wear rate and the surface roughness was observed. Better surface finish, small cracks and less debris were notified on the workpiece surface machined with rapid manufactured electrode with cryogenic cooling due to rapid dissipation of the heat from the surface of the electrode after machining. Similarly, few cracks and low carbon deposition was observed on the rapid manufactured electrode with cryogenic cooling surface after machining as compared to rapid manufactured electrode without cryogenic cooling. The sharp corner edges of the complex shape tool in rapid manufactured electrode with cryogenic cooling were retained after machining due to low melting and vaporization of the electrode material. The dimensional deviation of the machined surface with respect to computer-aided design model was compared. The rapid manufactured electrode with cryogenic cooling was found to machine the more accurate complex shape features in terms of dimensions on the workpiece as compared to rapid manufactured electrode without cryogenic cooling. © IMechE 2020.","cooling channels;

Herein, the GMAWAM process was used to build new low-carbon steel features on an existing low-carbon steel component to obtain a new part with new functionalities. To confirm the internal quality of the new part obtained by such a strategy that is adequate for real applications, its material properties were investigated. The obtained results reveal that the new features (i.e., thin walls) built by GMAWAM possess different microstructure types. The upper region of thin-walled features exhibits lamellar structures, whereas the middle region is characterized by granular structures, and mixed equiaxed and lamellar grains appear in the bottom region. Particularly, the new features have an excellent bonding strength with the existing part. The material properties of GMAWAM-repurposed parts also meet industrial requirements, confirming that the GMAWAM-repurposed parts are adequate with real applications. © 2020, International Institute of Welding.","Low-carbon steel; Material properties; Microstructures; Repurposing; Wire arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Gas metal arc welding; Gas welding; Lamellar structures; Mechanical properties; Textures; Thin walled structures; Bonding strength; Bottom regions; Granular structuress; Industrial requirements; Internal quality; Lamellar grains; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Real applications; Low carbon steel","","","","","National Foundation for Science and Technology Development, NAFOSTED, (107.99-2019.18)","This research is funded by the Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 107.99-2019.18.

The sensor is based on a complementary split-ring resonator (CSRR) driven by a conductor-backed coplanar waveguide (CBCPW). The sensor has a planar topology, which makes it simple and cost-effective to produce and accurate in measuring both physical quantities. The sensor has two components, a rotor and a stator: the first of these (the CSRR) can rotate around its axis and translate along the plane normal to the ground of the CBCPW. A detailed theoretical and numerical analysis, along with a circuit model, of the unique sensor design is presented. The proposed sensor exhibits linear response for measuring angular rotation and proximity in the range of 30°-60° and 0-200 μm, respectively. Another distinctive feature of the rotation and proximity sensor is the wide frequency band of applicability, which is an integral part of its novel design and is implemented through various dielectric material loadings on the CSRR. In the prototype of the proposed device, the stator (CBCPW) is fabricated on a 0.508-mm-thick RF-35 substrate, whereas the CSRR-based rotor is fabricated on TLY-5 and RF-35 substrates. The angular rotation, proximity, operating band selection, and sensitivity are measured using a vector network analyzer and are found to be good matches to the simulated and theoretical results.  © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Additive manufacturing; conductor-backed coplanar waveguide (CBCPW); dielectric constant; material characterization; microwave planar sensor; proxi-mity sensor; rapid prototyping industry; rotation sensor","Coplanar waveguides; Cost effectiveness; Dielectric materials; Electric network analyzers; Optical resonators; Rapid prototyping; Rotation; Stators; Substrates; Angular rotations; Circuit modeling; Complementary split-ring resonator; Conductor backed coplanar waveguides; Physical quantities; Planar topology; Vector network analyzers; Wide frequency bands; Microwave sensors","","","","","Electromagnetic Design of flexIbleSen-sOrs, (POIR.04.04.00-00-1DC3/16-00); European Commission, EC; Fundacja na rzecz Nauki Polskiej, FNP; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","Manuscript received February 12, 2019; revised November 3, 2019; accepted December 18, 2019.

Analysis of the high-temperature plastic behaviour of lean medium-manganese steel 0.2C3Mn1.5Si was carried out in the temperature range of 900-1200◦C and the deformation rate in the range of 0.01-10 s−1 to the maximum value of the true strain 0.8. Microstructural changes were observed using light optical microscopy (LOM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effect of hot deformation temperature on true stress, peak stress, and the true strain was evaluated using the flow curves. Based on these results, transformations in steel were discussed from the dynamic recovery and recrystallisation point of view. Furthermore, a present model, taking into account the Zener-Hollomon parameter, was applied to predict the true stress and strain over a wide range of temperatures and strain rates. Using constitutive equations, material parameters and activation energy for the investigated steel could be derived. Results demonstrate the use of the model for lean medium-Mn quenching and partitioning steel (Q&P) compositions in hot deformation applications with acceptable accuracy. © 2021 Institute of Materials and Machine Mechanics, Slovak Academy of Sciences.

The speed of the technological development of AM is faster than of the educational one; curricula and teaching methods have to evolve all the time in order to keep up with the development. The implementation of AM into the mechanical engineering curriculum in Lapland university of applied sciences (Lapland UAS) in Finland is used as an example in this study. The aim and purpose of this study is to create a model of technical pedagogy which gives universities the possibility to integrate AM into their curriculum more efficiently. This happens by combining traditional pedagogy into technical subjects in curriculum development work. This study also presents the learning concept of AM which shows the learning to be inversely proportional to the requirements of AM. Identification of the learning process of AM help the educators to plan AM education more efficiently. © 2020 Kassel University Press GmbH.

Attempting to achieve this aim, thin walls were fabricated via regulating the latter wire feed speed (LWFS). The results show that the microstructure in the as-built 308 L walls consists of δ and γ phases, and the residual ferrite content presents an increasing trend with the increase in LWFS. As the LWFS reaches 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 m/min, the microstructures exhibit the coarse dendrite, fine dendrite, and columnar dendrite morphologies, respectively. The microhardness and tensile strength of the tensile specimens increase with the LWFS. As the LWFS is 0.8 m/min, the tensile strength in the horizontal direction can reach 570.71 MPa, increasing by 7.55% in comparison to the LWFS of 0.2 m/min and enhancing by 50.71 MPa than the wrought 308 L stainless steel. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.","Additive; double; feeding; GTA; latter; manufacturing; mechanical; microstructure; stainless; steel; strength; wire","3D printers; Dendrites (metallography); Gas metal arc welding; Tensile strength; Walls (structural partitions); Wire; Columnar dendrites; Feed speed; Ferrite content; Gas tungsten arc; Molten pool; Tensile performance; Tensile specimens; Thin walls; Austenitic stainless steel","","","","","Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program, (2020JDRC0059, 2020YFG0197); Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51975491, 61573293); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China, no. 51975491 and no. 61573293, Sichuan Science and Technology Program, no. 2020JDRC0059 and no. 2020YFG0197.","Astafurova E., Panchenko M., Moskvina V., Maier G., Astafurov S., Melnikov E., Fortuna A., Reunova K., Rubtsov V., Kolubeav E., Microstructure and Grain Growth Inhomogeneity in Austenitic Steel Produced by Wire-feed Electron Beam Melting: The Effect of Post-building Solid-solution Treatment, J.

Critical objectives for the AM processes are how to ensure product quality and process consistency. The detection and correction of part and process anomalies show great promises and challenges. This paper presents an online laser-based process monitoring and control system to improve the geometric accuracy and in-plane surface quality for the AM process. The point cloud dataset obtained from the 3D laser scanner provides the current part height in the Z direction and in-plane surface depth information for each layer. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is designed with the pre-trained VGG16 model and validated using the monitoring data to effectively classify the in-plane anomalies. Two developed PID-based online closed-loop control systems are implemented which can significantly reduce the height deviation errors between the fabricated part measurements and design values, and correct the in-plane surface anomalies. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Additive Manufacturing (AM);

Key microstructural features of the as-built WAAM alloy include large columnar grains, grain boundary colonies, and Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) banding, which generally leads to low ductility and anisotropy. In this study, Ti6AlxV (x = 0, 2, 4) alloys were prepared by WAAM, the effects of vanadium content on the microstructure, tensile properties and impact toughness were investigated. Irregularshaped, plate-like features without columnar grains and HAZ banding were obtained in Ti6Al alloy. Columnar grains were observed in Ti6Al2V alloy, and the grain size was further enlarged to more than ten millimeters by 4 mass% vanadium addition. With the increasing of vanadium content, a monotonic increase in yield strength and ultimate tensile strength can be observed, while the fracture strain and impact toughness changed in the opposite trend. Ti6Al and Ti6Al2Valloy exhibited better matching of strength, ductility and impact toughness compared with Ti6Al4V alloy.  © 2021 The Japan Institute of Metals and Materials.","Impact toughness; Mechanical property; Microstructure; Strength; Ti6Al4V; Titanium alloy; Wire arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Ductility; Fracture toughness; Gas metal arc welding; Gas welding; Grain boundaries; Heat affected zone; Microstructure; Tensile strength; Ternary alloys; Vanadium; Vanadium alloys; Advanced manufacturing technologies; Gas tungsten arc welding; Microstructural features; Microstructure and mechanical properties; Ti-6Al-4V alloy; Ultimate tensile strength; Vanadium addition; Vanadium content; Titanium alloys","","","","","","","Boyer R.R., Mater.

Three typical scratching directions, edge forward (EF), face forward (FF), and side-face forward (SFF), were considered in the TBN processes. By analyzing the variation of the projected area of the tip, groove morphology, and silicon atomic flow behavior, the simulation results showed that the tip inclination and scratching direction had significant influences on groove generation, which is caused by the various atomic flow directions for scratching with different inclination angles and scratching directions. The change of the contact area induced by the tip inclination and scratching direction was the main reason for the variation of the scratching forces, and the normal forces were more sensitive than the tangential forces. Moreover, the plastic behavior, including the hydrostatic stress distribution, phase transformation, and the amorphous silicon distribution, were also dependent on the combination effect of the tip inclination and scratching direction. The results will provide important guidance for the process of TBN on silicon materials. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Scratching orientation; Single-crystal silicon; Tip inclination; Tip-based nanomanufacturing","Molecular dynamics; Monocrystalline silicon; Silicon wafers; Single crystals; Combination effects; Inclination angles; Molecular dynamics simulations; Plastic behavior; Silicon materials; Single crystal silicon; Tangential force; Tip-based nanomanufacturing; Amorphous silicon","","","","","Heilongjiang Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (LBH-TZ1703, LBH-Z16079); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51705104, 51911530206); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2017 M610206, 2018 T110289); Harbin Institute of Technology, HIT, (SKLRS202001C); State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51705104, 51911530206), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2017M610206 and 2018T110289), Heilongjiang Postdoctoral Fund (LBH-Z16079 and LBH-TZ1703), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (HIT.

The placement process is quite complex, requiring suffcient fow properties as the material leaves the nozzle, and suffcient stiffening properties before the subsequent layer is placed. Precise control of material proportions and in-line monitoring of the time-dependent rheology are required to ensure the successful adoption of AM in the concrete construction community. To facilitate the study of the rheological properties of cementitious materials, as they pertain to AM, a commercial bench-top fused flament fabrication three-dimensional (3-D) printer was modifed to dispense cement paste mixtures. Modifcations included the design and assembly of a pumping system and software modifcations to the 3-D printer's frmware that were necessary to accommodate the new hardware.

Successful joints free of micro-porosity, micro-cracking, and oxides were obtained. Microstructure variations across the weld line developed during LFW were examined using different techniques, including laser confocal microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The microstructure was also evaluated, particularly in terms of Grain size and misorientation changes were determined and correlated with microhardness evolution in different regions of the weld joint. The characteristics of the microstructure on both sides of the weld joint was analyzed and related to the deformation and temperature paths imposed during the LFW process. Dynamic recrystallization (DRX) occurred on both sides of the dissimilar weld line and it was found that Discontinuous DRX (DDRX) and Continuous DRX (CDRX) took place in the WZ and in the TMAZ, respectively. In order to study the influence of the starting microstructure in the LFW experiments, LFW of a homogenized SLM IN718 sample was analyzed and compared with the non-homogenized sample. A clear change in the size and grain misorientation levels of the heat and thermomechanical affected zones were observed between the two conditions. The differences were related to a greater degree of strain induced in homogenized sample and the increasing effect of the solid solution strengthening mechanism caused by a partial dissolution of the second-phase strengthening particles in the matrix. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Additive manufacturing; Dissimilar linear friction welding; Dynamic recrystallization; Microhardness; Misorientation; Ni-based superalloys","Dynamic recrystallization; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Friction; Friction welding; Grain size and shape; Microstructure; Nickel alloys; Scanning electron microscopy; Superalloys; Dynamic recrystallization (DRX); Electron back scatter diffraction; Energy dispersive spectroscopies (EDS); Laser confocal microscopy; Microstructure variations; Nickel- based superalloys; Second phase strengthening; Solid solution strengthening; Welds","","","","","; TWI Ltd.","The authors are grateful for the support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) 2018-03889 through a Discovery Grant.

The LHS model is a complex counterpart of the Lohe sphere(LS) aggregation model on the unit sphere in Euclidean space, and it describes the aggregation of particles on the unit Hermitian sphere in ℂd with d ≥ 2. Recently it has been introduced by two authors of this work as a special case of the Lohe tensor model. When the coupling gain pair satisfies a specific linear relation, namely the Stuart-Landau(SL) coupling gain pair, it can be embedded into the LS model on ℝ2d . In this work, we show that if the coupling gain pair is close to the SL coupling pair case, the dynamics of the LHS model exhibits an emergent aggregate phenomenon via the interplay between time-delayed interactions and nonlinear coupling between states. For this, we present several frameworks for complete aggregation and practical aggregation in terms of initial data and system parameters using the Lyapunov functional approach. © American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.","Emergence; Hermitian sphere; Hermitian sphere; Tensor; Tensor; Time-delay; Time-delay. and phrases.

It presents the methodology used for calculating the temporal behavior of the aerodynamic torque generated by the blades during their acceleration phase. The tests were performed in an open section wind tunnel of 1.0 × 0.8 m. The model was produced by additive manufacturing and had two possible assemblies, with three and five blades. An in-line dynamic torque meter acquired the torque and angular speed data, and a National Instruments USB-6009 device processed the signal. The resistive torques were calculated by spin-down tests. The tests were executed at a wind speed of 10 m·s–1 . The measurements displayed the five blades assembly having improved performance compared to the three blades: a higher static torque, which resulted in shorter stating time, and a power coefficient 39% higher. © 2021, Journal of Aerospace Technology and Management.

In addition, for the first time, conductive polylactic acid (PLA) is rigorously characterized across both X- and Ku-bands (8 to 18 GHz); while acrylonitrile butadiene-styrene (ABS) has similarly been characterized across Ku-band (12 to 18 GHz). Using the results from the conductive PLA characterization process, an electromagnetic model was created for predicting the performance of the RVA. It is shown that, even with its complex internal geometrical features, a mix of both dielectric and conductive PLA building materials, an assembly of multiple parts and a mechanically rotating central section, our experimental proof-of-concept prototype RVA exhibits excellent measured performance across Ku-band. This tunable microwave control device represents a higher-level of functionality for additive manufacturing, when compared to a fixed (i.e., non-movable) 3-D printed structure, opening the way for other groups to routinely 3-D print custom microwave components and subsystems in the not too distant future. © 2013 IEEE.","3-D printing; acrylonitrile butadiene-styrene (ABS); additive manufacturing; circular waveguide; conductive PLA; dielectric characterization; fused deposition modelling (FDM); microwave; polylactic acid (PLA); polymer-jetting (PolyJet); rectangular waveguide; Rotary vane attenuator (RVA)","3D printers; Dielectric materials; Polymer blends; Styrene; Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene; Electromagnetic modeling; Geometrical features; Microwave characterization; Microwave components; Poly lactic acid; Printed structures; Tunable microwave; Microwaves","","","","","U.K. Space Agency, (RP10G0435A202); Unión Europea; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF; Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI; University of the East, UE, (PRX19/00074, TEC2016-76070-C3-3-R)","This work was supported in part by the Spanish Government (Agencia Estatal de Investigación, Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional, Unión Europea) (AEI/FEDER, UE) under Grant TEC2016-76070-C3-3-R (ADDMATE) and Project Salvador de Madariaga under Grant PRX19/00074, and in part by the U.K. Space Agency’s Centre for Earth Observation Instrumentation (CEOI) under Grant RP10G0435A202.","Larson W., The Rotary-Vane Attenuator As An Interlaboratory Stan-dard, 144, (1975); James A.V., A high-accuracy microwave-attenuation standard for use in primary calibration laboratories, IRE Trans.

The current study examines the feasibility and performance of additively manufactured complex ceramic structures with geometric functionalization to actualize novel porous media burner design concepts for enhanced performance. Smoothly graded porous structures are synthesized using triply periodic minimal surfaces and manufactured via lithography-based ceramic manufacturing. Experiments are performed on these structures to characterize flame stability, axial temperature profiles, and pressure drop for three different pore-scale topologies. These measurements are complimented by computational predictions from one-dimensional volume-averaged models. X-ray computed tomography was used to verify relevant geometric properties of the structures, as well as to examine the material after combustion. This work demonstrates the first smoothly graded burner, leveraging recent advancements in additive manufacturing to design, fabricate, and test the performance of burner concepts unattainable by traditional ceramic foam manufacturing techniques. © 2020 The Combustion Institute.

Heat treatment was used after the WAAM process. The microstructure and mechanical property anisotropy before and after the heat treatment were studied. There were three areas with different grain morphology along building direction in the as-deposited wall structure. Microstructure difference was clear between interlayer regions and intra-layer regions both in as-deposited and heat-treated state. Netlike second phases became discontinuous after heat treatment, but pores and Fe-rich phases basically unchanged. Mechanical property presented isotropy before heat treatment because α-Al with lower Cu content had low resistance on crack initiation or growth and crack mainly grew via netlike second phases which had no directionality. Mechanical property presented anisotropy after heat treatment because α-Al was strengthened and brittle Fe-rich phases which concentrated in interlayer regions played a leading role in crack initiation. Moreover, the tensile loading force along the building direction was perpendicular to interlayer regions. Thus, mechanical properties in building direction were lower than that in deposition direction. © 2020, ASM International.","Al alloy; heat treatment; mechanical property anisotropy; microstructure; wire and arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Anisotropy; Crack initiation; Cracks; Heat resistance; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Morphology; Walls (structural partitions); Welding; Wire; Grain morphologies; Interlayer regions; Low resistance; Micro-structure evolutions; Microstructure and mechanical properties; Tensile loading; Wall structure; Welding wires; After-heat treatment","","","","","China Academy of Space Technology, CAST; Key Technologies Research and Development Program, (2018YFB1106000, 2018YFB1106305, 2019QNRC001); Key Technologies Research and Development Program","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from the National Key Technologies R&D Program (Grant No. 2018YFB1106000), the National Key Technologies R&D Program (Grant No. 2018YFB1106305) and Project (2019QNRC001) supported by the Youth Talent Project of CAST.

The proposed method uses material and geometric non-linearity. Various stress-strain diagrams can be used: linear, linear-plastic, parabolic-plastic, two various parabolic and rigid-plastic. In all cases, the tensile strength is neglected. The method can be used for analysing the column in accordance with Eurocodes in two ways: SLS (serviceability limit state) and ULS (ultimate limit state). The internal forces are calculated on a general beam model, with imperfections in both directions, which result in two bending moments in two perpendicular planes – biaxial bending. This case is not covered by the current code – Eurocode, even though all columns are more or less loaded in both directions. In this numerical study, using Matlab software, an algorithm was developed for modelling a real 3D case. The results of this study are also compared to the results of laboratory tests of masonry columns. © Czech Technical University in Prague, 2021.","Column; Masonry; Non-linearity; Stress-strain diagram","","","","","","","","Pume D., Lorenz K., En 1996–1–1-design of masonry structures, (2007); 5628-1:2005 Code of practice for the use of masonry, Part 1: Structural use of unreinforced masonry, (2005); Das B., Principles of foundation engineering, (2018); Jager W., Mauerwerk-Kalender 2012, Schwerpunkt: Eurocode 6, (2013); Forster V., Load-bearing capacity of slender unreinforced masonry compression members under biaxial bending, Mauerwerk, 21, 5, pp. 320-331, (2017); Cais J., The eccentrical loading of columns in accordance with new standards, Inženýrské stavby, 5, (1957); Building code requirements for masonry structures, (2013); Vokal M., Drahorad M., Non–linear analysis of slender masonry beam, Transactions of the VŠB, 17, 1, (2017); Milani G., Lourenco P., Tralli A., Homogenization approach for the limit analysis of out-of-plane loaded masonry walls, Journal of Structural Engineering-asce, 132, (2006); Gazzola E., Drysdale R., Essawy A., Bending of concrete masonry walls at different angles to the bed joints, Proceedings 3th North American Masonry Conference, 27, (1985); Southcombe C., May I., Chong V., The behaviour of brickwork panels with openings under lateral load, Proceedings of the British Masonry Society, 7, pp. 105-110, (1995); Timoshenko S., Gere J., Theory of Elastic Stability, (1961); Bazant Z.

Design/methodology/approach: The skull biomodel was produced in polyamide while implants were made of a Ti-6Al-4V alloy by AM. Findings: The method enabled perfectly fitting implants and anatomical conformance with the craniomaxillofacial defect, providing complete healing for the patient. Surgical planning using a customized 3D polyamide biomodel was effective. This proved to be a powerful tool for medical planning and manufacturing of customized implants, as complete healing and good craniofacial aesthetic results were observed. Originality/value: Satisfactory surgical procedures, regarding surgery time reduction and good craniofacial aesthetic results, were achieved. Furthermore, the 3D titanium customized implants represented a favorable alternate for the repair of craniomaxillofacial defects. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","3D; CAD/CAM; Modeling; Rapid prototyping; Surgery","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Bone; Defects; Titanium alloys; Transplantation (surgical); Bone reconstruction; Craniomaxillofacial; Design/methodology/approach; Pre-operative planning; Surgical planning; Surgical procedures; Threedimensional (3-d); Ti-6Al-4V alloy; Implants (surgical)","","","","","Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP","This work was supported by grant #2015/20630–4, São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP).

However, this can lead to long-standing problems of low-compliance, severe skin trauma, and higher fit test failure rates among certain demographic groups, particularly females and non-white ethnic groups. Additive manufacturing could be a viable solution to produce custom-fitted RPE, but the manual design process is time-consuming, cost-prohibitive and unscalable for mass customization. This paper proposes an automated design pipeline which generates the computer-aided design models of custom-fit RPE from unprocessed three-dimensional (3D) facial scans. The pipeline successfully processed 197 of 205 facial scans with <2 min/scan. The average and maximum geometric error of the mask were 0.62 mm and 2.03 mm, respectively. No statistically significant differences in mask fit were found between male and female, Asian and White, White and Others, Healthy and Overweight, Overweight and Obese, Middle age, and Senior groups. © 2021.

A mass personalization paradigm provides unique products to cater to their needs, using the flexibility of additive manufacturing. The lack of quantitative knowledge on mouthpiece design hinders the personalization attempts. This study aims to lay out how design parameters affect mouthpiece characteristics. Twenty-seven 3D-printed mouthpieces with varying design parameters are used in conjunction with an artificial blowing machine, to determine the acoustical relevance of the various mouthpiece designs on four selected mouthpiece features. The influence of the design parameters is evaluated statistically and via a case study with five saxophonists. The analysis shows that seven out of nine parameters tested affect the mouthpiece characteristics by relatively different amounts. A user study demonstrates that saxophonists confirm the results in 7 of 10 cases, and they prefer personalized mouthpieces in 4 of 5 cases. The results present a key contribution to the understanding of mouthpiece design. The findings provide valuable insights for new mouthpiece design and mouthpiece personalization.  © M.

The working or mobile platform is the base for objects that will be manipulated, for example, in automated assembling. The micropositioner can be integrated into a microgripper to generate a complete manipulation system. For micropositioner fabrication, at first, Polylactic Acid (PLA) was chosen as the structural material, but after simulation and some experimental tests performed with a micropositioner made of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), it showed larger displacement (approx. 20%) due to its lower stiffness. A third test was performed with a positioner made with Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PETG), obtaining an intermediate performance. The originality of this work resides in the geometrical arrangement based on thermoplastic polymer compliance mechanisms, as well as in the use of additive manufacturing to fabricate it. An experimental setup was developed to carry out experimental tests. ANSYS™ was used for simulation. © 2021 by the authors.

In total, 36 HSC specimens were prepared and tested for creep. Three specimens were used for the plain HSC creep test, 6 specimens were used for the reinforced HSC creep test, and 27 specimens were used for companion shrinkage tests. The applicability of existing creep models in predicting the creep of HSC containing SF and SL were evaluated. In addition, the effect of compressive strength and reinforcement ratio on reinforced HSC was investigated. Moreover, a new procedure to calculate the creep of reinforced HSC columns, based on the modified creep model and an existing creep recovery model, was developed. Finally, a parametric analysis was conducted to investigate the effects of compressive strength, reinforcement ratio, stress–strength ratio, loading age, and volume–surface ratio on reinforced HSC. © 2020 fib.

However, the vast composition space presents a significant practical challenge for optimization, particularly when relying on sequential use of conventional metallurgical fabrication and characterization methods. An efficient method for rapidly evaluating the properties of complex concentrated alloys is presented. Powder based directed energy deposition additive manufacturing was used to synthesize a broad range of compositions in a single metallurgical sample via in situ alloying. An investigation of the phase-property space was done by compositionally grading a transition metal-based HEA (CoCrFeMnNi) with several refractory metals (i.e., Ta, Nb, and Ti-6Al-4V). A high throughput microstructural-mechanical analysis method was also utilized to rapidly assess microstructure and hardness as a function of alloy composition. Compositions promoting solid solutions, multiple phases, and intermetallics were found to have a wide range of hardness and fabrication quality. These results are discussed in the context of alloy-specific microstructural characteristics and configurational entropy, along with relevant processing challenges. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Complex concentrated alloys; Material discovery; Microstructural characterization; Refractory metals","3D printers; Additives; Chromium alloys; Chromium metallurgy; Cobalt alloys; Cobalt metallurgy; Entropy; Grading; Hardness; Iron alloys; Iron metallurgy; Manganese alloys; Manganese metallurgy; Nickel metallurgy; Refractory metals; Throughput; Alloy compositions; Composition space; Configurational entropy; Fabrication and characterizations; High throughput screening tools; Mechanical analysis; Micro-structural characteristics; Thermal and mechanical properties; High-entropy alloys","","","","","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA, (DE-NA0003525); Laboratory Directed Research and Development, LDRD","The authors wish to thank C.

The degree to which it can be relied upon to retard leakage through cracks in water retaining structures has, to date, not been quantified in probabilistic terms. Previous research identified the crack width as a critical parameter in the autogenous self-sealing of flow through cracks in tension-cracked, reinforced concrete. In this research, two experimental databases are collected and compiled, and are used to probabilistically model the prediction of initial flow through, and the subsequent leakage through tension cracks considering the effects of self-sealing. The total leakage is characterized as a function of crack width range, identifying the notable effect of increasing crack width on increased leakage duration and magnitude. This research is a first step toward quantifying the achieved SLS reliability for water retaining structures. © 2020 fib.

Surface defects need to be identified early in the AM process to avoid further deterioration of the part quality. In this paper, a rapid surface defect identification method for directed energy deposition (DED) is proposed. The main contribution of this work is the development of an in-situ point cloud processing with machine learning methods that enable automatic surface monitoring without sensor intermittence. An in-house software platform with a multi-nodal architecture is developed. In-situ point cloud processing steps, including filtering, segmentation, surface-to-point distance calculation, point clustering, and machine learning feature extraction, are performed by multiple subprocesses running simultaneously. The combined unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques are applied to detect and classify surface defects. The proposed method is experimentally validated, and a surface defect identification accuracy of 93.15% is achieved. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Additive manufacturing; defect identification; directed energy deposition; machine learning; surface monitoring","3D printers; Additives; Deterioration; In situ processing; Quality assurance; Supervised learning; Surface defects; Defect identification; Directed energy; In-house software; Machine learning methods; Part quality; Point distances; Supervised machine learning; Surface monitoring; Learning systems","","","","","A*ccelerate; Machine Learning Platform for Manufacturing Equipment and Solutions, (ACCL/19-GAP025-R20A); Nanyang Technological University, NTU","This work was supported by A*ccelerate under the GAP grant for Machine Learning Platform for Manufacturing Equipment and Solutions (ACCL/19-GAP025-R20A).

Most of the study on bidirectional impulse turbines involves steady-state performance analysis; however, the performance under oscillating airflow conditions is necessary to understand its behavior. The objective of this study is to experimentally analyze an optimized and numerically investigated bidirectional impulse turbine with fixed guide vane subjected to oscillating airflow conditions. A bidirectional airflow test facility developed at Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India is employed to determine the aerodynamic characterization of the turbine and the dynamics involved in each of the coupling stages. The test rig consists of a piston chamber assembly, which provides different airflow rates by varying the stroke length (SL) and cycle time. Emphasis is made on the pressure and flow rate coefficients of the turbine, turbine-generator coupling, and power developed for different input conditions. The operating range of the turbine is mapped for four different frequencies and three SLs. Different electrical loading and the power output were analyzed for accelerations and decelerations of inflow and outflow. The preliminary dynamic characterization of the turbine with respect to nondimentionalized pressure coefficient and flow coefficient was determined for inflow and outflow. The power output is found to be in strong correlation with the flow rate and angular rotation of the rotor. The turbine analyzed in the experimental test rig will be proceeded with real sea testing on the Indian coast by the National Institute of Ocean Technology, Chennai, India. © 1976-2012 IEEE.","Bidirectional impulse (BDI) turbine; experi-mental study; oscillating flow testing; oscillating water column (OWC); wave energy conversion","Aerodynamics; Steam turbines; Wave energy conversion; Aerodynamic characterization; Dynamic characterization; Experimental investigations; Flow rate coefficients; Indian institute of technologies; Oscillating water column; Steady state performance; Wave energy converters; Oscillating flow","","","","","Ministry of Earth Sciences, एमओईएस; Earth System Sciences Organization, Ministry of Earth Sciences, ईएसएसओ, (OEC/1516/128/NIOT/ABDU); Earth System Sciences Organization, Ministry of Earth Sciences, ईएसएसओ","Manuscript received April 22, 2019; revised September 12, 2019; accepted February 24, 2020.

The WAAM alloys were characterised by the metallographic microscope, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, computed tomography and electronic universal testing machine. The results show that the secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) and hydrogen content of as-deposited WAAM alloy increase, and the tendency of pore formation increases with an increase in Mg content. The impurity Fe in the WAAM alloy with low Mg content is mainly in β-Fe phase, while with high Mg content is mainly in the π-Fe phase. After solution treating and ageing treatment (T6 heat-treat), the microstructure of WAAM alloy tends to be uniform. With the increase of Mg content, the size of eutectic silicon particles increases gradually. Furthermore, the UTS and YS of the alloys increased, and the elongation decreased. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Al-Si alloy; magnesium; microstructure and properties; porosity; WAAM; Wire and arc-based additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Computerized tomography; Iron alloys; Microstructure; Scanning electron microscopy; Ageing treatments; Eutectic silicon particles; Hydrogen contents; Metallographic microscope; Microstructure and properties; Secondary dendrite arm spacing; Solution treating; Universal testing machines; Silicon alloys","","","","","Inner Mongolia Metal Material Research Institute; NEIMM; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFB1106300-5)","Funding text 1: This work is sponsored by the National Key R&D Program of China (Item No: 2018YFB1106300-5).

This work presents a new integrated finite element (FE) simulation and machine learning approach to select a multi-layer laser infill toolpath planning strategy for fabricating quadrilateral parts to minimise localised heat accumulation during the deposition process. After one layer deposition simulation, the approach employs a Temperature-Pattern Recurrent Neural Networks (TP-RNN) model to predict the temperature field after the next layer deposition for each of the candidate infill toolpaths, and a process parameters inspired thermal field evaluation method to select the best candidate toolpath. The approach would significantly improve the computational efficiency of the laser infill toolpath planning, which was validated by improving the flatness of the 20-layer cube deposition samples with two dimensions (20 mm × 20 mm and 30 mm × 30 mm). © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Laser aided additive manufacturing; multi-layer deposition; recurrent neural networks; thermal analyses; toolpath planning","3D printers; Additives; Computational efficiency; Deposition; Infill drilling; Learning systems; Deposition process; Finite element simulations; Heat accumulation; Integrated numerical modelling; Machine learning approaches; Process parameters; Temperature patterns; Tool-path planning; Recurrent neural networks","","","","","Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR, (A1893a0031)","This research was supported by Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Republic of Singapore, under the IAF-PP program “Integrated large format hybrid manufacturing using wire-fed and powder-blown technology for LAAM process”, Grant No: A1893a0031.

A typical Foster test cell was used in order to measure the dielectric strength of a variety of oils. For a more complete picture, it requires the identification of more parameters but this paper examines only the above one as a result of the operation of a testing apparatus. It is shown that FEM/FDM analysis provides same information for the electrode gap. Bruce electrode provides highly uniform electric field. Factors such as voltage rate, relaxation time between measurements as well as the shape of the testing electrodes influences the dielectric strength of the liquid. © 2021 School of Science, IHU.

Rapid prototyping as well as retrofitting and digitization of legacy systems often need design and application of closed-loop controllers. The analysis and modelling for systems such as energy-conversion or material transport devices is labour-intensive and needs process understanding. Current identification and control toolboxes require systematic preparation of input/output data, modification and tuning of the derived models, also proper design of classic PID controllers. An on-demand service paradigm is applied to allow identification and control with direct access to the controlled system over a network connection. The identified parameters are used to adapt a model predictive controller (MPC), which stabilizes the system and drives trajectories to different operating points. To evaluate the performance of the controllers in terms of stability, accuracy, and time response, several target trajectories and disturbances (signal noise, external physical disturbances, latency in communication) were investigated. The identification service was used to model the linear dynamics of a 6-DOF industrial robot and a laboratory-scale waterworks containing two separately controllable pumps. The robot’s axes and the waterworks’ pumps were successfully controlled with current set-points by using their respective identified state-space models. Simulation and laboratory experiments show promising results for the control of diverse systems with varying time-constants, and imply broad applicability. As a major achievement, this approach enables to efficiently implement system identification and model predictive control in manufacturing. © 2021 Authors.","Industrial robots; Manufacturing as a service; Model predictive control; Process technology; System identification","Closed loop control systems; Controllers; Digital storage; Industrial robots; Legacy systems; MATLAB; Predictive control systems; State space methods; Three term control systems; 'current; Closed-loop control; Industrial manufacturing; Manufacturing as a service; Manufacturing equipment; Model-predictive control; Open platforms; Process Technologies; System-identification; Universal approach; Model predictive control","","","","","Eesti Teaduste Akadeemia; Tallinna Tehnikaülikool, TTÜ","The publication costs of this article were covered by the Estonian Academy of Sciences and Tallinn University of Technology.","Vick A., Kruger J., Using OPC UA for distributed industrial robot control, Proceedings of the 50th International Symposium on Robotics, ISR 2018, pp. 501-506, (2018); Yen C.-T., Liu Y.-C, Lin C.-C, Kao C.-C, Wang W.-B., Hsu Y.-R., Advanced manufacturing solution to industry 4.0 trend through sensing network and cloud computing technologies, Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE), pp. 1150-1152; Vick A., Guhl J., Kruger J., Model predictive control as a service: concept and architecture for use in cloud-based robot control, Proceedings of the 2016 21st International Conference on Methods and Models in Automation and Robotics (MMAR), pp. 607-612; Rudorfer M., Kruger J., Industrial image processing applications as orchestration of web services, Procedia CIRP, 76, pp. 144-148, (2018); Lambrecht J., Steffens E.

One of the remarkable features of this system is the use of scissor-like structures (SLSs) to achieve the nonlinear stiffness and damping. The length difference between the connecting rods in SLS is considered. First, both the stiffness and damping characteristics are derived and analyzed in detail. Then, the frequency response and force transmissibility are obtained using the harmonic balance method. Finally, the effects of structural parameters on the isolation performance are investigated. Theoretical results show that the proposed QZS vibration system can not only isolate low-frequency vibration but also suppress the high-amplitude vibration in the resonant region. Besides, increasing nonlinear damping has little influence on the isolation performance in high frequencies. The proposed QZS vibration system can outperform a classical counterpart. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Geometric nonlinearity; Nonlinear damping; Quasi-zero stiffness; Vibration isolation","Damping; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Frequency response; Stiffness; Tools; Classical counterpart; Geometric non-linearity; Harmonic Balance method; High-amplitude vibrations; Low-frequency vibration; Single degree of freedoms; Stiffness and damping characteristics; Vibration isolation systems; Vibration analysis","","","","","Natural Science Research Foundation of Jiangsu Normal University, (18XLRS009); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51605209); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Research of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China, (18KJD460003); Natural Science Research of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51605209), the Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China (Grant No. 18KJD460003), the Natural Science Research Foundation of Jiangsu Normal University (Grant No. 18XLRS009) and Jiangsu Government Scholarship for Studying Abroad.

In order to make AM suitable for the medical, aerospace, and automotive industries, geometry variations should be controlled and managed with a tight tolerance range. In the previously published article, the authors used statistical analysis to develop linear models for the prediction of dimensional features of laser-sintered specimens. Two identical builds with the same material, process, and build parameters were produced, resulting in 434 samples for mechanical testing (ISO 527-2 1BA). The developed linear models had low accuracy, and therefore needed an application of more advanced data analysis techniques. In this work, machine learning techniques are applied for the same data, and results are compared with the previously reported linear models. The linear regression model is the best for width. Multilayer perceptron and gradient boost regressor models have outperformed other for thickness and length. The recommendations on how the developed models can be used in the future are proposed. © 2020, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; Decision tree regressor; Dimensional accuracy; Gradient boosting regressor; Machine learning; Multilayer perceptron; PA12; Polyamide; Support vector regression","3D printers; Additives; Automotive industry; Fits and tolerances; Injection molding; Laser heating; Machine learning; Mechanical testing; Multilayer neural networks; Predictive analytics; Regression analysis; Build Parameters; Data analysis techniques; Dimensional accuracy; Geometry deviations; Geometry variations; Linear regression models; Machine learning techniques; Tight tolerances; Learning algorithms","","","","","Norges Forskningsråd, (248243); Norges Forskningsråd","Funding text 1: Funding was provided by Norges Forskningsråd (Grant No. 248243).

These changes result from mass engineering tasks, usually characterized by the complex chain of chemical, physical, and heat transfer processes impacting the baking at the same time primarily caused by a variation of two dominating factors: (i) the heat and (ii) the internal moisture content at different temperatures and during the time's process. This study presents an analysis of the 1-D computational fluid dynamics model for simultaneous heat transfer within a cylindrical bread sample. The numerical simulations were performed using the finite difference model (FDM) and the finite element model (FEM). In the first case, the proposed numerical model considered radiation and convection during sample heating and described the sample's simultaneous heat, water, and vapor diffusion mechanisms. The calculations indicated that the FDM was susceptible to the time step; consequently, the range of 10 s and 100 s yielded the only relevant results. In the second case, the FEM was used to describe the phenomena of transportation during baking. Results obtained by the FEM showed a large temperature gradient near the surface. The study showed the presence of some critical cases that are considered the most influential on the stages of bread production. The first critical value is the time when the baking temperature reaches 100° C. The second critical value is the time when the liquid water content in the baking medium reaches its peak. The boundary conditions were examined and illustrated by figures in the center and the surface of the bread.  © 2021 Heba Mosalam.","","Bakeries; Computational fluid dynamics; Food products; Numerical models; Biochemical process; Computational fluid dynamics modeling; Dominating factors; Finite difference models (FDM); Heat transfer process; Liquid water content; Numerical modeling and analysis; Radiation and convection; Heat transfer","","","","","","","Al-Nasser M., Fayssal I., Moukalled F., Numerical simulation of baking in a convection oven, Applied Thermal Engineering, 184, (2021); Reddy R.S., Arepally D., Datta A.K., Estimation of heat flux in baking by inverse problem, Journal of Food Engineering, 271, (2020); Park H.W., Yoon W.B., Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling and application for sterilisation of foods: A review, Energies, 6, 6, (2018); Tank A., Chhanwal N., Indrani D., Anandharamakrishnan C., Computational fluid dynamics modeling of bun baking process under different oven load conditions, Journal of Food Science and Technology, 51, 9, pp. 2030-2037, (2014); Therdthai N., Zhou W., Adamczak T., Three-dimensional CFD modelling and simulation of the temperature profiles and airflow patterns during a continuous industrial baking process, Journal of Food Engineering, 65, 4, pp. 599-608, (2004); Afkar H., Kianifar A., Zamani H., Investigation of the effect of variable heat flux on energy consumption and bread quality in the flat baking process by experimental and numerical methods, Energy Sources, Part A: Recovery, Utilization, and Environmental Effects, pp. 1-16, (2020); Jayapragasam P., Le B.P., Loulou T., Approximation of heat and mass transport properties for one sided cake baking, Journal of Food Engineering, 290, (2021); Khodeir M., Rouaud O., Oge A., Jury V., Le-Bail P., Le-Bail A., Study of continuous cake pre-baking in a rectangular channel using ohmic heating, Innovative Food Science & Emerging Technologies, 67, (2021); Chhanwal N., Indrani D., Raghavarao K.S., Anandharamakrishnan C., Computational fluid dynamics modeling of baking process, Food Research International, 44, 4, pp. 978-983, (2011); Zheleva I., Kambourova V., Identification of heat and mass transfer processes in bread during baking, Thermal Science, 9, 2, pp. 73-86, (2005); Zhang J., Datta A.K., Mathematical modeling of bread baking process, Journal of Food Engineering, 75, 1, pp. 78-89, (2006); Purlis E., Salvadori V.O., Bread baking as a moving boundary problem.

High stress concentrations in these plates can result in hardware failure. Topology optimization (TO) could reduce the peak stress by computing the most optimal material distribution in a patient-specific implant (PSI) used for mandibular reconstruction. The objective of this study was biomechanical validation of a TO-PSI. Methods: A computer-aided design (CAD) model with a segmental defect was created based on the geometry of a polyurethane mandible model. A standard-PSI was designed to bridge the defect. A TO-PSI was then designed with a maximum stress equal to the ultimate tensile stress of Ti6Al4V (930 MPa) during a loading condition of 378 N. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to analyze stresses in both PSI designs during loading. The standard-PSI and TO-PSI designs were produced in triplicate by selective laser melting of Ti6Al4V, fixated to polyurethane mandible models with segmental defects identical to the CAD model, and subsequently subjected to continuous compression with a speed of 1 mm/min on a universal testing machine, while recording the load. Peak loads before failure in the TO-PSI group within a 30% range of the predicted peak load (378 N) were considered a successful biomechanical validation. Results: Fracture of the TO-PSI occurred at a median peak load of 334 N (range 304–336 N). These values are within the 30% range of the predicted peak load. Fracture of the mandible model in the standard-PSI group occurred at a median peak load of 1100 N (range 1010–1460 N). Failure locations during biomechanical testing of TO-PSI and standard-PSI samples corresponded to regions in the FEA where stresses exceeded the ultimate tensile strength of titanium and polyurethane, respectively. Conclusion: This study demonstrates a successful preliminary biomechanical validation of TO in the design process for mandibular reconstruction plates. Further work is needed to refine the finite element model, which is necessary to ultimately design TO-PSIs for clinical use. © 2020 The Authors","Biomechanical validation; Finite element analysis; Mandibular reconstruction; Patient-specific implant; Topology optimization","Biomechanical Phenomena; Bone Plates; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Mandible; Mandibular Reconstruction; Stress, Mechanical; Aluminum alloys; Biomechanics; Bridges; Defects; Finite element method; Polyurethanes; Selective laser melting; Stress analysis; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Topology; Vanadium alloys; polyurethan; titanium; Biomechanical testing; Computer aided design models; High stress concentration; Mandibular reconstruction; Reconstruction plates; Ultimate tensile strength; Ultimate tensile stress; Universal testing machines; Article; biomechanics; compression; computer aided design; cortical bone; finite element analysis; force; geometry; human; jaw malformation; mandible reconstruction; mathematical computing; priority journal; selective laser melting; tensile strength; topology optimization; trabecular bone; biomechanics; bone plate; mandible; mechanical stress; Computer aided design","","polyurethan, 61789-63-7; titanium, 7440-32-6","","","","","Al-Ali M.A., Al-Ali M.A., Takezawa A., Kitamura M., Topology optimization and fatigue analysis of temporomandibular joint prosthesis, World J.

A physics-based mechanical threshold stress (MTS) model is proposed to consider the material internal attributes, such as grain size and dislocation to dislocation barrier during simulation of the material flow stress and deformation. This model is based on the dislocation dynamics and thermal activation theory with a combination of three main components of athermal stress, thermal stress, and threshold stress. The MTS flow stress model is embedded into a fully coupled thermo-mechanical incremental plasticity model to predict the residual stress during AM processes from the prediction of temperature field and associated thermal stresses. The experimental measurements of residual stress are conducted on additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4 V samples for the model validation. The proposed model provides insight into the impact of microstructure on residual stress prediction in the additive manufacturing process modeling. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd. part of Springer Nature.","Additive manufacturing;

The durability of the bridge is increased by stiffness, strength to weight ratio, and corrosion resistance. The main factors on which the design of the composite sandwiched bridge considerably depends are ply layers, material system, alignment of ply angles, and thickness of the core. In this work, a parametric design study for a bridge using finite element analysis (FEA) is presented. Two types of composite materials—carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) and glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP)—were used as the sandwich structure’s skin, and three different types of woods were used as a core. Different design configurations were acquired based on material and instability constraints by using Euro-codes. Failure criterion of Tsai-Hill, Tsai-Wu, MS, equivalent stress, and maximum shear stress were implemented to analyze the overall failure of the bridge deck under Ultimate Limit State (ULS) conditions. The total deformation was examined under Serviceability Limit State (SLS) conditions, and the results were compared and verified by the previous study. The core was also examined using the core-factor and increasing the thickness of the core through parametric modeling. © 2020 by the authors.

The nonlinearity of a laser's input-output transfer function can degrade the performance of an FMCW LiDAR. However, traditional discrete-time electro-optical phase-locked loops (DT-EOPLLs) face an unfavorable trade-off between chirp bandwidth and Mach-Zehnder delay. We present an integrated continuous-time electro-optic phase-locked loop (CT-EOPLL) to address this problem. The proposed EOPLL is very wideband, with its loop bandwidth equal to its reference frequency. This feature enables it to relax the trade-off between chirp bandwidth and Mach-Zehnder (MZ) delay by 10 × in dB scale, which consequently reduces the area and loss associated with the silicon photonic delay implementation. It also does not suffer from the challenging issue of spurs in wideband PLLs because it features image and harmonic spur suppression in the loop using single-sideband (SSB) and harmonic-reject (HR) mixing techniques.

An issue that prevents a larger development of DED is the reliability of the process, since its complexity makes the result of the manufacturing variable. Thermal behavior is a critical aspect for which uncontrolled phenomena can lead to part failure. Some thermal monitoring and closed-loop control methods have been developed, that enables to observe and regulate the heating of the processed part. However, these methods rely on local measures from a region or a single external surface of a part, and thus provide partial information of thermal fields in the whole part volume. This paper proposes a method that combines diverse data to compute online a process indicator that is meaningful for the thermal state of the whole part, and hence for the control of the manufacturing of multi-beads multi-layer parts. A simulation-based model using thermal partial data is proposed. An online monitoring experiment is proposed for validation of the model. Relevance of the control method to ensure mechanical properties of the part is then tested. © 2021, Editorial Institution of Wrocaw Board of Scientific.

The role of irradiance in the multijet fusion (MJF) process has not been addressed by any previous research, despite the key role of this process in the AM industry. The aim of this paper is to explore the relationship between irradiance and dimensional accuracy in MJF. Design/methodology/approach: An experimental activity was carried out to map the relationship between irradiance and dimensional accuracy in the MJF transformation of polyamide 12. Two specimens were used to measure the dimensional accuracy on medium and small sizes. The experiment was run using six different levels of irradiance. For each, the crystallinity degree and part density were measured. Findings: Irradiance was found to be directly proportional to part density and inversely proportional to crystallinity degree. Higher irradiance leads to an increase in the measured dimensions of parts. This highlights a predominant role of the crystallisation degree and uncontrolled peripherical sintering, in line with the previous literature on other powder-bed AM processes. The results demonstrate that different trends can be observed according to the range of sizes. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Additive manufacturing; Dimensional accuracy; Irradiance; Multijet fusion; Polyamide 12","Additives; Crystallinity; Sintering; Crucial parameters; Crystallinity degree; Design/methodology/approach; Dimensional accuracy; Experimental activities; Poly-amide 12; Powder bed; Radiated energies; 3D printers","","","","","Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR","The authors would like to thank the MIUR (Italian Ministry of University and Research) for funding support and Juno Design S.r.l. for laboratory facilities.

Two three-dimensional anatomically accurate numerical models are reconstructed based on the CT-scan of one severe obstructive sleep apnea patient for both pre- and post-surgery. Two experimental models of the same upper airway are established by using the three-dimensional printing technique according to the numerical models. The first direct comparison of flow velocity profiles between measurement and simulation at different locations and cross-sections is conducted in two upper airway models. The simulated result indicates that the especially large axial velocity and negative pressure appear in the narrowest cross-section before surgery, but they either reduce or vanish after surgery. Both measurement and simulation can capture the “pharyngeal jet” flow and the reversed flow in two upper airway models, and the agreement between the measured and calculated velocity profiles at different locations and cross-sections is excellent, which gives us great confidence that the large eddy simulation can be a reliable method for predicting the flow features associated with obstructive sleep apnea airway. Although this work represents significant advance, there still exists some limitations, such as the discrepancies between measurement and simulation in the interface of main stream velocity and reverse velocity due to the flow complexity, in the reversed flow region owing to the uncertainty of laser Doppler anemometry measurement at low velocity range, and the incapability of capturing flow near the wall due to the intrinsic feature of laser Doppler anemometry measurement. Besides, it is very difficult to find the corresponding locations exactly between experimental and numerical models, which could also cause the deviation between experiment and simulation. © IMechE 2020.","flow feature; large eddy simulation; laser Doppler anemometry; Obstructive sleep apnea; velocity profile","3D printers; Anemometers; Classifiers; Computerized tomography; Doppler effect; Flow measurement; Flow velocity; Large eddy simulation; Laser Doppler velocimeters; Laser surgery; Location; Respiratory mechanics; Sleep research; Surgery; Three dimensional computer graphics; Uncertainty analysis; Velocity; Experimental models; Intrinsic features; Laser Doppler anemometry; Low-velocity range; Measurement and simulation; Negative pressures; Obstructive sleep apnea; Velocity profiles; Numerical models","","","","","NSF of Zhejiang, (LQ20E060006, LY18A020007); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11872062)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by the NSF of China (Grant No. 11872062) and NSF of Zhejiang (Grant No. LY18A020007 and LQ20E060006).","McCabe C., Hardinge M., Obstructive sleep apnoea, Pract Nurse, 41, pp. 36-41, (2011); Brooks D., Horner R.L., Kozar L.F., Et al., Obstructive sleep apnea as a cause of systemic hypertension: evidence from a canine model, J Clin Investig, 99, pp. 106-109, (1997); Pamidi S., Aronsohn R.S., Tasali E., Obstructive sleep apnea: role in the risk and severity of diabetes, Best Pract Res Clin Endocrinol Metab, 24, pp. 703-715, (2010); Dyken M.E., Somers V.K., Yamada T., Et al., Investigating the relationship between stroke and obstructive sleep apnea, Stroke, 27, pp. 401-407, (1996); Soose R.J., Strollo P.J., Obstructive sleep apnea: surgery, Essentials of Sleep Medicine, (2012); Thesis, (2016); Jeong S.J., Kim W.S., Sung S.J., Numerical investigation on the flow characteristics and aerodynamic force of the upper airway of patient with obstructive sleep apnea using computational fluid dynamics, Med Eng Phys, 29, pp. 637-651, (2007); Mihaescu M., Murugappan S., Gutmark E., Et al., Computational fluid dynamics analysis of upper airway reconstructed from magnetic resonance imaging data, Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol, 117, pp. 303-309, (2008); Sun D., Li F.S., Xu X.X., Et al., Numerical simulation study on airflow structural characteristics in real human airways model, Appl Mech Mater, 184-185, pp. 348-351, (2012); Mylavarapu G., Computational flow modeling of human upper airway breathing.

In this study, we investigate the potential of single- (SL) and multi-layer (ML) arsenene phases (buckled and symmetric washboard) to be used as an anode material by means of abinitio calculations. The interaction of alkali metal atoms (M: Li, Na, and K) with arsenene is examined to reveal strong adatom-electrode binding and low diffusion barriers. Provided that the initial crystalline patterns are maintained, the possible M orderings (MxAs) are investigated for varying ion concentrations (x). The structural deformations and the decrease in formation energy with increasing x indicate probable structural transformations. The abinitio molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the ordered patterns are prone to instability and crystalline to amorphous transition is induced at ambient temperature. The calculated (average) open-circuit voltages are between 0.65–0.98 V with the specific capacity range of 358–715 mAhg−1 for SL- and ML-MxAs. Strong metal-electrode interaction, fast diffusion, and desired voltage range suggest arsenene as a promising anode material for alkali-ion batteries to be utilized in low charging voltage applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","","Diffusion barriers; Ions; Molecular dynamics; Nanocrystalline materials; Open circuit voltage; Secondary batteries; Ab initio calculations; Ab-initio molecular dynamics; Crystalline patterns; Crystalline-to-amorphous; Required functionalities; Specific capacities; Structural deformation; Structural transformation; Anodes","","","","","National Center for High Performance Computing of Turkey; TUBITAK; UHeM; Ulusal Yüksek Başarımlı Hesaplama Merkezi, Istanbul Teknik Üniversitesi, UHeM, (5007092019); Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştirma Kurumu, TÜBITAK, (117F241)","Funding text 1: The calculations were performed at TUBITAK ULAKBIM, High Performance and Grid Computing Center (TR-Grid e-Infrastructure) and the National Center for High Performance Computing of Turkey (UHeM) under grant no. 5007092019.

Statistical analysis of the distribution of material by subspaces revealed some relationship between construction features and the effectiveness of part decomposition. The initial triangulated model was converted into a voxel model, and the latter is analyzed with the proposed algorithm. The workspace of an AM machine was divided into subspaces of the same volume with parallel steadily distributed planes perpendicular to the coordinate axes. Based on the models of typical industrial parts, it was proving that the algorithm was able to analyze the effectiveness of part decomposition. Moreover, some indexes were proposed to allow the quantitative analysis of part decomposition and packing (workspace planning task) effectiveness. The proposed index of the specific volume of utilised workspace enabled the minimising of the cost of given parts by using AM processes. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Additive manufacturing;

Both in situ X-ray radiography and ex situ X-ray computed tomography were used to explore the mechanisms that contribute to nozzle clogging. Three inks were considered, with fiber volume fractions ranging from 1% to 5.75%, and nominal fiber lengths from 150 to 470 µm. These results showed that the specific mechanisms that produced the clog depended substantially on the fiber volume fraction, fiber length and nozzle geometry. Specific clogging mechanisms included the log-jam pileup of misoriented fibers near the nozzle tip, the lodging of a fiber entanglement in the nozzle tip, and the accumulation of misoriented fibers at step-like reductions in the nozzle profile. Suggestions to reduce the prevalence of nozzle clogging are presented. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Ceramic matrix composite; Direct write; Nozzle clogging; Polymer matrix composite","3D printers; Computerized tomography; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Filled polymers; Nozzles; Volume fraction; X rays; Additive manufacturing process; Clogging mechanism; Fiber reinforced composites; Fiber volume fractions; Geometric accuracy; Nozzle clogging; Nozzle geometries; Printing process; X ray radiography","","","","","U.S. Department of Defense, DOD; Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL, (FA8650-19-2-5220, FA9453-18-2-0009); Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL; U.S. Air Force, USAF; University of Tennessee, UT; Government of South Australia","Funding text 1: This work is based upon research conducted at the Materials Solutions Network at CHESS (MSN-C) which is supported by the Air Force Research Laboratory under award FA8650-19-2-5220.

This review paper highlights many of the recent successes and challenges associated with the utilization of “3 D printed” heat sinks for applications in electronics cooling. The purpose is to evaluate the current state of the art in additively manufactured thermal management solutions and the underlying physics and engineering approaches that illustrate the great promise of this emerging sector. The emphasis is therefore not only on the underlying strengths of additive manufacturing, such as its ability to greatly expand the realm of spatial and surface design for heat transfer, but also to illustrate some of its drawbacks that hinder its utilities in certain applications, such as the dearth of materials it can handle. This work looks toward future possibilities of custom designed heat removal schemes which utilize nontraditional geometries that were previously impossible using conventional machining methods. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Additives; Electronic cooling; Heat sinks; Thermal Engineering; Conventional machining; Electronics cooling; Heat sink design; Manufacturing technologies; Review papers; State of the art; Surface design; Thermal dissipation; 3D printers","","","","","Center for Power Optimization of Electro-Thermal Systems","The authors would like to thank the Center for Power Optimization of Electro-Thermal Systems for their support during this work.","Tummala R., Fundamentals of Microsystems Packaging, (2001); Refrigerating and air-conditioning engineers, Datacom Equipment Power Trends and Cooling Applications, (2012); Kheirabadi A.C., Groulx D., Cooling of server electronics: a design review of existing technology, Appl.

By observing these solutions, the recycling system from the waste collection and separation system of the long-term disappearing of polymer waste to the additive manufacturing design stage has been indicated. Waste collection and separation systems have been reviewed and systems to be used effectively in the systematic way have been exemplified. Among four different separating systems which are with rotating, rail and fixed containers, fixed container four-sorting waste separation systems were chosen and developed as a mechatronic system design. The mechatronic system design is very prominent in order to create efficient and economical mechanisms in fixed-container four-sorting waste separation collection system (FCWS) applications. In addition, physical mechatronic system design (MSD), mechanical design, material selection, electrical electronic design sub-heading and cost analysis were made. In this study, the necessity and importance of the waste separation plants are revealed. © 2021, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

Several experimental anatomic models were made with additive manufacturing techniques to improve geometric, radiological, or mechanical realism. However, reproducing the mechanical behavior of soft tissues remains a challenge. To solve this problem, multi-material structuring of soft and hard materials was proposed in this study, and a three-dimensional (3D) printer was built to make such structuring possible. The printer relies on extrusion to deposit certain thermoplastic and silicone rubber materials. Various objects were successfully printed for testing the feasibility of geometric features such as thin walls, infill structuring, overhangs, and multi-material interfaces. Finally, a small medical image-based ribcage model was printed as a proof of concept for anatomic model printing. The features enabled by this printer offer a promising outlook on mimicking the mechanical properties of various soft tissues. © 2021. Jaksa, et al.

This type of VTOL aircraft may suffer from terrible drag due to the copter rotors. To tackle this problem, this paper describes a novel rotors retractable hybrid VTOL UAV (RR VTOL) that combines the hovering capability of multicopters and the high cruise velocity property of pure fixed-wing aircraft. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis on rotors folding and unfolding models proves that the retractable rotors can increase the lift-to-drag ratio by approximately two times compared to that of the common hybrid VTOL UAV. Moreover, some aerodynamic performance data of the rotors folded model are also acquired. A preliminary design method for this creative UAV is proposed with new empirical equations derived from many hybrid VTOL UAVs' data. Emphasis is given to the method for determining the center of gravity position and horizontal tail dimensions as they are the unique aspects of the RR VTOL configuration. Subsequently, the manufacturing process and rotor retraction mechanism of two UAV generations are reviewed and a rapid prototyping method for RR VTOL is summarized. Finally, a successful flight test confirms that the proposed VTOL concept is practical and the drag reduction of rotors retracting function is remarkable. © 2013 IEEE.","flight test; prototyping; rotors retractable; sizing; UAV design; VTOL","Computational fluid dynamics; Design; Drag; Fixed wings; Lift drag ratio; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); VTOL/STOL aircraft; Atmospheric modeling; Automotive component; Design method; Flight test; Payload; Preliminary design; Prototyping; Rotor retractable; Sizing; UAV designs; Aircraft landing","","","","","Beijing Advanced Discipline Center for Unmanned Aircraft System","This work was supported by the Foundation of Beijing Advanced Discipline Center for Unmanned Aircraft System, Beijing, China.","Liu K., Development and trend analysis of VTOL aircraft (in Chinese), Adv.

The ellipses can be continuously translated and rotated. Restrictions on the dimensions of the ellipses are taken into account. Tools for the mathematical modelling of placement constraints (distance constraints between ellipses and containment of ellipses into a polygonal domain) using the phi-function technique are introduced. The tools make it possible to formulate the layout problem in the form of MIP model that is equivalent to a sequence of nonlinear programming subproblems. We develop a new solution algorithm that involves the feasible starting point algorithm and optimisation procedure to search for efficient locally optimal solutions of the layout problem. This algorithm can be used in the design of parts for «support-free» additive manufacturing, taking into account the conditions for its static/ dynamic strength.

Among them, heart-on-a-chip has emerged in recent years as a method for constructing disease (or normal) models in vitro and is considered as a promising tool to study heart diseases. Compared with other methods, the advantages of heart-on-a-chip include the high portability, high throughput, and the capability to mimic microenvironments in vivo. It has shown a great potential in disease mechanism study and drug screening. In this paper, we review the recent advances in heart-on-a-chip, including the fabrication methods (e.g., 3D bioprinting) and biomedical applications. By analyzing the structure of the existing heart-on-a-chip, we proposed that a highly integrated heart-on-a-chip includes four elements: Microfluidic chips, cells/microtissues, microactuators to construct the microenvironment, and microsensors for results readout. Finally, the current challenges and future directions of heart-on-a-chip are discussed. © 2021. Yang, et al.

The sensing platform is modular in design incorporating interchangeable optical detection units, with a component cost per unit of ca. €300, and small form factor (20 cm × 6 cm x 3.5 cm). Laboratory testing and validation of the platform was performed prior to deployment at the CNR Dirigibile Italia Arctic Research Station, Ny-Aselund (79°N, 12°E). Results obtained showed excellent linear response, with a limit of detection of 0.05 μM (NO2−, NO3−), and 0.03 μM (PO43−). On the June 22, 2016 a field campaign took place within Kongsfjorden, Ny-Aselund (78.5–79°N, 11.6–12.6°E), during which 55 water samples were acquired using 10 L Niskin bottles on board the MS Teisten research vessel. 23 hydrological casts were also performed using a Seabird 19plus V2 SeaCAT Profiler CTD probe with turbidity and dissolved oxygen sensors. Water samples were subsequently analyzed for PO43−, NO2−, NO3− at the CNR Dirigibile Italia Arctic Research Station Laboratory using the adaptive sensing platform. Nutrient concentrations were compared to hydrological data to assess the processes that influence the nutrient concentrations within the Fjord. This research highlights the potential use of the adaptive sensing platform in remote locations as a stand-alone platform and/or for the validation of deployable environmental sensor networks.

The image processing workflow was developed to process and analyze large amount of data objectively by computer program. The distribution of size and shape of the metal particles as well as defect (mainly porosity) inside the particles was analyzed with the statistical representation and resolution in micrometer. The result revealed that circular-shaped porosity with various sizes could be embedded in the powder particles. These porosities could potentially be transferred to the 3D printed part and critically affect the mechanical performance of the component. The present study shows the effectiveness of characterizing metal powders using x-ray imaging techniques where sufficient number of particles can be sampled within tens of minutes with a minimum sample preparation and high accuracy. Clear structural differences in the as-received and recycled powders were delineated that helps in determining the feasibility of using the recycled powders. © 2020, ASM International.","additive manufacturing; advanced characterization; x-ray tomography","3D printers; Additives; Aluminum alloys; Computerized tomography; Metals; Particle size analysis; Porosity; Recycling; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Additive manufacturing process; Distribution of size; High energy X ray; Mechanical performance; Sample preparation; Statistical representations; Structural differences; X-ray imaging techniques; Powder metals","","","","","Office of Science Laboratory, (DE-AC02-06CH11357); US Department of Energy; US Department of Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing Office; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; Argonne National Laboratory, ANL","Support for this work was partially provided by the US Department of Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing Office at Argonne National Laboratory, a US Department of Energy’s Office of Science Laboratory operated under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357 by UChicago Argonne, LLC.

Herein, we report on the use of high-intensity ultrasound that controls the process of solidification during AM of 316L stainless steel. We find that the use of ultrasound favours the columnar-to-equiaxed transition, promoting the formation of fine equiaxed grains with random crystallographic texture. Moreover, the use of ultrasound increases the number density of grains from 305 mm−2 to 2748 mm−2 despite an associated decrease in cooling rate and temperature gradient in the melt pool during AM. Our assessment of the relationship between grain size and cooling rate indicates that the formation of crystallites during AM is enhanced by ultrasound. Furthermore, the use of ultrasound increases the amount of constitutional supercooling during solidification by lowering the temperature gradient in the bulk of the melt pool, thus creating an environment that favours nucleation, growth, and survival of grains. This new understanding provides opportunities to better exploit ultrasound to control grain structure in AM-fabricated metal products. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Grain refinement; Steel; Ultrasonic treatment; Ultrasound","Additives; Cooling; Crystallites; Grain refinement; Grain size and shape; Metallurgy; Solidification; Textures; Thermal gradients; Ultrasonics; 316 L stainless steel; Columnar to equiaxed transition; Constitutional supercooling; Crystallographic textures; Fine equiaxed grains; High intensity ultrasounds; Melting and solidification; Metals and alloys; 3D printers","","","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (280421, FP7-NMP3-LA-2012-280421); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7; European Space Agency, ESA; Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP140100702, DP150104719, DP160100560); Australian Research Council, ARC","This research work was supported by the Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Projects DP150104719 , DP160100560 , DP140100702 and the ExoMet Project co-funded by the European Commission Seventh Framework Programme (contract FP7-NMP3-LA-2012-280421 ), by the European Space Agency and by the individual partner organisations.

To this end, we detail a manufacturing framework for the design and production of application-specific cutting tools based on industry standard tungsten carbide-cobalt (WC-Co)-based “carbide” cutting materials using additive manufacturing (AM). Herein, novel diamond-reinforced carbide structures were designed and manufactured via AM and subsequently tested in comparison to current commercial products that are traditionally-processed. The resulting diamond-reinforced composites were free from large scale cracking and maintained microstructures with multiple reinforcing phases. Diamond incorporation had a remarkable effect on the processing, microstructure, and machining performance of the WC-Co based material in comparison to a commercial carbide cutting tool of similar composition, as well as the base WC-Co matrix. Detailed microstructure, phase analysis, and machining experiments demonstrate the ability to exploit laser-based directed energy deposition (DED)-based AM to create multifunctional cutting tools that can be designed to meet ever-increasing manufacturing demands across many industries. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Cutting-Tool materials; Diamond reinforcement; Directed-Energy-Deposition; Tungsten carbide","3D printers; Additives; Carbide cutting tools; Cutting; Diamonds; Machine tools; Microstructure; Reinforcement; Tungsten carbide; Application specific; Commercial products; Innovative manufacturing; Laser-based additive manufacturing; Machining experiments; Machining performance; Reinforced composites; Tungsten carbide cobalt; Diamond cutting tools","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (NSF-CMMI 1934230); National Institutes of Health, NIH, (R01 AR067306); National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIAMS; University of Idaho, UI","Authors would like to acknowledge financial support from the National Science Foundation under the grant number NSF-CMMI 1934230 (PI - Bandyopadhyay), and the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number R01 AR067306.

Manufacturing of aluminum alloys for e.g. structural components of the aero plane fuselage by this technology has been impeded by the unavailability of high-performance alloys with good processability and low susceptibility to hot cracking. Therefore, a novel alloy system has been developed based on the Al-Zn-Mg-Cu system and successfully processed by WAAM without the occurrence of any hot cracks. Heat treatment strategies were developed allowing for optimum mechanical properties. A homogeneous grain structure was observed with few elongated grains. Upon heat treatment, the formation of T phases was verified with a precipitate size in the range of ~10 nm. These are responsible for the observed pronounced age-hardening response of this alloy. An isotropic proof stress of up to ~340 MPa and a fracture strain of up to ~11% are evidence of the high quality of the WAAM deposited material allowing for an extended use of these alloys for advanced applications. Finally, the applicability and processability of the alloy was proven by fabrication of a motorcycle piston. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Heat treatment; High-performance aluminum alloys; Mechanical properties; Microstructure evolution; Wire-arc additive manufacturing","3D printers; Additives; Age hardening; Copper alloys; Cracks; Deposition rates; Heat treatment; Magnesium alloys; Zinc alloys; Advanced applications; Al -Zn-Mg-Cu alloys; Deposited materials; Hardening response; High deposition rates; Medium complexity; Metallic component; Structural component; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (859833); Österreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft, FFG; Bundesministerium für Verkehr, Innovation und Technologie, BMVIT; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","This research was funded within frame of the program M-Era.Net by the Austrian Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology (BMVIT) administered by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) and the Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT, Portugal) within the project HiPA 2 l (“High Performance Additive manufacturing of Aluminium alloys”) (grant no. 859833 ) and by the European Regional Development Fund (EFRE) in the framework of the EU-program ""IWB Investition in Wachstum und Beschäftigung Österreich 2014–2020"" and the federal state of Upper Austria.

Here, a bi-material metamaterial was constructed. The material extrusion process was established to fabricate the metamaterial. The measured CTEs in various in-plane directions are in good consistency to each other, experimentally verifying the identical CTE in various in-plane directions. The relative deviation between the experimental measurements and theoretical predictions is within −13.0% to +11.0%. The positive programmable CTEs are as high as 204 and 258 ppm/°C, which are larger than those of the basic polymers nylon and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Otherwise, the negative CTEs of −25 and −77 ppm/°C are obtained, even though both the nylon and PVA have positive CTEs. The programmable CTEs are expanded to be [−77, +258] ppm/°C, far beyond the literature results, supplementing the additive manufacturing and experimental basis to the engineering applications. © 2021 The Author(s).

The proportion of N2 in shielding gas greatly affected the formation quality and microstructure of deposited parts. As N2 proportion improved, the formation quality became worse gradually and the nitrogen concentration of deposition metal increased. The maximum nitrogen concentration of deposition metal was more than 1%. However, N2 porosity in the deposition metal became serious when the N2 content was over 10 %. The microstructure of the deposition metal changed from two phases of austenite and ferrite in shielding gas of 0∼10 %N2 to complete austenite with 15 %∼25 %N2 content in shielding gas. With optimal shielding gas of 5%N2+2%O2+10%He+83%Ar, the deposited parts of HNASS demonstrated good formation and excellent properties.

As patient’s bio‐signals may be included in a control loop of these devices, they may be also used to support the motion of extremities in an everyday life. Therefore, a field of control over them stays a popular research topic. For this reason, an exoskeleton described in a paper was designed. The most important aim of a project was to enable all anatomical movements within ranges required for the lifting of an object while minimising a mass of the device. The following paper consist of a concept of an exoskeleton and description of FEM simulations and topology optimisation applied to decrease the amount of material needed. Moreover, as an exoskeleton was built with FFF 3‐D printing technology, created parts are modelled orthotopically based on nominal mechanical parameters of filaments and directions of their beams. The design is complemented with a short description of control with EMG signals and analysis of load on a user’s muscu loskeletal system. © 2021, Industrial Research Institute for Automation and Measurements.

They have the potential to differentiate into various cell types, such as osseous cells, neurons and glial cells. Three-dimensional (3 D) printing is a novel method to construct biological structures by rapid prototyping. Previously, our group reported on the stemness and multi-lineage differentiation potential of EMSCs on gels. However, the exploration of EMSCs in 3 D printing and then evaluation of the growth and neuronal differentiation of EMSCs on extruded 3 D printable hybrid hydrogels has not been reported. Therefore, the current study explored the novel hybrid Sodium alginate-Matrigel (SA-MA) hydrogel extruded 3 D printing to design an in vitro scaffold to promote the differentiation and growth of EMSCs. In addition, the physical properties of the hydrogel were characterized and its drug-releasing property determined. Notably, the results showed that the construct exhibited a sustain-released effect of growth factor BDNF in accordance with the Higuchi equation. Moreover, the cell survival rate on the 3 D printed scaffold was 88.22 ± 1.13% with higher neuronal differentiation efficiency compared with 2 D culture. Thus, SA-MA’s ability to enhanced EMSCs neuronal differentiation offers a new biomaterial for neurons regeneration in the treatment of spinal cord injury. © The Author(s) 2020.","3D bioprinting; ectomesenchymal stem cells; hydrogel; neuronal differentiation","Alginates; Animals; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Collagen; Drug Carriers; Drug Combinations; Drug Liberation; Female; Humans; Hydrogels; Laminin; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Nasal Bone; Neurogenesis; Neurons; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Proteoglycans; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Skin; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; Viscosity; Controlled drug delivery; Cytology; Hydrogels; Neurons; Scaffolds (biology); Sodium; Sodium alginate; Stem cells; Targeted drug delivery; alginic acid; biomaterial; hydrogel; matrigel; alginic acid; brain derived neurotrophic factor; collagen; drug carrier; laminin; matrigel; proteoglycan; Adult stem cells; Biological structures; Higuchi equation; Hybrid hydrogels; Neuron differentiation; Neuronal differentiation; Spinal cord injuries (SCI); Three-dimensional (3D) printing; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell growth; cell proliferation; cell survival rate; cell viability; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; ectomesenchymal stem cell; female; gelation; in vitro study; mesenchymal stem cell; molecular stability; nerve cell differentiation; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; spinal cord injury; Sprague Dawley rat; sustained drug release; three dimensional printing; two dimensional cell culture; viscosity; animal; cell culture; cell differentiation; chemistry; classification; cytology; drug combination; drug effect; drug release; human; hydrogel; mesenchymal stem cell; metabolism; nasal bone; nerve cell; nervous system development; skin; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; 3D printers","","alginic acid, 28961-37-7, 29894-36-8, 9005-32-7, 9005-38-3; matrigel, 119978-18-6; brain derived neurotrophic factor, 218441-99-7; collagen, 9007-34-5; laminin, 2408-79-9; Alginates, ; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, ; Collagen, ; Drug Carriers, ; Drug Combinations, ; Hydrogels, ; Laminin, ; matrigel, ; Proteoglycans, ","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, en:NSFC, NNSF, NNSFC, (81720108030, 81773695, 81803475); National Natural Science Foundation of China, en:NSFC, NNSF, NNSFC; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, (2017M621658, 2017M621659); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","","Bindu H., Srilatha B., Potency of various types of stem cells and their transplantation, J Stem Cell Res Ther, 1, (2011); Shende P., Subedi M., Pathophysiology, mechanisms and applications of mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of spinal cord injury, Biomed Pharmacother, 91, pp. 693-706, (2017); Kim N., Cho S.-G., Clinical applications of mesenchymal stem cells, Korean J Intern Med, 28, pp. 387-402, (2013); Forni P.E., Wray S., Neural crest and olfactory system: new prospective, Mol Neurobiol, 46, pp. 349-360, (2012); Le Douarin N.M., Dupin E., Multipotentiality of the neural crest, Curr Opin Genet Dev, 13, pp. 529-536, (2003); Dupin E., Sommer L., Neural crest progenitors and stem cells: from early development to adulthood, Dev Biol, 366, pp. 83-95, (2012); Zhang Z., He Q., Deng W., Et al., Nasal ectomesenchymal stem cells: multi-lineage differentiation and transformation effects on fibrin gels, Biomaterials, 49, pp. 57-67, (2015); Fan R., Piou M., Darling E., Et al., Bio-printing cell-laden matrigel–agarose constructs, J Biomater Appl, 31, pp. 684-692, (2016); Ozbolat I.T., Peng W., Ozbolat V., Application areas of 3D bioprinting, Drug Discov Today, 21, pp. 1257-1271, (2016); Murphy S.V., Atala A., 3D bioprinting of tissues and organs, Nat Biotechnol, 32, pp. 773-785, (2014); Cui X., Breitenkamp K., Finn M., Et al., Direct human cartilage repair using three-dimensional bioprinting technology, Tissue Eng Part A, 18, pp. 1304-1312, (2012); Skardal A., Mack D., Kapetanovic E., Et al., Bioprinted amniotic fluid‐derived stem cells accelerate healing of large skin wounds, Stem Cells Transl Med, 1, pp. 792-802, (2012); Tan Y., Richards D.J., Trusk T.C., Et al., 3D printing facilitated scaffold-free tissue unit fabrication, Biofabrication, 6, (2014); Ahmad A.A., Wang Y., Gracz A.D., Et al., Optimization of 3-D organotypic primary colonic cultures for organ-on-chip applications, J Biol Eng, 8, (2014); Lu Y.-C., Song W., An D., Et al., Designing compartmentalized hydrogel microparticles for cell encapsulation and scalable 3D cell culture, J Mater Chem B, 3, pp. 353-360, (2015); Radotra B., McCormick D., Glioma invasion in vitro is mediated by CD44–hyaluronan interactions, J.

Although various kinds of NS mechanical metamaterials have been proposed, one configuration cannot simultaneously achieve multi-stability and mono-stability. This paper presented a novel multifunctional NS mechanical metamaterial structure, which possessed tailored functions of multi-stable and compressive mono-stable state without geometrical parameters adjustment. The novel multifunctional NS mechanical metamaterial structure with a conical shape consisted of both soft and hard material part and was fabricated by additive manufacturing technology. NS behaviors were achieved by the instability of the soft counterpart. Mechanical performance of this novel multifunctional NS mechanical metamaterial structure under axial compression was experimentally and numerically investigated. Influences of geometrical parameters tailoring stable state were systematically investigated and the ratio of offset distance, tilt angle, slenderness were found the key factors. Effective methods to make sure the tri-layer metamaterial structure achieving multi-stable after unloading from completely compacted state were proposed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Multi-stable and compressive mono-stable; Multifunctional mechanical metamaterial structure; Negative stiffness; Tailored function","3D printers; Geometry; Stiffness; Unloading; Additive manufacturing technology; Application prospect; Mechanical performance; Metamaterial structures; Multi stabilities; Negative stiffness; Offset distances; Parameters adjustment; Metamaterials","","","","","CAST Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program, (2017QNRC001); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11572059, 11972096); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing, (cstc2018jcyjAX0089); Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing","Supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 11972096 and 11572059 ), CAST Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program ( 2017QNRC001 ) and Chongqing Natural Science Foundation ( cstc2018jcyjAX0089 ) are gratefully acknowledged.

Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, has been envisioned as a competent fabrication process to achieve this goal. Here, we elaborate some representative AM and self-assembly methods to manufacture 3D-architectured graphene and its diversified composites. The challenges and difficulties to formulate printable graphene materials and optimize the manufacturing processes are also discussed to provide guidance for further research. Moreover, the features and advantages of each 3D printing and self-assembly technique related to assembling graphene into 3D architectures are compared and summarized, and thus enable the advance of a broad area of 2D materials-based structural and mechanical-related applications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","3D printing; Architectured graphene; Mechanical metamaterials; Microlattice; Nano-composites; Self-assembly","Composite structures; Graphene; Industrial research; Fabrication process; Manufacturing process; Physical and mechanical properties; Self-assembly method; Self-assembly technique; Structural applications; Threedimensional (3-d); Two Dimensional (2 D); 3D printers","","","","","City University of Hong Kong, (7005070, 9667164, 9667194); City University of Hong Kong; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61904141); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, (2020JQ-295); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province; Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, (JCYJ20170818103206501); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality; Shanxi Provincial Key Research and Development Project, (2020GY-252); Shanxi Provincial Key Research and Development Project","These authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee under the grant JCYJ20170818103206501.

Coated structures with porous substrates (infills) are often adopted in additive manufacturing to reduce the material cost and printing time, while improving robustness against local bucking, unknown loads and material deficiencies. This article presents a new density filter method for the topology optimization of coated structures. Compared to previous work, the new method uses only the density filter and its projection, and does not rely on the gradient of the density field, which can pose a numerical challenge in large-scale problems. Since the output of the proposed density filter is bounded exactly between zero and one, it will also eliminate the need to approximate the maximum magnitude of the density gradient, the inaccuracy of which can cause non-uniform thickness of the coating. The proposed filter also realizes a smoother change between substrate material and coating material, and encourages the merging and splitting of coatings during optimization. Several numerical examples on compliance minimization are presented to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed density filter. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","coated structure; density filter; PDE filter; Topology optimization","3D printers; Coatings; Numerical methods; Substrates; Thin walled structures; Topology; Compliance minimization; Density gradients; Large-scale problem; Maximum magnitudes; Merging and splitting; Non-uniform thickness; Numerical challenges; Substrate material; Structural optimization","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51975589); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2018JJ3663)","The financial supports were provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 51975589]; the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [grant number 2018JJ3663].

It is gaining its space inside the naval, aeronautics and space industries. However, there are key challenges to be solved in order to increase the performance of the WAAM process. Parts with curved shapes are difficult to manufacture with regular parallel layers without support because of an excessive overhang in certain regions. This paper proposes a methodology that solves this issue, by using incrementally angled layers with variable bead height, which eliminates or decreases the overhang between layers. This solution uses an angled rotary positioner (or other method for moving the part in a controlled way) and controls key parameters like the travel speed, the deposition angle, the available bead height difference, etc. The efficiency of the developed proposal is shown with the manufacture of a large curved steel (316L) piece as a use-case. © 2021, Editorial Institution of Wrocaw Board of Scientific.
